  - Environment ministry suspends clearance for Andhra project        OUR BUREAU                            A suspended Telugu Desam Party legislator shouts slogans after his arrest during a protest against the police firing at Sompeta on Thursday. Fifty-seven Desam legislators were suspended after the Opposition disrupted proceedings in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly demanding the resignation of a minister over the police firing. (PTI)                                         
	New Delhi/Hyderabad, July 15: The Union environment ministry this evening suspended its clearance for a thermal power plant in coastal Andhra Pradesh, hours after an environment tribunal announced a stay on it.        
	The National Environment Appellate Authority had this morning asked Nagarjuna Construction Company to stop work on the proposed plant in Srikakulam district, following the deaths of two fishermen in police firing at the project site.        
	The decision came as a shot in the arm for thousands of Andhra fisherfolk who had yesterday stormed the Rs 12,000-crore plant site in Srikakulam district, about 650 kms from Hyderabad, for fear that the facility would rob them of their livelihood and pollute drinking water sources.        
	In view of the unfortunate incident that took place (at Sompeta) yesterday and keeping in mind the public sentiment, the environmental clearance for this project stands suspended, the environment ministry said.        
	The ministry had given the project the go-ahead in December 2009 after receiving a report from the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa, that the site had no mangroves or wetlands and was not marshy land.        
	The ministry said it had received several representations against the site in the last few days, and had asked the regional chief conservator of forests, Bangalore, to visit the site and submit a report in two weeks.        
	Earlier, on a petition by an NGO, the environment tribunal asked the company to stop work in the Sompeta wetlands, upholding fears that fishing would be hit and the coastal environment threatened. It censured the Andhra government for misrepresenting that all the land in the Sompeta area was degraded wasteland.        
	But in the Assembly, where Telugu Desam legislators were suspended for creating a ruckus, Andhra revenue minister Dharmana Prasada Rao claimed the state had not handed the company any wetland.        
	The government has not acquired any wetland for the thermal power project. It gave the company only degraded coastal zone land not fit for cultivation, Rao said. He added such projects would create job opportunities and help stall the migration of educated rural youth.        
	State home minister Sabita Indra Reddy said the local fisherfolk had been provoked by NGOs like Paryavarana Rakshana Samiti to rise against police and the company.        
	Official sources in the state industry department and the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation said they would appeal against the verdict. This will affect all the thermal projects cleared for Srikakulam district, a spokesperson said.        
	Under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, no industrial activity is permitted on wetlands in India. Clearances have been given for at least six thermal plants in district, and proposals for two nuclear plants are in the works.        
	Sources in New Delhi said the environment ministry had decided to review clearances to three other thermal plants in Srikakulam district.        
	Fisherfolk, who depend on the marshy wetlands (beelas) for their livelihood, have been opposing the Sompeta plant since August because they fear industrial effluents will endanger marine life. But industry minister Rao had apparently brushed aside all objections till the fisherfolk erupted yesterday.        
	The situation in and around Sompeta remained tense after yesterdays police firing killed two fishermen. The police mounted night raids to pick up those behind the violence at the site of the 2,640 MW thermal plant. Over 50 people were arrested from the villages of Gollasgandi, Ramayyapatna, Isakapalem, Zinkibadra, Palasapuram, Benkili and Lakkavaram. Hundreds of policemen were deployed in a dozen coastal villages and Section 144 clamped in 20 others.        
	A curfew-like situation is prevailing as security personnel are not allowing us to move out of our homes. There are policemen in every nook and corner, we are living in fear. Anything can happen any time, said Bhaskar Rao, a schoolteacher of Gollagandi village.

	Deals in hand, Obama concedes two-way flow   
	Mumbai, Nov. 6: India today put its might where its mouth once was, handing the United States of America a life-saver of 53,670 jobs in one fell swoop and redeeming a generation that still remembers the long years of ship-to-mouth existence.        
	As President Barack Obama savoured the relief of wrapping up 20 Indian deals that can generate jobs back home, First Lady Michelle Obama danced to a Bollywood song 2km away.        
	 It appeared that the first day of the presidential tour was more about an undeclared coronation of India rather than whether a one-time minnow managed to squeeze out benevolence from a reigning monarch.                  
	The mood was captured by industrialist Anand Mahindra, who told a cheering audience at a panel discussion later: Its nice to see a hand being stretched towards us for a change.        
	Mahindra would have struck a chord among the Indian generation that was born in the 1950s and grew up during the next two difficult decades, feeding on American grain generosity till the Green Revolution filled the countrys granaries.        
	Half a century later, Indias granaries are overflowing, some to criminal wastage. The Indian economy is doing much better than most western powers and the country is in a position to offer other nations jobs, not just steal them as some critics of outsourcing have been claiming.        
	Obama acknowledged as much today. Meeting 25 Indian executives in the afternoon, he spoke of ties that hold incredible promise. But jobs were never far from the lips of the President, who badly needs to convince increasingly sceptical Americans that he can fix the economy.        
	Ties that hold incredible promise for people and our future. The promise of new jobs, industries and new growth. Whether or not that promise is fulfilled depends on us, on the decisions we take and partnerships we build in the coming years, Obama said.        
	Among the audience were some entrepreneurs who are working on start-ups for electric cars and water purifiers. Obama told the group that he wanted to hear from them about new ideas that could help create jobs in the US and emerging markets like India, said Shaffi Mather, a young Indian businessman who attended the meeting.        
	Many of the deals were already in the pipeline before todays formal announcement but the alacrity with which the Americans were holding them aloft as trophies reflected the intense pressure for jobs they face back home.        
	Among the deals is an order of 33 Boeing aircraft for SpiceJet that could generate about 12,000 jobs. While Obama was speaking in Nariman Point, his mind must have been in Chicago, his homeport where Boeing is headquartered.        
	 India is a delicate place for Obama to talk about jobs, given American concerns about outsourcing.         
	The President today steered clear of his campaign trail analogy of Bangalore-Boston (how American cities are losing jobs to Indian cities) but did mention old stereotypes.        
	These old stereotypes, these old concerns ignore todays reality, Obama said. In 2010, trade between our countries is not just a one-way street of American jobs and companies moving to India. It is a dynamic, two-way relationship that is creating jobs, growth, and higher living standards in both our countries.        
	If Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who flagged off the country on the road to reforms nearly two decades ago, was following developments with quiet vindication today, an unexpected political bonus also came his way.        
	The BJP launched an attack on Obama for omitting Pakistan in his speech at the Taj hotel while paying tribute to 26/11 victims.        
	 By this evening, an embarrassed BJP was speaking of calibrating the response tomorrow, realising that any mention of Pakistan by Obama would have struck at the root of the partys avowed bilateral issue stand. Besides, no head of state or government is expected to criticise another country by name from the soil of a third nation. Some western leaders had indeed named Pakistan earlier but had to pay a domestic price once they returned.        
	The afternoons sombre meeting at the Taj hotel against the backdrop of the Gateway of India was just the plank from which Obama dove into the business agenda that he enunciated at the US India Business Council meet in the evening at The Trident.        
	For Mumbaikars, hassled by the hyper-security around the President and his First Lady, it was a language that was easily understood: dhandha, the transactional nature of relationships. Obamarketeer has found dhandha here today, said a Mumbaikar.        
	Obama suggested Washington and New Delhi would work together for the US to lift export controls on certain high-technology items. He has also offered to support India as a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group  a tall order as it requires the support of 46 member-countries.        
	The push to the strategic partnership that Indian and US diplomats talk about was not on the table in Mumbai. Thats New Delhis job.        
	As Michelle rocked to Rang de Basanti, Indias money made music in Mumbai today.                    WITH INPUTS FROM NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ticked-off ministry told to hear out Lavasa
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Ticked-off ministry told to hear out Lavasa
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            The Lavasa project                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 7: Bombay High Court today stayed a notice sent by the Union environment ministry to Lavasa Corporation, which had stopped construction on the township project in Pune since November 25, and asked the government to hear out the developers.        
	At one point, the court termed the order by the ministry, headed by Jairam Ramesh, drastic. The court also reminded the government that the ministry was the enforcer of the law, not the dictator of the law.        
	The counsel for Lavasa made a voluntary statement in the court that no construction would be undertaken on the project till the court passes an order on December 16.        
	A division bench of Justices N.D. Deshpande and D.K. Deshmukh, who took over the case after the chief justice recused himself on Monday, said the showcause issued by the ministry did not justify the reason for the notice.         
	The ministry had asked why the unauthorised structures erected without any environment clearance should not immediately be demolished.        
	The bench said that since the ministry took no action against the project for six years after construction began in 2004, the ministry should give the developers a chance to present its case.        
	The court directed the ministry to hear Lavasa on December 9 and pass an order based on it by December 16.        
	The court also adjourned the hearing on a petition filed by Lavasa, challenging the notice and the status quo order of the ministry.        
	Challenging the notice, Lavasa has said the 5000-hectare township is a tourism project and does not require clearance from the central ministry.         
	The court questioned the environment ministrys delay in taking action against the project if it has been violating a rule passed in 2004  the year in which construction began.         
	The counsel for the ministry, additional solicitor-general Darius Khambatta told the court: The work commenced by the corporation is blatantly illegal. Though they knew they had to get clearances for the project, they only applied in 2009. The ministry does not want to compound illegality by allowing construction to continue.         
	The court, however, held that the ministry should have heard Lavasa before issuing the stop-work notice saying that the ministry should be fair and it was the enforcer of the law, not the dictator of the law.        
	The ministry should hear Lavasa on Thursday and it will be binding on the ministry to prepare its order in seven days.        
	The ministry will also hear the NGO, National Alliance of Peoples Movement, which had filed a public interest litigation against Lavasa earlier this year.        
	The organisation had raised fears about the construction of 11 dams by Lavasa for its project.        
	Lavasas lawyer Shekhar Nafade said the company had invested Rs 6,000 crore in the project.

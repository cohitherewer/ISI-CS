  - After India raises Pak offer, so does China          ARCHIS MOHAN                                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: A battle of benevolence has broken out to assist flood-wrecked Pakistan but the Asian giants have been beaten to the draw by the minnows.        
	India yesterday raised its offer of assistance from $5 million  not an amount befitting an aspiring superpower  to $25 million. Not before it was shamed into doing so by Afghanistan which stumped up $1 million  an amount lower than that of Indias initial offer but far more striking, considering the travails of the war-ravaged country.         
	If India is at play, can China  Islamabads all weather friend  be far behind in the Great Game of Generosity? Beijing, which according to a Pakistan government website had promised only $9 million till Monday, also increased its assistance to $25 million in relief materials, matching Indias offer.        
	The two countries now figure among the top 10 donors, according to the Country-wise Update of Foreign Assistance for Flood Affectees posted on the website of the Pakistan governments economic affairs division.        
	Indias first offer of $5 million, made on August 13, was described as delayed and niggardly coming as it did a fortnight after it was clear Pakistan was battling one of its worst natural calamities.        
	While the two regional superpowers took time to promise assistance, smaller and poorer South Asian countries were quicker off the blocks.        
	Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal were ahead of India in promising assistance to Pakistan, even before Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs appeal that all of South Asia should... extend every possible help to the affected people. On August 8, Sri Lanka dispatched 18 tonnes of dry rations and a group of doctors to Islamabad.                     
	The island country, struggling to rehabilitate people displaced by the war with Tamil Tigers last year, followed this up by sending another consignment of 18 tonnes of dry rations that included tea, medicines and 250 large cabin tents on August 23.        
	The countrys media and officials acknowledged how Pakistan had immensely supported Sri Lanka in its war against the Tamil Tiger terrorists by supplying arms and military training to Sri Lankan forces.        
	On August 9, Bangladesh offered $2 million in aid to Pakistan after a flash appeal from the UN. Soon enough, Nepal promised $1.3 million. It took four more days for India to respond.        
	But the Afghan government handing over $1million on August 17 appears to have prompted not only New Delhi but also Beijing to review their initial commitments. Kabul has also sent four helicopters to Peshawar to evacuate flood victims.         
	Sources say the Afghan offer made the Prime Ministers Office and the external affairs ministry increase the aid by $20million, consistent with Singhs offer on August 19 to Pakistan. Pakistan has asked India to route its assistance through the UN, which New Delhi has agreed to do.        
	Pakistans worst floods in 80 years have left 1,600 people dead and damaged or destroyed 1.2 million houses, affecting some 20 million people.        
	The floods have exposed regional groupings, such as the Organisation of Islamic Countries of which Pakistan is a member and, more significantly, the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation. The Saarc secretariat has not even been able to bring itself to issue a statement on the floods.

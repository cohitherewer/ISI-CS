          AMIT GUPTA                                     
	Ranchi, Jan. 8: Providing constructive leadership to the state with political stability along with a clean, transparent and sensitive administration with zero tolerance towards corruption are the priorities of the Shibu Soren government as articulated in the governors address to the state Assembly today.        
	During his 30-minute address, Governor K. Sankaranarayanan reiterated Sorens views on tackling the Naxalite problem by providing a responsive and accountable administration and implementing development and welfare schemes in the rural interiors as a means to try and win over the alienated youth force.        
	As decided during the first cabinet meeting chaired by Soren a few days ago, the emphasis of his government, the governor said, would be to complete a fresh survey of families living below the poverty line to ensure that entire population of the state get ration cards within a fixed time-frame.         
	The governor also pledged to provide 34kg foodgrain per month per BPL family and 35kg food grain per month per Antyodaya (poorest among poor) families free of cost to cope with the drought-like situation till the end of 2009-10 fiscal.         
	In the coming financial year of 2010-11, the governor pledged to make available 35kg of foodgrain and iodised salt to BPL families at minimum possible rates.         
	Another focus area of the government, he said, would be to expedite development of irrigation facilities as per the topographic condition of the state and execute integrated farming schemes (a brainchild of Soren) with greater vigour.         
	Reaching out to farmers, the governor announced that the total cost of premium would be reimbursed by the government in view of the drought-like situation.         
	The Agriculture Insurance Corporation of India had insured crops during Kharif, 2009 season worth Rs 1,000 crore against which farmers have paid Rs 26 crore as premium.         
	On industry, the governor said, the government wanted to strike a balance between the interest of land losers and development, by revisiting the draft resettlement and rehabilitation policy.        
	It would enable setting up of infrastructure and industries on one hand and ensure the protection of interests of displaced families on the other, the governor said.         
	Keeping in mind the slugging pace of the Centres rural electrification project  only 9,798 villages have benefited against a target of 19,737 villages  the government has promised to speed up its execution.         
	It also promised to work for the betterment of civic amenities in the cities under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM).         
	Throughout the governors address, Opposition members listened quietly. The House would debate the speech tomorrow.         
	But, senior JVM leader Pradeep Yadav made his displeasure public.         
	Promises will prove to be a farce. This government does not seem determined, he asserted.

                                Charles Darwin                            
	London, Feb. 5: Charles Darwin mapped mans ancestry  now scientists have used DNA from his great-great-grandson to trace his ancestry.        
	Published almost 200 years after Darwins birth, the results reveal that the father of evolutionary theory, who argued that all humans are descended from one common ancestor, comes from a long line of adventurers, his forbears being some of the first modern humans to leave Africa for West Asia.        
	The ambitious Genealogy Project, a five-year initiative backed by National Geographic and IBM, uses powerful new technology to examine DNA, allowing scientists to see back to the very earliest days of the human species and map how and when they moved around the globe.        
	 One of the 350,000 members of the public tested so far was Chris Darwin, a tour guide and adventurer who lives in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney.         
	Because genetic information is passed from father to son via the Y chromosome, Chris would share a large part of his genetic data with his great-great grandfather, who wrote The Origin of The Species.        
	Tests on Chriss DNA, collected from a swab of his saliva, showed that his ancestors, and those of Darwin himself, were among the first wave of modern humans to leave Africa for West Asia about 45,000 years ago.        
	From there, they travelled into Europe, surviving the Ice Age by migrating south to Spain, before moving north to England about 12,000 years ago. The tests revealed that Darwin belonged to the Haplogroup R1b, direct descendants of the Cro-Magnon people who dominated the human expansion into Europe and heralded the demise of the Neanderthals.        
	Chris, who migrated to Australia from England in 1986, said his great-great grandfather would have been fascinated by the results of the study. He would have been amazed by the amount of detail you can get looking at your genes and the fact that you can tell where your ancestors were at a certain time, he said.        
	Back then genetics was not understood at all, so he would have been fascinated to have seen that he got it basically right and that data like this is available.

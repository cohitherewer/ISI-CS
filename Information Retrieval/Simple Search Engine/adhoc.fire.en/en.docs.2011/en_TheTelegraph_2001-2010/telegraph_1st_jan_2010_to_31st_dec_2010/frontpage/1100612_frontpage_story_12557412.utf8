The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Catch Razas record work in Noida
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Catch Razas record work in Noida
          AMIT ROY                            Hugo Weihe, Christies international director of Asian art, auctions Razas Saurashtra                                  
	London, June 11: Syed Hyder Razas colourful and vibrant painting, Saurashtra, bought for a record 2,393,250 at a Christies auction in London yesterday will be open for viewing at a private museum in Noida by ordinary members of the public, the new owner has promised.         
	I am delighted and would love to see people come and see the painting at my museum, Kiran Nadar, wife of Shiv Nadar, chairman and chief strategy officer of HCL Technologies, said in a statement. The size and quality of this painting makes it a very sentinel work.        
	The 200cmx200cm work which Raza painted in 1983 was acquired by a collector in France where the 87-year-old artist lives though he has always said he carries India within him.        
	The two-day auction in South Kensington was preceded by a party with Indian food sponsored by Lakshmi Mittals wife, Usha, who is on the board of Christies.        
	One assumes she rang up her husbands friends and made encouraging noises along the lines, The Tyeb Mehta M.F. Husain Ganesh Pyne would look so good above your red sofa kitchen sink yours son rugby kit.        
	Anyway, it appears to have done the trick, given the hard work that has been put in behind the scenes by Christies international staff in New York and London who engaged in hand holding potential buyers  whether the work was 5,000, 50,000 or 500,000.        
	Day One of the auction, given over to the estate of Francis Newton Souza selected mainly from his apartment in New York, raised 5,449,025.        
	Out of 152 lots, only five didnt sell, said Yamini Mehta, senior specialist with Christies and director of its contemporary Indian art department.        
	She disclosed that a European collector came in through the doors, fell in love with Souzas Red Curse, which was on the catalogue cover, and bought it (for 881,250).        
	She said she and her colleagues at Christies had many, many sleepless nights, wondering whether they had pitched Razas Saurashtra right by predicting it might sell between 1.3m and 1.8m. But she was confident it would achieve that price.        
	In the event, the sale figure exceeded the previous record of 1,273,250, held jointly by Razas La Terre, sold in London in June 2008, and Souzas Birth, also in London that month.        
	Over the two days, the auction raised a total of 12.4 million, becoming the most valuable sale of this category in history.        
	The top 10 were: Razas Saurashtra, 2,393,250; Tyeb Mehtas Falling Bird, 1,049,250; Souzas Red Curse, 881,250; Vasudeo S. Gaitondes untitled work, 679,650; M.F. Husains untitled work (Arjuna and Krishna) 577,250; Subodh Guptas Chimta, 529,250; Souzas Christ, 349,250; Souzas Portrait of a Man, 265,250; Souzas (Lovers), 241,250; and Souzas White Man Black Woman, 241,250.        
	Though Raza was the focus of attention, for lovers of Jamini Roy, there were some attractive works on sale.         
	Sunset over the River Hooghly went for 15,000, a landscape for 25,000 and Drummer with Santhals for 2,250.        
	Mehta said some buyers saw their acquisitions, especially at the top end, as valuable investment. She also pointed out that live bidding via the Internet had opened up the auction to buyers who could be anywhere in the world.        
	We saw a number of new clients and returning clients from all over the world, said Mehta. There were bids from Hong Kong, Dubai, America, Taiwan. What we are seeing is that people want to put their money into assets that will hold their value. People are very savvy. The auction was conducted by Hugo Weihe, Christies international director of Asian art, who said: We are thrilled that this work (by Raza) will return to India as a fitting tribute to the artist and a celebration of art from this region. Masterworks by Subodh Gupta, Gaitonde and Tyeb Mehta all roared past their high estimates and cemented this sale as a benchmark for the season, the year and beyond. We are honoured that Maqbool Fida Husain attended the auction and pleased that he saw all works by his hand sell successfully.        
	M.F. Husain is still MF, a much respected figure, but somehow there seems less warmth for him among Indians since he announced he had been offered Qatari citizenship.        
	 This assessment of his motives may be very unfair and not take into account the extent of the hostility he has faced from Hindu fanatics but an Indian tycoon commented cynically: He wants to leave behind as much as money as possible by selling to Middle East buyers.

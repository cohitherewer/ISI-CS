	New Delhi, June 18: Rabindranath Tagore will next year gaze down on a country he had never visited in his lifetime but one he had described as the lamp of the East, striking a chord with its freedom fighters.        
	South Korean President Lee Myung Bak has promised to have a bust of the poet installed in Seoul.        
	The suggestion had come from foreign minister S.M. Krishna, who is on a South Korea trip, during a meeting with Lee.        
	Warming to the theme, President Lee said he would make a strong recommendation to the city authorities to identify a suitable location for installing the bust of Gurudev in 2011, a foreign ministry spokesperson said.        
	Many of Tagores works were translated into Korean soon after he won the Nobel prize in 1913. The ties were strengthened when, on a visit to Japan in 1924, Tagore had opposed the Japanese occupation of Korea in front of a large crowd.        
	Japan had declared Korea a protectorate in 1905 and annexed it in 1910.         
	Tagores poem Lamp of the East inspired many Koreans during the Japanese occupation, which ended in 1945.         
	Even today, a copy of the Gitanjali can be found in many Korean homes.        
	After gaining independence, Korea included a chapter on Lamp of the East in a textbook for high school students. A Tagore Society of Korea was founded in 1981.        
	Last year, Samsung Electronics and the South Korean embassy helped the Sahitya Akademi institute the Tagore Literature Awards in Indian languages, acknowledging a historical link.        
	Through his writings and poems, he touched the hearts of Koreans at a time they were passing through great difficulties. As a poet, playwright, philosopher and artist, he is as revered in Korea as he is in India, Samsung vice-chairman Y.W. Lee had said at the first awards function this year.        
	The Indian government is celebrating 2010-11 as the 150th year of Tagores birth.         
	Last month, during a state visit to China, President Pratibha Patil had unveiled a bust of Tagore in the Shanghai locality where the poet had lived during his two visits to the city.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Life after nonsense
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Life after nonsense
  - Will celebrate from tomorrow: Shah Rukh          PRATIM D. GUPTA                      Shah Rukh Khan                                
	Calcutta, Feb. 17: SRK flashing on the mobile screen at 9.33 in the morning can mean two things  either he is really disturbed about something or he is in some part of the world where its still night.         
	But once the familiar voice connects, it becomes clear Shah Rukh Khan is calling from his Mumbai bungalow Mannat and that he is extremely relaxed.        
	Everyones loving Rizvan and My Name is Khan at least half the battle has been won otherwise, because of all this nonsense, one has not paid attention to the film only, laughs Shah Rukh.         
	By nonsense SRK means the controversy surrounding the release of the film because of his statement about the Pakistani players participation in the IPL. After many bouts of frenzied tweeting on the Internet from Abu Dhabi and Berlin, the statement marks SRKs return to the real world from virtual space.         
	I think, somewhere, playing Rizvan also gave me the strength to say, okay, you cant keep making superheroes of people unless you can behave with a little more dignity in real life, he says. In the Karan Johar movie released last Friday, Shah Rukhs Rizvan Khan is an Asperger syndrome patient who conquers his fear of social interaction to spread the message of humanity.        
	We were very worried for Maharashtra when the film opened but it seems that it doesnt make a difference now, smiles Shah Rukh. The films doing stupendous business and I am so happy that it has spread all over India like that.         
	Not just India, where MNIKs first weekend collection (Rs 29.5 crore net) is second only to the all-time biggest blockbuster 3 Idiots (Rs 37.5 crore net), the Shah Rukh-Kajol-starrer has also smashed many a box-office record overseas (total of Rs 25 crore net) where it has done better than the Aamir Khan film (total of Rs 18.5 crore net).        
	Comparing the films fate with Rizvans arduous but fulfilling journey in the film, Shah Rukh says: Its quite coincidental. Normally film reflects life life doesnt reflect film. But for the first time, it seems like that. What one was saying in the film is now happening around.        
	But SRK confesses that the trauma around the release has not let him rejoice in the success of MNIK. Last few days I have not been able to enjoy at all. I just want to sit down now and watch the film at home. I will celebrate from tomorrow.        
	Constant calls from distributors and exhibitors in India also did not allow him to breathe easy at the Berlin International Film Festival, where the film was screened last week.         
	The response was fantastic wish I could have been in a better state of mind, he says. I really went to Berlin thinking I would have a holiday... I thought main jaoonga, picture release hogi, I will just have some good wine, relax and watch. But I hardly had any time.                  
	It was important for Shah Rukh that MNIK scored big at the box office, given that his last major release was Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi in end-2008 whose success had faded almost instantly when Aamirs Ghajini rocked the country within weeks.        
	Last year, a back surgery kept Shah Rukh away, his home production Billu didnt do too well and his IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders came last in South Africa.         
	Anything that I was doing for MNIK made me happy because I wasnt doing anything else for the rest of last year, he recalls. In the middle of that, we lost in IPL so badly. So shooting for this film was like going to work everyday and diverting your mind it was therapeutic throughout. It was difficult shooting for the film because it was all over America. I had taken some cortisones and then there was the surgery I was in a lot of pain. But the kind of film it was, it just helped me to go over it.        
	Now its time for the cricket team owner to set the record straight on the greens. I am coming to Calcutta by the end of the month. Inshallah KKR will do well this time.

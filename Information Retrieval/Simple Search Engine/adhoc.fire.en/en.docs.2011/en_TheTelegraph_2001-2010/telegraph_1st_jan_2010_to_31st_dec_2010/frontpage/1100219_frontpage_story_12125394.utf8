	Austin (Texas), Feb. 18 (AP): A small plane crashed into an office building that houses a Texas office of the US tax agency today.        
	Officials said they were investigating whether it was an intentional act by the pilot.        
	CNN, quoting a federal official, reported that a pilot intentionally crashed a small aircraft into the Internal Revenue Service building next to an FBI office in Austin. The official said the pilot had set his own house on fire before flying a small plane and crashing it into the building, CNN said.        
	No terrorist link was suspected, the department of homeland security said.        
	Assistant Austin Fire Chief Harry Evans said at least one person was missing and two people were taken to a hospital. The crash sent workers fleeing as ceilings crumbled, windows shattered and flames shot out of the building.        
	Thick black and grey smoke was billowing out of the second and third stories of the building as fire crews using ladder trucks and hoses battled the blaze..        
	Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Lynn Lunsford said the pilot did not file a flight plan. He did not identify the pilot.

JHA                            A monkey tries to enter A Rajas New Delhi house that was raided by the CBI on Wednesday. At least 14 premises, including that of the former telecom ministers relatives and a business associate, were searched by the CBI. (PTI picture)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The Centre has seized on a Supreme Court comment to swivel the 2G spotlight towards the BJP-led NDA regime, holding up raids on A. Raja and his associates as evidence of its intention to get to the bottom of the scandal.        
	The issue involved here is not only the huge amounts but it is a much more wider canvas. What happened in 2001 needs to be looked at, Justice G.S. Singhvi, the senior judge leading a two-judge bench hearing the 2G allocation case, said today.        
	In 2001, Pramod Mahajan, the late BJP leader, held the office of telecom minister. He was followed by Arun Shourie, Dayanidhi Maran and then Raja, who recently resigned.        
	The top courts comments could embarrass the BJP, now in opposition and spearheading the Parliament protest that has crippled almost an entire session for the first time in the country.        
	Without wasting time, the Congress circulated some documents that carried the purported signatures of Mahajan and Shourie to suggest that the loss caused during the NDA regime also ran into thousands of crores. It also emerged that the government is working on a dossier to publicise the alleged telecom misdeeds that occurred during the NDA regime.        
	Rajas counsel T.R. Andhyarujina had earlier defended the former ministers decision to allot rather than auction 2G in 2008 at 2001 prices by citing policy continuity followed by the department. He had named two of his predecessors Shourie and Maran in this context.         
	At least 53 2G licences were allotted during their stints in office, Rajas counsel had contended to defend the then ministers decision to hand them out in 2008 at 2001 prices.        
	CBI counsel K.K. Venugopal today said the investigative agency was looking at what happened in 2001, too, as part of its probe into the scam.        
	The UPA government also sought to regain the moral high ground by cracking down on Raja and several others. The CBI searched several places in Delhi and Tamil Nadu. It also informally questioned Raja during a raid on his house in Delhi.        
	In an unusual disclosure, the CBI claimed on record that incriminating documents were found during the raids. Such revelations are usually made off the record with officials preferring to remain anonymous.        
	We have found incriminating documents from the premises and all the papers are being examined. No arrest has been made so far, said Vineeta Thakur, the CBI deputy inspector-general.         
	CBI sources said the uncommon step was intended at addressing the concerns of the Supreme Court, which has pulled up the agency for its tardy pace of investigation.        
	However, political sources said the UPA government had decided to distance itself from Raja as it prepared to turn up the heat on the NDA.         
	Sources said the Prime Minister has decided that the scandal-prone telecom portfolio will not be returned to the DMK. Patriarch M. Karunanidhi has already been taken into confidence.        
	As the raids rolled from north to south today, Karunanidhi also nuanced his unequivocal support for Raja, saying we will not hesitate to take action if he is found guilty.

                                Crucial talks                            
	Washington, March 23 (PTI): Secretary of state Hillary Clinton today said the US will consider Pakistans request for a nuclear deal as Islamabad sought atomic cooperation and military hardware to bring itself at par with India.        
	Before the start of strategic talks between the two countries, Pakistan submitted a 56-page document to the Obama administration seeking, among other things, a nuclear deal and drone technology.        
	Despite Indias reservations, Clinton made it clear that the issue of energy would be one of the subjects at the talks. However, she refused to pass judgment on the outcome of the dialogue. Clinton said the US wanted to help Pakistan meet its immediate and long-term energy needs.        
	I am sure thats going to be raised and we are going to be considering it but I cant pre-judge or pre-empt what the outcome of our discussions will be, Clinton said when asked whether Pakistan will sign a nuclear deal with the US similar to the one Washington has with India.

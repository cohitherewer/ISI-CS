	Ranchi/Bokaro, March 15: Security forces continued phase II of flushout operations in Maoist strongholds in Bokaro, Latehar and Ghatshila with DGP Neyaz Ahmed confirming that Bengal too had mounted an offensive across the border with East Singhbhum.        
	Ahmed, who held a meeting in the evening to review the progress of the operations, told The Telegraph that the security forces had recorded some initial success, but added he would reveal details only tomorrow.        
	Senior officials claimed the operations, on to detect and neutralise rebel camps spread across Ghatshila, Chaibasa, Latehar, Chatra, Rahe (Ranchi) and Bokaro and its areas bordering Giridih, may not have led to large-scale arrests, but were key to enabling the forces seal hitherto vulnerable areas.        
	In the Bokaro region, security forces launched todays operation around 3am with the aim of scouring an area of 100sqkm spread over Nawadih and covering Nimiaghat, Madhuban and Parasnath hills (Giridih district).        
	Led by CRPF company commander R.P. Singh, his associate R. Bhangur, Giridih SP Ravikant Dhan, BSF ASP Sanjay Kumar and Bermo ASP Mayur Patel, the team comprised three companies of CRPF, one company each of Jharkhand Jaguars (JJ) and the Special Task Force (STF), along with more than 250 district police personnel.         
	Acting on specific information, they searched over three dozen villages, many of which were known to be Maoist hideouts.        
	Seven persons were picked up for questioning after security forces detected a 20kg Claymore mine planted at a culvert between Kusumadih and Bhawani jungles in the Nawadih police station area bordering Giridih district.        
	CRPFs 26th battalion commandant V.S. Sharma said the operations were initiated on specific information from the Nichla Ghat area of Nawadih, with the forces concentrating on the villages of Banaso and Anadi Kanadih  in Bokaro  while two other teams zeroed in on Maoist strongholds of Nimiaghat, Madhuban hills and Parasnath hills in Giridih.        
	Sharma said his men came across several functional camps that had been deserted by fleeing Maoists. The search operations in specific villages proved that the Maoists had moved out not long ago. The operations will continue, he said, but refused to elaborate on the areas.        
	IG of North Chhotanagpur zone Kishan Singh Meena expressed confidence that the Maoists were cornered since the security forces had well and truly sealed the entire zone.        
	Chaibasa police arrested one person, suspected to be courier for the rebels, with half a dozen can bombs, around 100 utensils and a motor bike near Posaita village under Goelkera police station. But Chaibasa SP Akhilesh Jha refused to divulge his name.        
	Operations continued in Tandwa, Piparwar and Simaria in Chatra bordering Latehar and Ranchi districts. But, this time, the forces also plugged escape routes in Khelari.        
	Balumath, Rahe and Bundu in Ranchi were also being scanned by the forces.         
	We are yet to make any recovery, conceded Chatra SP Deo Bihari Sharma.

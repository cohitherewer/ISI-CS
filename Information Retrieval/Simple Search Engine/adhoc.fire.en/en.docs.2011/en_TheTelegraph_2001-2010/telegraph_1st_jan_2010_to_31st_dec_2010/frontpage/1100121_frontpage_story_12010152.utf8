          SUJAN DUTTA                                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 20: The Centre accorded a state funeral to Jyoti Basu on a proposal from the Bengal government, a Union home ministry letter to the state chief secretary makes it clear.        
	Soldiers of the armys 6 Grenadiers battalion, currently assigned to the Eastern Command headquarters in Fort William, prepared a gun carriage and identified the pall-bearers from among its officers after the Union home ministry advised the defence ministry to go by the protocol for a state funeral.        
	The irony of the state funeral for Basu lay in the mingling of the notes of the communist anthem, the Internationale, sung by his comrades, with the notes of the national anthem, played by the military band. The event also went against the professed aversion of communists to such pomp.        
	The Bengal governments resident commissioner in New Delhi had yesterday told The Telegraph that the chief secretarys letter had asked the Centre for a two-day state mourning and a military funeral.        
	 But in Calcutta, CPM leaders claimed off the record that the suggestion for a state funeral for Basu was verbally made from the Centre at a very high level.        
	The CPM leaders did not show any documentation of such a suggestion. But the home ministry letter (see graphic which shows a part of the document) suggests the Bengal government asked for  and got  a state funeral.        
	According to the home ministry letter, the proposal (fax message no. 17-CS/2010) was sent by Bengal chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti to Union home secretary G.K. Pillai within a couple of hours after Basus death was announced at noon on Sunday (January 17).        
	The Union home ministrys advisory to the defence ministry was sent on the same day.        
	The armys additional director-general (ceremonials), currently supervising preparations for the Republic Day parade, temporarily disengaged himself from the militarys biggest annual ceremonies and issued instructions for the state funeral in Calcutta.        
	In his death, Jyoti Basu was given a three-volley rifle salute by the state police, several notches down the protocol ladder than the 21-gun salute normally reserved for heads of state or for a soldier killed in action or for the hoisting of the national flag on Republic Day and Independence Day.        
	In a 21-gun salute  the highest in military funereal rites  cannons fire 21 blanks one after the other into the air. In colonial times, the British used the salute system to grade princely states.         
	In the advisory to the defence ministry, the home ministry concurs with the proposal of the Bengal government that:        
	 State mourning will be declared in Bengal on January 18 (Monday) and January 19 (Tuesday, the day of the funeral)        
	 The national flag will fly at half-mast in Bengal        
	 A state funeral will be accorded to Basu in Calcutta.  
	A state funeral is a military tradition to honour martyrs but it has been appropriated by many countries, like India, for public death ceremonies of select notables.  
	The symbolism of the gun carriage emerged from battlefields from where the bodies of the fallen would be transferred on wheeled platforms.

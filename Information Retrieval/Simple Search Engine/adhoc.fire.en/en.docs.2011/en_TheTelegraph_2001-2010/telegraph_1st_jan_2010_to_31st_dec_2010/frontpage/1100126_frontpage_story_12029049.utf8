          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Jan. 25: Spurned love and jealousy probably led lecturer Birlang Narzary to kill a third semester girl student at his Gauhati University quarters last night, preliminary investigations have revealed.        
	The university authorities today suspended Narzary, a lecturer in the department of Bodo language, on the charge of murdering the student.         
	Narzary, who tried to commit suicide by consuming phenyl, has been arrested and is undergoing treatment at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital.         
	He went to Jalukbari police station around 9.15 last night and informed the police that he had killed a girl in his official quarters.         
	The body of Jharna Wari, a third semester student of Bodo language, was later recovered from the house.         
	A bachelor, Narzary used to stay alone at quarter number 10A.         
	A police official said Narzary and Jharna were probably having an affair. From what we have gathered, Jharnas marriage had been fixed with a doctor based in Dibrugarh. Narzary and Jharna probably had a fight over this, resulting in the murder, the official said.         
	He said there was an injury mark on the back of Jharnas head.         
	We have recovered a hammer from the drawing room which could be the object used to kill Jharna, he added.         
	Vomit and a broken mobile set littered the floor of the drawing room where the body lay.        
	A boarder of hostel RCC 3, where Jharna stayed in room number 15, said she had gone out around 5pm.         
	Narzarys quarter is about 500 metres from the hostel.         
	The police official said the murder may have taken place around 6pm, going by the degree of rigor mortis (recognisable signs of death) when police finally found it just before 10pm.         
	While Jharna hails from Bijni, Narzary is from Tamulpur.         
	Narzary joined the university about two years ago and has been staying at the quarters for the past five months. The adjacent quarter (number 10B), on the same compound, is vacant.         
	Although the sensational killing has raised questions about the security of the university hostel boarders, the general secretary of the Post-graduate Students Union of the university, Pallavi Saikia, said it was a mistake on Jharnas part to have visited the professors residence alone in the evening.         
	Although it is a rule that boarders of the girls hostel return before 7pm, many students stay out late for practical classes.

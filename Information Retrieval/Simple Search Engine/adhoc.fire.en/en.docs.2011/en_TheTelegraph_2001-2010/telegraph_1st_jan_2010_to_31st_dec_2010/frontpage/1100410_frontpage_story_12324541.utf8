The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PC accepts the buck, PM ducks   A bomb under every tree
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                PC accepts the buck, PM ducks     A bomb under every tree
          SUJAN DUTTA                                                    
	Tadmetla Tekri (Dantewada), April 9: Commando Balachander was resting his AK-47 rifle against a mahua tree this afternoon when he saw this sprig of mushroom. And then he raised the alarm.         
	It was a two-inch tape cut from a translucent sheet of grey plastic.         
	To fashion a trigger, the Maoists have sewn copper wire into the ends of this tape. The tape was folded but not pressed. If the wires touched, it would detonate a bomb.        
	Balachander called out to a Sardar from the bomb disposal squad. He neutralised it. The wires from the trigger led to a can of a well-known brand of babyfood buried just under the surface of the red earth. Yellow wire  the disposal expert called it Cordex  was tied into small knots and stashed into the can. It resembled the small intestine as depicted in physiology/biology textbooks.        
	The explosive was inside the wire. They must have got it from the NMDC (National Mineral Development Corporation) or some other mining company, said the Sardar at the foot of this hillock where the bodies were felled. Tadmetla Tekri has been named by the police. The Gond villagers call it Gudgud Gubaad.        
	The police and people do not speak the same language in these villages around Chinta Gufa  the name translates as thought cave.        
	Balachander is a commando from the 201 Cobra (Combined Battalion for Resolute Action)  the special force raised from the CRPF for the counter-Naxalite operations  endearingly called Littey by his comrades.         
	He is Tamil and therefore the association with the LTTE that is often called Littey in Hindi. He is a bomb detection specialist. In 15 minutes, he finds three other similar bombs. He bends down and picks up a shell. It is from a 303 light machine gun, he says.        
	There is a bomb under every **** tree, he swears. And this is a bloody forest.        
	The killing field in the Battle of Mukram is around this Tekri. Much of it is in a clearing, really. At one place, where they found 20 bodies, the men were blown to bits when they were taking position to fire from behind an embankment over which a track runs.        
	The track is over a small bridge supported by a hollowed-out trunk of a tree. The trunk was filled with a solution of ammonium nitrate and other chemicals. The Maoists detonated the deadly trunk exactly where they thought the CRPF men from the company of the 62nd battalion would take position.        
	The hollowed-out trunk is still intact, remarkably, despite the explosive that was packed into it. The Maoists used the trunk like the barrel of a cannon to direct the impact of the blast.        
	Two days after the killings, this battlefield bears all the marks of the massacre. In the middle of a small field, a splotch of blood has gone black. The blood has seeped into a cap. The blood and the cap had the same owner.        
	A few metres from it, a magazine holder  the men were on an operation, heavily armed and with plenty of rounds of ammunition  with the velcro unfastened, is lying among a broken packet of gram (chana). The magazine and the ammunition were taken away by the rebels.        
	They probably had chana in plenty.        
	By the hollowed-out tree trunk, pieces of bone are like crumbs mixed in the mud. In the afternoon, the smell of death hangs heavy, it just doesnt go away, draping all who come near it.         
	Strands of human hair are stuck into the bark of a Sal tree behind which a trooper took position to fire when he triggered a babyfood bomb.        
	Seven months after it was launched right here, Operation Green Hunt has been served hair trigger and babyfood bomb.         
	On September 18 last year, men of the 201 Cobra  the same unit that was deployed here on Thursday to escort Chhattisgarh police chief Viswa Ranjan, military adviser to the home ministry Brig D.S. Dadwal and senior officers of the CRPF and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police made up the vanguard of the state forces.        
	That day, the Cobras with the 62nd CRPF, special police officers (from Salwa Judum) and Chhattisgarh police entered the jungles between Chinta Gufa and Mukram to destroy a suspected arms factory. In the three-day fight, the Cobras lost six men including two commanders.        
	That was Operation Green Hunt, a three-day search-and-destroy mission. Though the Union home ministry denies its existence, the name now implies the entire counter-Maoist offensive in the country. It also has other names  Police Week, Operation Godavari and Operation Indravati.        
	In January, the Chhattisgarh government announced that 107 Maoists had been killed in the operations till then. The number of tribals killed was not specified. Civil rights groups were not allowed access to these areas and the toll was speculated to be 135.        
	This is where killing is ritual. It was not as if it did not happen before Green Hunt. In front of the Chinta Gufa police station where its sentry is perched in a bunker that overlooks a large lake with green shores and where herons are looking for fish, there is a plaque of black marble.        
	This is what the inscription in Hindi reads: On April 10, 2009, (exactly a year ago) these CRPF soldiers from the 55th battalion were martyred in Paidiguda after killing 25-30 Maoists: Deputy commandant Divakar Tiwari, assistant commandant Jaipal Singh, havildar Ram Swarup, havildar K. Balamurugan, havildar R. Murgan, havildar Bharat Ram, constable C.P.V. Reddy, constable Narayan Ray, constable Pramod Kumar and constable Bheerma Ram.        
	May there be a fair in their names every year. That will be a fitting tribute to those who gave their lives for the nation. Beside the memorial is a huge milestone. On it, the police have written: Welcome to Heaven.        
	Two seasons have changed since Green Hunt took off from here. The trees have shed leaves and the forests are now a pale brown and a pale grey. They are spiked with babyfood bombs.

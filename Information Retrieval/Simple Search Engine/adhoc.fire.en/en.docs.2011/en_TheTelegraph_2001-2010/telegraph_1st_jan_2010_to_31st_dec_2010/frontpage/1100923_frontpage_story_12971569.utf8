The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Employee protest shuts down court
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Employee protest shuts down court
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                            Protesters at a high court gate. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	All but one of the seven high court gates remained shut and not a single case was heard on Day One of the indefinite employees strike to press for new pay scales.         
	About 1,700 employees, supporting five unions, have joined the protest. Group D employees, who operate the gates, only allowed the judges to enter the premises on Wednesday.        
	This is the first time high court gates remained closed through the day and lawyers were denied access. The high court administration should be more active to restore normality in the court, said Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, the vice-president of the Calcutta High Court Bar Association.         
	Around 4pm, state finance secretary C.M. Bachwat and law secretary K.Y.S. Manhas met Chief Justice J.N. Patel in his high court chamber and discussed the situation. Around 4.30pm, the chief justice and the other judges left the court.         
	Saibal Ghosh, the secretary of the Calcutta High Court Employees Welfare Association, said they were forced to shut down the court as the government was not implementing the recommendations of a high court-appointed committee.         
	In 2007, the then chief justice had set up the three-judge committee that recommended a special pay-scale for the high court employees.        
	Though the state government pays the salaries of the high court employees, their pay-scale is different from that of the central and state government employees.         
	According to Debabrato Chakrabarty, the secretary of the Calcutta High Court Officers Association, Chief Justice J.N. Patel had written to the state authorities on August 27, requesting them to implement the recommendations but the government did not act.         
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta and I met the chief justice yesterday and told him that the government was considering the employees demand. At this point, the strike is illegal and unjust, said state law minister Rabilal Moitra on Wednesday.

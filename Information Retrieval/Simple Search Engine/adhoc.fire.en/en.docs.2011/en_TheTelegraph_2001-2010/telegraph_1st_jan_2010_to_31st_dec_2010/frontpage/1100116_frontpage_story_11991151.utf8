                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Hands folded, talks diktat to Maoists 
          OUR BUREAU                            Mamata at the meeting in Jhargram where she issued the appeal to the Maoists. Picture by Samir Mondal                                  
	Jan. 15: Mamata Banerjee today declared her willingness to touch the feet of Maoists to nudge them towards the talks table and topped up the appeal with a seven-day ultimatum.        
	I am giving you seven days to come to the negotiation table to discuss your problems concerning Jangal Mahal. Or else, I shall launch padayatras in Lalgarh, Belpahari, Binpur, Salboni and other areas in West Midnapore to restore peace and rule of law, the Trinamul chief told a rally in Jhargram town, about 170km from Calcutta, this afternoon.        
	The appeal, in her first public rally in the rebel-infested zone in nearly six months, came hours after a Maoist-backed outfit dared Mamata to come out of the government that had sent forces to crush their democratic movement.        
	Mamatadi is part of the Union government that sent forces to crush our democratic movement. If she has guts, she should come out of the government, said Dhanapati Mahato, leader of the Jhargram unit of the Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities, a tribal outfit she had backed when it was launched.        
	Last week, however, Mamata had lashed out at the committees arrested chief. Who is Chhatradhar Mahato? she had thundered. He is the CPMs creation.        
	The outburst reflected her increased eagerness to distance herself from the Maoists ever since party guest Kabir Suman had embarrassed her by insisting he would sing paeans to Chhatradhar.        
	The singer-MP embarrassed her yet again when he told STAR Ananda he would not compromise on his freedom of expression.         
	Today, Mamata was restrained through her 50-minute speech at the Jhargram municipality ground, about 40km from Lalgarh.         
	I appeal to you with folded hands to shun violence and give up arms. For the sake of peace in Jangal Mahal, I can even touch your feet. But for Gods sake, start negotiations. Kintu saber aage, landmine chhere lifeliney phire aashun (But first of all, give up landmines and join the mainstream), she said.        
	If necessary, I shall try my best to prevail upon the Union government to meet your demands, including withdrawal of joint forces from Lalgarh.         
	The Centre had earlier said it was willing to hold talks with the Maoists if they halted bloodshed.        
	Mamata also suggested she might play mediator if the Maoists wanted her to. I will be happy to assist your talks with the Centre. However, if you consider me untouchable, you are at liberty to choose your interlocutor. But what is of utmost importance is dialogue.         
	The afternoon meeting was Mamatas first in Jhargram since the joint forces entered Lalgarh in June. Mamata had cancelled a rally in Midnapore town on January 4, fearing that Maoists would join in large numbers.        
	Todays rally, however, drew a moderate crowd as people from Maoist-infested Salboni, Belpahari and Binpur were stopped from joining. Trinamul district chairman Mrigen Maity conceded the party had to hire 200 vehicles to fetch party workers from non-Maoist areas.        
	Mamata admitted she had collaborated with the Peoples Committee when it was launched. But I had to withdraw when they resorted to violence and killings, she said.        
	Asit Mahato, the current spearhead of the committee, said they could begin discussions provided the joint forces are withdrawn. We dont trust Mamata who has insulted our leader Chhatradhar Mahato, he said.         
	Mamata said she planned to work out development projects for Jangal Mahal by introducing train services in Salboni, Belpahari, Binpur and Jhargram.

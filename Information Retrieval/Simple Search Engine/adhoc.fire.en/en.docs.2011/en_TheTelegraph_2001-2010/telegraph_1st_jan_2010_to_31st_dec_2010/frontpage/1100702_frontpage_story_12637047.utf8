          A STAFF REPORTER                            OPEN DEFIANCE: Debolina Chakraborty (in red circle) presents her case at Jadavpur University on Thursday afternoon. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya				                                 
	Jadavpur University on Thursday played host to a press conference by an ex-student who stands accused under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).        
	Debolina Chakraborty, who graduated in political science in 2005 and then quit her MA midway, used the sparkling new portico in front of the Centenary Hall in the arts faculty to allege that she had been framed as a Naxalite member by police.        
	Under the nose of the state administration, the police and the university authorities, the alleged member of the Nandigram zonal committee of the CPI (Maoist) who even uses a room in the IR (international relations) Ladies Hostel three years after she ceased being a student of JU, held forth for over two hours.        
	How was the 28-year-old  who had formed the Matangini Mahila Samity in Nandigram three years ago  allowed to air her political views on campus? Registrar Pradip Kumar Ghosh pleaded helplessness: We cannot stop any ex-student from entering the campus. But at the same time we definitely do not support the way Debolina used the university premises to address an issue which is in no way related to academic matters.        
	According to the JU rulebook, anyone wanting to hold a press conference on campus must give a written notification to the registrar stating the time, venue and purpose and seeking his approval. No outsider should be given permission when it has nothing to do with the varsity or academics.        
	Several students and teachers of JU were left wondering why the police allowed Debolina to get away with it unhindered even after an FIR under the UAPA had been lodged against her with Sonarpur police station.        
	The police watched as Debolina launched into a tirade against the administration. We feared a backlash from a section of students if we tried to arrest her on campus. We are waiting for an opportune moment, said a CID officer.

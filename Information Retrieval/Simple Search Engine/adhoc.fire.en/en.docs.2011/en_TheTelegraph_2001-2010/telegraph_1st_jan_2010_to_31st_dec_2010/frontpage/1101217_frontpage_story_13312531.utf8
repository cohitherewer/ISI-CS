The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | No asset split in Indian divorce 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                No asset split in Indian divorce 
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                            The couple in happier times                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: Had Arun Nayar been in India, he could not have asked for a share of Liz Hurleys assets in a divorce case even if he admitted to being financially weaker.         
	Neither could Hurley have asked for a division of Nayars property, for that matter, had she been the weaker partner.        
	Theres no talk of division of assets in Indian divorce laws, Supreme Court lawyer Pinky Anand said.         
	Financial settlements are limited to paying maintenance. On this count, the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act are gender-neutral, allowing the spouse with the smaller income to seek maintenance. But nothing more, Anand stressed.        
	Muslim and Christian personal laws do not allow a man to even claim maintenance.        
	Under the gender-neutral British law, which will apply in Nayars case, the weaker spouse can stake claim to a share of the others assets.        
	In India, the law feels there is no need for a couple to share their property, womens rights activist Kirti Singh said. Whatever the man has is his. Similarly, the womans property is hers. That has to change, she added.        
	The Domestic Violence Act, 2005, takes a small step towards division of assets by allowing women to seek a portion of the marital home or rent in lieu of it.         
	But the concept of equal division of assets built by a couple during a marriage does not exist, Singh said.        
	Which is perhaps why even the few pre-nuptial agreements that are signed in India are limited to maintenance or return of dowry, because there is no threat of either partner losing half their wealth in a divorce.        
	Britain recently recognised pre-nups as legally valid, bringing its law on a par with the rest of Europe.        
	In India, a pre-nup in the nature of a contract is legally valid and can be produced in case either party refuses to abide by its terms.         
	It is then only of a persuasive value, Singh said, adding that a suit of specific performance could also be filed to force the party which reneges to abide by its terms.         
	Nayar, of course, did not sign one because it wasnt romantic. But had he done so in India, the court would have factored it in while deciding his maintenance entitlement.        
	Pre-nups are no longer unheard of in India. Its coming up, although its still not a dime a dozen, Anand said.         
	But the social stigma associated with such agreements makes it uncommon for any except the rich and the famous to sign them.        
	Conceptually, it is difficult to handle. In India, where marriage is still considered sacrosanct, no one wants to take about the eventuality of the marriage falling apart, Anand said. We dont hear of any pre-nups among the middle class.         
	Its usually common in cases of divorce by mutual consent for the two parties to come up with a common arrangement in the nature of a post-nup to facilitate the divorce. Otherwise, the unhappy partner could always withhold the mandatory consent for divorce required after a six-month cooling off period of filing the application.        
	The absence of the concept of equal division of marital assets in Indian law works against women, Singh said, adding the woman suddenly finds her home is not hers and cannot even claim any assets bought for the house.        
	Except in Goa, which is the only state in the country where a division regime exists. In the western state once ruled by the Portuguese, all property or income acquired during a marriage goes into a joint pool which is split equally when the marriage ends, Singh said.

	New Delhi, Feb. 4: In a swift move tailed on Shiv Shankar Menons appointment as national security adviser (NSA), Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reactivated the controversial Sharm el-Sheikh resolve today and pushed afresh for dialogue with Pakistan even in the absence of concrete and demonstrable action against terror outfits.         
	The Pakistani foreign secretary has been invited to Delhi for talks on all relevant issues, including counter-terrorism. Consultations over the dates are on and sources in the ministry of external affairs (MEA) indicated that talks could well open before home minister P. Chidambarams visit to Pakistan towards the month-end for a Saarc meeting.        
	There isnt any clarity yet on whether this means the run-up to a resumption of comprehensive dialogue; sources were keener it be seen as opening a crack in the door to see if and how far we can progress.        
	Islamabad welcomed the move with alacrity but notably mentioned Kashmir and water-sharing disputes as issues it would like to flag along with counter-terrorism.        
	Kashmir is currently in the grip of renewed street ferment; and in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), secessionist and terrorist elements led by Syed Salahuddin of Hizb-ul Mujahideen and Jamaat-ud-Dawa boss Hafiz Saeed have planned a rally to intensify efforts for Kashmiri liberation.         
	A significant aspect of todays official announcement was that it was not attributable even to unnamed sources in the MEA, the nodal agency for foreign policy pronouncements. The initiative has come from the very top, a senior MEA official told The Telegraph. This is the Sharm el-Sheikh team at work, and it is very clear that they, rather than the MEA, will set the agenda and atmospherics for the dialogue. We will be the instruments.         
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna was flying home from Kuwait at the time the government made its invitation known. By the time Krishna landed in Delhi mid-afternoon, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao had already been on the phone to her Pakistani counterpart, Salman Bashir, and conveyed New Delhis wish to resume talks.         
	But it may not be that Krishna was entirely unaware of what was afoot in his absence; he had struck a newly conciliatory tone on Pakistan while in Kuwait and possibly had more than a hint that a major move was in the works. But government sources confirmed that the decision itself was entirely formulated by the PMO.        
	Prime Minister Singh and Menon, then foreign secretary, remain chiefly credited with the authorship of the Sharm el-Sheikh statement which delinked composite dialogue with terror-related issues and, in a first, brought up Balochistan as a Pakistani concern.        
	The agreement was ripped by the Opposition as a sellout and created misgivings within the UPA over whether India had ceded too much to Pakistan in its bid for a breakthrough.         
	Defending his government following a charged debate in Parliament, Singh had repeated his promise to meet Pakistan more than half way if it acted against terror outfits and said, the only way forward is to begin to trust each other despite all that has happened in the past.         
	But it has been known for a while that the Prime Minister faced opposition from sections within his own establishment over unlocking the door for dialogue without concrete progress on Indias terror grudge, particularly in relation to the Mumbai attack.         
	The Sharm el-Sheikh agreement was cold-plated. Talks remained a letter of intent, withheld on the grounds that outraged public opinion in India wasnt prepared to back such a move.        
	All this time, though, there was a section in Singhs PMO that advocated his talks-are-the-only-way line, arguing that public opinion was more likely to endorse initiatives for peace rather than continued freeze and tension.         
	The replacement of M.K. Narayanan by Menon as NSA last fortnight hugely strengthened the stymied peaceniks in the PMO, and the will of the Prime Minister himself to extend a hand despite Islamabads failure to deliver on promises.        
	Both the PM and the NSA believe very deeply that talking is more helpful than not talking, said a former diplomat who has interacted with both on Pakistan-related issues. And together they now make a very heavy policy team.        
	It is not entirely insignificant that todays announcement carries a sharp note of caution on where the initiative might lead, clearly laying the ground for possible failure in terms of Indian objectives. Let us not prejudge the outcome of the meeting, it says, keeping expectations low and tempered.        
	 The chief objective at the moment appears to be to break the deadlock and showcase the initiative as New Delhis rather than Pakistans. We can only begin to figure where we can go and what we can achieve once we have opened dialogue, said an advocate of the move in the MEA.         
	Even so, the decision has, quite like the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement, sparked immediate, and bitter, debate. The BJP questioned the wisdom of opening talks when Pakistan had done nothing to address Indias concerns.         
	Terrorism is still a big wall between India and Pakistan and Pakistan has shown no will to do anything about something that disturbs the whole nation, said BJP spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad. We would like to know what has happened suddenly that the government has decided this, what has changed?         
	Former diplomat and commentator G. Parthasarathy sounder a harsher note. I have no quarrel with talks, he said, but what is the governments great hurry to open dialogue? It will only help Pakistan turn the attention to bilateral issues other than terror, because they will do nothing about it. And the timing is particularly idiotic because it amounts to prejudging Chidambarams forthcoming visit. It seems to me the government is not serious about tackling terror.         
	But Salman Haider, a former foreign secretary, unreservedly backed the decision saying: I have no sympathy for those who seek to thwart dialogue, we should look for ways of talking rather than find reasons not to talk. There was a time when conditions were poor and public opinion was stirred but positive developments have taken place and it suggests our larger status as a nation that we have taken the lead in going for talks.        
	Haider said he was recently in Pakistan and sensed a deep and genuine will that our two countries should begin to re-engage.

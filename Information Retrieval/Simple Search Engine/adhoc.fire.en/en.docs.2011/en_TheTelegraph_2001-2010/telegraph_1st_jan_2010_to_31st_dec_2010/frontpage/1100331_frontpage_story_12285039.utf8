          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 30: The Rajiv Gandhi Indian Institute of Management, better known as IIM Shillong, will be holding its first convocation on Saturday.        
	Ashok Dutta, the director of the institute, announced the date for the convocation at a press conference here today.        
	We will have our convocation on April 3. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has consented to be the chief guest for the occasion, he said.        
	Sixty-three students of the two-year flagship post-graduate diploma programme will be given their diplomas and four students will be awarded medals.        
	 The institute will be the first among all the IIMs to webcast its annual convocation ceremony live.        
	We have probably the most tech-savvy campus in the country and we want to take advantage of that and webcast our programme live, said Dutta.        
	The postal department will also release a special cover to mark the occasion, he added.        
	The institute took in its first batch of students in July 2008 and is looking at increasing the number of seats to anything between 90 and 120 this year.        
	The institute will also hike its annual fees for the next academic session.         
	The board of governors will take the decision in April.        
	According to Dutta, IIM Shillongs strength lies in its willingness to experiment with the new.        
	We have connected with other B-schools not through the traditional fests but through golf which we have introduced. We have also started special programmes on hospital management and sports management which are in tune with our mandate to develop the Northeast, the director added.

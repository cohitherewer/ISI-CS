                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Babri pushes back film release 
  - Ranbir versus robot          PRIYANKA ROY                      Priyanka Chopra and Ranbir Kapoor in Anjaana Anjaani                                
	Calcutta, Sept. 20: Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Anjaana Anjaani has skirted the Ramjanmabhoomi verdict date but has crashed into Robot.        
	Anjaana, a road caper starring Ranbir and Priyanka Chopra, has pushed back its release date from this Friday to the next. The temple title suit case is due on September 24, the same Friday that Anjaana was to be released.        
	Anjaana has become the first Bollywood film to voluntarily opt for a postponement.         
	Ranbir, the star attraction of Anjaana, had said last week: I wish the film wouldnt have been releasing on September 24 because (on) that day we need to seek harmony in our country and live with peace. It is really unfortunate that a film is releasing on a day like this when we should not celebrate. If I had my way, I would have postponed it. This comment reportedly set the postponement ball rolling.         
	Priyanka is learnt to have sided with her co-star.        
	The decision was reportedly taken in a closed-door meeting by producers Sajid Nadiadwala and Eros International as well as director Siddharth Anand this morning. We are looking at October 1 as a possible release date but havent arrived at a final decision, an Eros representative told The Telegraph this afternoon. In the evening, it was confirmed that the film would indeed release on October 1, setting up a box-office clash with Robot, starring Rajnikant and Aishwarya Rai.

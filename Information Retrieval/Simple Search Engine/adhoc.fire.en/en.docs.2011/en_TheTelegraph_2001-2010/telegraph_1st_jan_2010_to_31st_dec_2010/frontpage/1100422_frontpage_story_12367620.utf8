The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Modi mails, board deletes
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Modi mails, board deletes
  - Monday meet stands, says Manohar					 					      LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                      
	April 21: Lalit Modis counter-attack has failed: the governing council of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will meet, as scheduled, in Mumbai on April 26.        
	That stands. If some member doesnt wish to attend, what can I do? Except for two subcommittees (finance, Vizzy Trophy), the secretary convenes all meetings. That constitutional position has been followed, Shashank Manohar, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, told The Telegraph.                
	Speaking from Nagpur this evening, shortly before boarding a flight to Mumbai, Manohar added: Nothing is being done improperly and all issues will be settled in the governing council meeting.        
	A top lawyer, Manohar was reacting to the beleaguered IPL chairman and commissioners charge that the meeting was unauthorised and hed stay away if it wasnt, instead, called on May 1.        
	Modi wants time to prepare a point-by-point rebuttal of the allegations flung at him left, right and centre.        
	Till April 25 night, Modi will be busy with IPL III. Then is the presentation of the semi-finalists on a TV network, for the Champions League. He has to prepare for the governing council meeting, said a Modi camp source.        
	In the BCCIs view, the cornered Modi wants to buy time.         
	As things stand, everything points to a massive show of no-confidence against Modi, on April 26. He has started a war, but has no chance of winning it.         
	Asked why hed directed Modi not to reveal the shareholding pattern of all the franchises, after the infamous tweets, Manohar replied: Im glad youve raised this. My explanation is simple  when Modi had kept quiet for 27 months, what was the harm in waiting for another 10-12 days? How did he get this sudden wisdom?        
	Also, dont forget that within hours of Modis tweets on the Kochi franchise (on April 11), Id got an email from co-owner Vivek Venugopal, saying that the confidentiality clause had been breached and that they would consider taking legal action.        
	Having already said that the governing council meeting should be called in 10-12 days, I had to wait. I couldnt risk inviting legal action from any of the other franchises.        
	In my opinion, the issue was complex and clearly had legal implications. It had to be studied and, then, discussed internally. Seven of the 13 remaining members  Arun Jaitley, Rajeev Shukla, Niranjan Shah, Narayanswamy Srinivasan, Sanjay Jagdale, Chirayu Amin and Ravi Shastri agreed promptly. They got the point I was making.                  
	Manohar, whose integrity has never been questioned, accused Modi of leaking confidential matters of the BCCI. In my reply to Modis email (on shareholdings), Id unambiguously written for your eyes only... I mentioned that while marking a CC to the other governing council members.        
	If I may add, Modi replied to my email with Okay, noted. Why has that not been made public? Why has that not been leaked? Surely, the BCCI and I have nothing to hide. However, I definitely want procedures to be followed.        
	Without commenting on Modis future, Manohar actually left little unsaid. Thats typical of him.        
	The Modi leak, to a TV channel this afternoon, appears to be having much the opposite effect. Manohar, after all, isnt alone in being incensed at the suggestion that transparency is being scuttled.        
	Modi stands to lose his position as vice-president of the BCCI and the Champions League post, too.        
	All, mind you, because of indiscreet tweeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Immunity clause for IIM test provider
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Immunity clause for IIM test provider
										      CHARU SUDAN KASTURI       CAT OUT OF BAG                              
	New Delhi, May 15: The IIMs had signed away any right to hold global testing service provider Prometric liable for the technical failures that eventually ravaged their first computerised Common Admission Test, according to documents accessed by The Telegraph.        
	Indias premier business schools forfeited the right seven months before the examination window started end-November, and could not have held Prometric accountable for losses had the CAT been cancelled midway  as it nearly was.         
	Instead, the IIMs themselves may have had to pay for compensation claims made by affected students against Prometric, reveals the contract signed between the institutes and the service provider, titled the master services agreement.        
	The clauses shed light on a possible but undeclared motive for the IIMs to pull back from the brink of cancelling the computerised test and ordering a traditional retest.         
	Several reasons  such as the interests of students who took the test without any glitches and that teething troubles should not be allowed to stand in the way of modernisation  were offered then but at no point was it disclosed that the agreement had virtually tied the hands of the IIMs.        
	Using the Right to Information Act, The Telegraph has accessed the agreement and other confidential documents associated with the selection of Prometric as the service provider to computerise the CAT from last year.        
	The agreement and the statement of work detailing the service providers tasks were signed on April 21, 2009, by directors of the seven IIMs, Prometric managing director Michael Brannick and its Asia-Pacific general manager Ramesh Nava.         
	The contract specifically states that Prometric will not be liable in the event of failure in performance of any of its obligations as a result of any equipment or software malfunction unless the firm itself causes the malfunction.         
	In a separate section, the agreement also states that the IIMs agree to indemnify, defend and hold Prometric and its agents harmless from and against any and all losses arising out of any claim, actions or proceeding... provided that Prometric follows IIMs directions or instructions.         
	The contract adds later: The indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for expenses with respect thereto, including counsel of its choice.        
	Prometric and the IIMs blamed the failures on external virus attacks even though cyber security experts contested these claims and suggested that inadequate preparation appeared a more reasonable explanation. Some exemption clauses  covering war, natural or manmade disasters, civil unrest or acts of God  are routine in such contracts, said experts who have conducted similar exams. The Prometric-IIMs contract protects both parties from liability in these scenarios.         
	But in my experience, the service provider is held accountable for any technical glitches during operations. In fact, the ability to provide glitch-free service is a principal criterion while selecting the service provider, said a senior professor at BITS Pilani, which conducts a computerised entrance examination.         
	Technical snags crippled many test centres on the first few days of the 10-day window  November 28 to December 7  which the IIMs initially set for the computerised CAT last year.         
	Terminals worked at different speeds at different centres, and several students complained that the computerised exam declared itself over while they were still attempting it within the allotted time.         
	Over 8,000 students were adversely affected by these failures, according to the IIMs. Another 2,000 could not appear at their scheduled slot for the test as their centre had to be shut because of complaints from earlier candidates, the institutes said at the time.         
	The faculties of the IIMs in Bangalore and Calcutta passed resolutions seeking the scrapping of the test midway and a traditional pencil-paper retest.        
	Divisions surfaced among IIM directors, and the human resource development ministry summoned the institute heads for an explanation on the examination fiasco.        
	The IIM directors finally decided to continue with the computerised test, rescheduling slots for the affected students.        
	The agreement suggests the IIMs may have had little option but to continue with the computerised CAT. Scrapping the test would have led to financial losses the directors may have found hard to explain. An IIM director, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the institute heads concluded that they could not have held Prometric financially accountable for losses incurred because of scrapping the test.         
	Once the glitches were attributed to external virus attacks, Prometric could seek exemption from any liability arising out of the cancellation of the exam  because it did not cause the malfunction.        
	Instead, the indemnity clause in the contract meant that the IIMs may have had to pay for claims against Prometric because the technical failures were not a result of the service provider violating IIM instructions.         
	Sticking to the computerised examination made sense because under the contract, if retests are to be conducted due to a failure on the part of Prometric, such retests will be performed by Prometric at no additional cost.

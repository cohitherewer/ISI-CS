										      In the new decade, the iPhone, Facebook and the book will have competition. India will try to balance its books and the lsquo;9 per cent rsquo; dream. But nothing will go waste, not even urine                      Illustration by Uday Deb                          
	MANMOHAN rsquo;S MICAWBER CHALLENGE  
	India is the only one among the large emerging market economies to carry the burden of twin deficits  a fiscal deficit and a current account deficit.  
	What this essentially means is that the government spends more than what it earns, and the country pays out more for the goods and services it imports than the money it earns from exports.        
	The weight of these two deficits has tarnished an otherwise spectacular period of growth in the decade that is just drawing to a close  and presents a huge challenge for the policy makers who will have to craft strategies to take the country into the next decade of frenetic growth.        
	Back in 2002, Arvind Virmani, then an adviser with the Planning Commission, had posited that India had moved from a Hindu rate of growth of just over 3 per cent in the sixties and seventies to a Bharatiya rate of growth of 5.8 per cent in the eighties and nineties, largely underpinned by the phenomenal growth in the services sector, which today accounts for almost 65 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).         
	The UPA governments vision is to sustain a 9 per cent plus growth in the next decade  and economists will vie with each other to hang a new label on that achievement, if fulfilled.        
	Among emerging markets, India has a unique characteristic: its the only one whose growth is entirely dependent on domestic demand. But while private consumption is rising  it stood at around 55 per cent of GDP  it isnt really a consumerist economy; there is an innate sense of frugality among Indians that shows up in the high savings rate of well over 37 per cent.        
	The reform initiative        
	The Cassandras  and there are many  believe that a sustained GDP growth of 9 per cent is a pie-in-the-sky dream and that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has often articulated that figure, is playing the role of Micawber, the eternal optimist In Charles Dickenss David Copperfield.        
	But even Micawber knew the value of living within ones means. He enunciated his Micawber principle thus: Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds, nineteen shillings and six pence. Result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds, ought and six pence. Result misery.        
	Its a principle that Manmohan Singhs detractors would like to see him adopt as his government struggles to put a lid on runaway budget and fiscal deficits. To achieve this, he will need to trim subsidies, plug the leaks in disbursals through the massive welfare schemes that helped the UPA storm back to power, and improve transparency and accountability in all forms of government spending.        
	The other big focus will be on reforms: greater deregulation of the financial sector with a proper systemic template to manage risks, aggressive tax reforms, a strong push for privatisation, further relaxation in capital controls, and a shift away from a mindset that demands a heavy hand on the tiller at the first sign of market volatility.        
	Much will depend on the UPA governments ability to deliver on its promises in the first half of the next decade.        
	Growth pangs: Inflation and jobless growth        
	A resurgent economy and the strong capital inflows that this induces will leave Indias monetary authorities with a Hobsons choice: they would have to either suck out liquidity from the system to tamp down on inflation or they would have to allow the rupee to appreciate and make its exports uncompetitive.        
	The other big worry is that economic growth hasnt spurred genuine job creation. One reason for this is the sharp increase in the labour force  that is, the sum of the people who are already working and those who are seeking employment. The labour force grew at 2.93 per cent between 1999-2000 and 2004-05, which was twice the population growth rate.        
	Even though the employment growth rate had risen to 2.89 per cent during the same period, the experts do not expect to reach the inflexion point  where the workforce equals the labour force (and so there is no unemployment)  until the latter half of the next decade.         
	The broad objectives are noble: jobs for all by 2020, 100 per cent literacy, financial inclusion for the poor, proper homes for all, good healthcare, closer integration with the global economy and a country less vulnerable to external security threats.         
	It all sounds too good to be true: but the actions we take in the next decade will determine whether India will emerge as the third-largest economy in the world after China and the US by 2025.

	MORE ADDICTIVE THAN TWITTER  
	If the end of the past decade was ruled by the two networking darlings, Twitter and Facebook, be ready for something even more addictive in the coming one. Since it is becoming increasingly difficult to stay on top of your hundreds of emails and sorting out junk, direct and immediate communication will rule now.  
	Twitter provided the perfect springboard for the launch of Foursquare. You may not even need status messages any longer as Foursquare (www.foursquare.com) lets individuals share their locations with a group of friends. It started out as a mobile application for the iPhone. It is also a virtual game in which participants earn badges for going to various places and those that check in the most become a mayor. Its closest competitor is Google Latitude, but most people here refuse to disclose their location.
  The buzzword of 2009 was cloud computing. Data and applications will cease to reside on your desktop. It is will be hosted on servers (cloud) elsewhere. Even the operating system will reside in the cloud.   
	An early adopter was G.ho.st (Global Hosted Operating System). It is a secure desktop with 15 GB of free file storage. It comes with an Office suite, a word processor, Excel-like spreadsheet and even a presentation tool like PowerPoint. It also has tools for sharing and collaboration.  
	A pretty good collaboration tool that is in a trial mode is Google Wave. You can start a project or wave and share it with a number of people who will contribute to the development of, say, software. You can chat, or hold a videoconference while working together. Next year will also see the launch of Google's Chrome operating system, which will be completely web-based.
  Another eagerly awaited application is face recognition. With Google rsquo;s Android operating system for smartphones, all you will need do is take a picture of a person and upload it to Google and you will instantly get back all the information on the individual provided it is in the Google database of images.
  For students there are stimulating times ahead. You do not have to go to a foreign university to study. Apple rsquo;s iTunes has started providing free lectures under iTunes U by eminent professors on a variety of subjects like business, engineering, fine arts, health and medicine, history, mathematics, science, social science, literature, teaching and education. Download and sync them with your iPod, whether it is a shuffle, nano Touch or iPhone.  
	SURIT DOSS  
	BUSINESS MAY LOSE lsquo;CLASS rsquo;  
	Business will lose the glamour it acquired in the rsquo;80s, say analysts, and so will the B-schools that made the study of business cool, drawing many of the best students. As cushy corporate jobs disappear in the recession, thousands of new MBAs will be asking themselves if the huge education loan was worth it. Employers, with less to offer, will care less and less if the recruit has a posh business degree.  
	The Economist claims this trend will not be a ldquo;little recessionary dip rdquo; but a ldquo;more fundamental reappraisal rdquo;, and welcomes the decline in gobbledegook, verbiage and the number of Smart Alecs it foresees in the corporate world.  
	One reason for business looking less classy and more crass, it believes, will be the rise of unscrupulous cowboy billionaires, quick to spot a loophole in the increasing government regulations (following the recession) and make a killing.
  The poor job market will offer governments a chance to hire the brightest mdash; but does anyone really expect smarter governments?  
	iPHONE GETS A RIVAL  
	Tech titans Google and Apple will be locked in handset-to-handset combat. Google plans to sell its own smartphone mdash; the long-awaited touch-screen Android mdash; early in 2010, probably challenging the iPhone and shaking up the US cellphone market where most phones work only on the networks of the service providers that sold them.
  Google plans to market and sell directly to consumers over the Internet, with buyers able to sign up for service from any compatible provider. It rsquo;s a risky departure for the software giant that has largely avoided selling hardware.   
	The phone rsquo;s success could depend on the price. Most Americans buy phones subsidised by service providers, which recoup that cost by locking customers into contracts. The iPhone that costs a consumer $199 actually costs AT amp;T about $550.
  It isn rsquo;t clear if Google will team up with carriers to sell service plans for the phone, or if it will subsidise the devices hoping to offset the difference with mobile advertising profits. Analysts said Google may target big overseas markets, where unlocked, unsubsidised phones tend to be the norm.  
	Google employees said the device was thinner than the iPhone, with a slightly larger touch screen. It is named Nexus One, according to reports. Google wants to get more people using Web-friendly phones in part because it depends on the growth of search advertising, which is slowing on PCs. On cellphones, however, use of Google rsquo;s mobile search engine grew 30 per cent in six months this year, Schachter said.  
	Based on a New York Times News Service report            
	PRINT? READ PIXELS  
	More and more people, especially the Facebook and Twitter generation, will start reading e-books as prices of e-readers fall. In 2010, e-books are likely to account for only about one in 40 books sold; but over the decade, downloading books will become as much a trend as downloading music and video as book-reading software gets better and better.  
	Models will have colour screens and newer e-readers will allow easy access to blogs and shopping sites. The Eee Reader, from Taiwan's Asus, will have two screens, a hinged spine, a web cam and a microphone for Skype. Industry analysts believe that by the end of the decade, many people will even start e-reading newspapers.
  For now, expect a war between Amazon's Kindle e-book reader, a series of rivals from Sony, and Barnes amp; Noble rsquo;s Nook. If e-books replace textbooks someday, schoolbags will get lighter.  N-REVOLUTION  Not nukes but nitrogen. And if the experiment is successful, says The Economist, it could boost the yield of the planet rsquo;s crops, slash their cost, use less fossil fuel to grow them and cut the pollution from farming, reduce hunger and return some land to the rain forest.  Biosciences companies are testing a gene derived from barley on rice, wheat and other crops. In the experimental plots, the plants often need less than half as much nitrogen to achieve the same yield, or provide 25 per cent more yield for the same nitrogen.
  If half this gain is achieved once commercialised, the magazine says, food would get cheaper and water become cleaner (now the waste nitrogen from soil is washed to lakes, rivers and seas and chokes them by causing dense algal blooms).   Fisheries and natural reserves would revive, and greenhouse emissions will fall by the equivalent of taking all the cars in America, Britain and Germany off the roads. 
    PEE FOR POWER  Empty your tank to fill up your car rsquo;s. Chemists at Ohio University have found that hydrogen is released when you put a specially designed nickel electrode into a pool of urine mdash; the planet rsquo;s most abundant waste mdash; and apply an electrical current.   It rsquo;s far cheaper than producing hydrogen from water and can not only fuel the hydrogen-powered cars of the future but also help clean up the effluent from sewage plants. Converting the urine of one cow can supply hot water for 19 houses.  Urine has more uses, though. The P (phosphorus) in pee is a fertiliser, and the National Trust of Britain has asked men to urinate on their compost heaps to help their gardening and save on flushing the lavatory.

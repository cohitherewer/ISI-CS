The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Snarls brew on Bypass 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Snarls brew on Bypass 
          KINSUK BASU                            Traffic flow could be disrupted around the busy Parama island once a part of the EM Bypass is blocked to build an elevated road. A Telegraph picture                                   
	Work on the proposed elevated road over Parama island could soon reduce the EM Bypass traffic to a crawl with the builder planning to block portions of the zip-zap-zoom stretch.        
	According to the plan, about a lane and a half on each flank of the Bypass on both sides of the rotary will be made out of bounds for traffic so that piling can be done for the flyover linking the Park Circus intersection with the artery.        
	The fences would extend 900m to the north of the rotary, till near the Dhapa dumping ground. In the south, about 500m would be fenced off.         
	Constriction of the Bypass would lead to severe traffic congestion, feel cops.         
	Commuters might have to put up with traffic congestion, particularly during peak hours. The portion of the road we would need would be less than the area fenced off for the East-West Metro project, said a senior official of the CMDA.         
	The government agency has appointed HCC, which built the Bandra-Worli sea-link in Mumbai, to execute the Rs 317.92-crore project.         
	Work on the elevated road started in February with engineers carrying out soil tests. The second phase is erecting the pillars, from 39 metres below the ground level.        
	The CMDA and the company both want to start the piling work without delay, even if they have to ignore the wishes of police.         
	We asked the CMDA not to fence off parts of the Bypass till the service road that stretches south from in front of ITC The Sonar Calcutta is ready to share the traffic load, said Ranvir Kumar, the special additional commissioner of police (traffic).        
	There could be some problems during construction of the elevated road but development work cannot be stopped, Kumar added.         
	CMDA officials said the agency could not wait for work on the service road to be completed before starting the piling work.        
	The service road would be ready in due course. For us, the priority is to get the piling work started, said an official.         
	The HCC top brass want the piling to start before the monsoon arrives. The work would take months.        
	We are supposed to complete the project within 30 months of its commencement but we want to ensure that the work is finished well ahead of schedule, Vinayak Deshpande, the president and chief operating officer of HCC, told Metro.        
	It is a challenge to build an elevated road in a congested part of the city. We have complete faith in the state administration and so far the going has been great, he added.         
	More than 50,000 vehicles cross Parama island between 8am and 8pm on a weekday. Congestion at the crossing will have a ripple effect along both the EM Bypass and the Park Circus connector, said a senior traffic officer.

  - Mukherjee has tried to win hearts but the price prick may puncture the mood        OUR BUREAU                                                    
	New Delhi, Feb. 26:From balloon boy to rocket scientist, Pranab Mukherjee made most people happy today with a budget that cut income tax, though mothers with small  or large  children would have flashed sweeter smiles if he had held out hope for cheaper sugar.         
	The finance minister rolled back stimulus measures announced in the wake of the slowdown by putting excise duty back at 10 per cent across the board and coupled it with higher levies on petroleum products, fanning price worries.        
	Industry greeted the budget as positive, having expected the stimulants to be withdrawn with growth picking up. There was a grumble about the minimum alternate tax, which companies that do not pay a levy on profits have to bear, being raised from 15 to 18 per cent. But the cut in corporate surcharge from 10 to 7.5 per cent brought the grins back.                  
	V. Srinivasan, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, said: Growth will continue with this budget.         
	Although Mukherjee intended the waiver of central excise on toy balloons that are a source of joy to millions of children to bring a smile to their mothers faces, it was the stock market that whooshed like a rocket.        
	The Bombay Stock Exchange index  the sensex  shot up by 420 points but ended the day closer to Earth with a gain of 175.35 points or 1.08 per cent over its last close.        
	Economists experiencing fiscal nightmares for the past year over the governments ballooning deficit  the gap between income and expenditure  were happy to see the finance minister return to the path of prudence.        
	The fiscal deficit as a percentage of the GDP has narrowed to 6.9 per cent (including oil and fertiliser bonds) in the current year, down from 7.8 per cent in 2008-09. For the coming year the projection is 5.5 per cent.         
	By giving some away in income tax and taking more by way of excise and customs duty and service tax, the minister expects to collect an additional revenue of Rs 20,500 crore.        
	Mukherjee earned a pat on the back from the Prime Minister for a job well done.        
	The Opposition, however, showed him their combined back by walking out of the House in protest against the higher duties that are raising petrol and diesel prices by over Rs 2.50.         
	A walkout has probably never taken place in the past during the budget speech. The Opposition parties, ranging from the BJP to the Left, as well as outside supporters of the Congress-led government marched out in a rare show of unity.        
	Samajwadi leader Mulayam Singh appealed to the people at an impromptu news conference, with a galaxy of Opposition veterans by his side, to hit the streets as they had done during the Emergency.        
	The entire Opposition is together, said RJD leader Lalu Prasad, who, less ominously, also pronounced his verdict on Mukherjee and railway minister Mamata Banerjee. Dada and Didi have failed the people, Lalu Prasad said. Both are concerned only about Bengal.        
	It was a response to Mukherjee announcing, with the hint of a smile that anticipated the boos from the Opposition, the inclusion of some Bengal districts in a central flood control programme.        
	Mukherjee conceded the price point. It (the budget) will be inflationary to some extent. (I am) told by the economic division (of the finance ministry) that the impact will be 0.41 per cent on WPI (wholesale price index). There may be some cascading effect, he told NDTV about the impact of higher petroleum taxes.        
	Common people buffeted by rising prices will share with the Opposition the concern over inflationary forces getting a new head of steam but may find solace in a softer tax blow.         
	Under the new tax slabs, income between Rs 1.6 lakh and Rs 5 lakh will be charged at 10 per cent, between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 8 lakh at 20 per cent and beyond Rs 8 lakh at 30 per cent.        
	Investment up to Rs 20,000 in long-term infrastructure bonds will be eligible for deduction from taxable income, adding to the Rs 1 lakh that is already allowed.        
	Besides higher petroleum prices, the consumer will have to pay more for a wide range of goods because of the rollback of the excise duty cut.         
	 Car companies were quick to step on the price accelerator. Television sets, air conditioners and cement will also cost more as will air travel.        
	If Mukherjee expected cheaper balloons to bring smiles to young mothers faces, he should have thought twice before slapping a 10 per cent excise on diapers.         
	Mothers nursing ambitions to turn their children into space travellers can, however, rejoice. The Indian Space Research Organisation gets Rs 150 crore to send a two-member crew into space and get them back home safely.

  - Brown to quit but not now          AMIT ROY                            Brown (top) and Clegg. (AP and Reuters)                                       
	London, May 10: Just when David Cameron seemed on the point of moving into 10 Downing Street with Liberal Democratic support, Gordon Brown dramatically announced he would resign so that Nick Clegg could try and form a coalition government with the Labour Party under a more palatable leader.        
	Brown said he would go but not just yet.        
	He intends staying on as caretaker Prime Minister to oversee the process of forming a possible coalition with the Lib Dems but would be gone by the time of the Labour Party conference in September.        
	It is suspected that Brown and Clegg cannot stand one another. Clegg and Conservative leader Cameron, both young men with young families, are said to get on.        
	The Lib Dems, who have been carrying on protracted negotiations with the Tories, say they will continue these point-by-point discussions while opening substantive talks with Labour as well. After Browns statement, the Conservatives made the final offer to the Lib Dems: a referendum on an alternative electoral system.        
	With the result from one safe Tory seat yet to come, Cameron will be able to command 307 seats but he needs 326 for an absolute majority.        
	Labour with 258 seats and the Lib Dems with 57 get up to 315, so this coalition will still need the support of 11 Independents.        
	Clegg now finds himself in the position of the not entirely virginal bride who cannot make up her mind whether she should marry the older, more established man who has already fathered several good-for-nothing children by his first wife or the handsome young college student who shows promise but hasnt got a proper job as yet.        
	Life would be wonderful if she could sleep with both but poor Clegg is being pulled in opposite directions by sections of his own party.        
	 Brown emerged from Downing Street at 5 this evening with the gathered media expecting a dignified I quit statement. But he is obviously not the man to go gentle into that good night.        
	Instead, as his statement made clear, he was much more prepared to rage, rage against the dying of the light  or, at least, any prospect of Cameron moving into the residence he considered to be his.                    David Cameron      
	Mr Clegg has just informed me that while he intends to continue his dialogue that he has begun with the Conservatives, he now wishes also to take forward formal discussions with the Labour Party, began Brown.   
	 I believe it is sensible and its in the national interest to respond positively, he went on.         
	Brown kept the best till the end.        
	The reason that we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country, he acknowledged. As leader of my party, I must accept that as a judgment on me. I, therefore, intend to ask the Labour Party to set in train the processes needed for its own leadership election. I would hope that it would be completed in time for the new leader to be in post by the time of the Labour Party conference. I will play no part in that contest, I will back no individual candidate.        
	There is no guarantee that the Labour-Lib Dem talks will lead to marriage.        
	There will be popular anger at Clegg if he is seen to be propping up a party that has lost. On the other hand, Brown is promising immediate legislation and a referendum leading to a proportional system in elections  something the Lib Dems desperately want and which the Tories were resisting.         
	A Lab-Lib Dem part would be dubbed a coalition of the losers.        
	Brown was not elected by the country at large as Prime Minister. Neither will be the new Labour leader if he does become Prime Minister. That could be the foreign secretary David Miliband, the childrens minister, Ed Balls, or a stop-gap in the shape of the home secretary Alan Johnson  or a dark horse.

          VIVEK CHHETRI                             Hillary amp; Tenzing: 57 years and still an inspiration                                 
	Darjeeling, Oct. 3: Jamling Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Peter Hillary today marched with the New Zealand contingent to inspire athletes at the Commonwealth Games.         
	The march was to keep alive the spirit of what their fathers  Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary  had achieved 57 years ago: scaled Mt Everest for the first time on May 29, 1953. Hillary, a beekeeper from New Zealand, and Tenzing, a porter from Indias Darjeeling, had little in common then except the team spirit.         
	The New Zealand Olympic Committee decided to pay tribute to this spirit by naming the countrys Commonwealth Games logo 29028 Hillary and Tenzing. The 29028 in the logo stands for the height of Mt Everest in feet.         
	While travelling from the Games village to the stadium today, Jamling told The Telegraph over the phone: I, along with Peter, met the team athletics here yesterday. We offered them khadas (traditional Tibetan scarves) to wish them luck. Both of us will be marching with the team reminding them of the inspiration that helped our fathers achieve what was thought to be unachievable at that time.        
	The Kiwi team led by Irene van Dyk wore the khadas, as Jamling said they would, while he along with fellow Everester Peter, and New Zealand chef de mission Dave Currie, brought in the rear.         
	We both are representing our respective families at the Games. It is a huge honourI told the team After six attempts, six failures, my father kept going. He never gave up, said Jamling.        
	The team believes that the presence of Jamling and Peter will help them achieve much. The committees web page reads: On the 29th of May 1953 Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the first to reach the summit of Mt Everest after climbing 29028 feet of rock, snow and ice. Now, in memory of Sir Edmund and Tenzing, 29028 has become the motivation and inspiration for this years Commonwealth GamesLets get behind our team and come together to honour Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay.

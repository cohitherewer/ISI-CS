The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bond, even before Buddhism
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bond, even before Buddhism
          NALIN VERMA                            Foreign devotees listen to a lecture by the Dalai Lama in Bodh Gaya on Thursday. (AFP)                                  
	Bodh Gaya, Jan. 7: For the villagers of Bakaraul, Buddha is their bhagwan. But ask if they had been to hear the Dalai Lamas world peace lectures barely a kilometre away, none would say yes.        
	Yet, nearly every bride and groom in Bakaraul go to the Mahabodhi temple in Bodh Gaya after marriage, though not a single villager is a Buddhist.        
	Its not that the villagers of Bakaraul dislike the Dalai Lama, whose lectures have drawn some 30,000 people from across the world. They revere him, but they dont feel the need to listen to him. After all, their bond with the Buddha goes back 2,500 years, long before the spread of Buddhism.        
	According to legend, one of their ancestors, Sujata, broke Siddharth Gautamas 12-year penance by offering kheer, a preparation made of milk and rice.        
	The government has named Bakaraul Sujata Nagar, but to the 3,300-odd villagers its still Bakaraul.         
	Like they worship bhagwan Buddha, they have also been praying to Goddess Sujata, and for a long, long time. Names, whether its Bakaraul or Sujata Nagar, dont really matter.         
	Its the same logic that has kept them away from the Dalai Lamas lecture that entered its third day today.        
	We revere him (the Dalai Lama). But we worship the Buddha in the way our sanatan dharma asks us to. We dont feel like taking lessons from the Dalai Lama for worshipping the Buddha, said Triveni Mahto, 75.        
	We are Hindus who believe in sanatan dharma. And the Buddha is the ninth incarnation of Vishnu. We worship him, added Jagat Kishore Prasad, 65, pointing a finger in the direction of a Vishnu temple 8km from the village.        
	But young couples go to the Mahabodhi temple for his blessings.         
	Recently, I got married and my wife and I went to the Buddha temple together to get his blessings, said Pawan Kumar, a postgraduate student of Magadh University, Bodh Gaya.        
	At a high philosophical level, there might be some subtle differences between what the Upanishads and the Buddha preached, explained Sonam Dorjee, an advocate from Ladakh. But at the popular level it is almost the same. The Upanishads and the Vedas too describe worldly attachment as illusion.        
	It explains why the women of Bakaraul offer flowers and vermilion in the stupa where their Sujata Ma is believed to have lived.         
	This faith that goes beyond religions has also made the villagers suspicious of the move to free the management of the Mahabodhi temple from Hindu control.        
	Some Buddhist monks are on a hunger strike in their battle for liberation of the shrine but the local people find the move politically motivated and aimed at getting benefits minorities are entitled to. Even the Dalai Lama has not heeded the monks demand.        
	At Bodh Gaya today, the spiritual leader asked China not to look at a temporary solution for the Tibetan problem.        
	They should use measures which can lead to a permanent solution of the problem, the 74-year-old said, a day after he had thanked China for accepting Buddhism.        
	I do not want to make any political statement, he said but made it clear that the use of temporary measures by China would eventually aggravate the problem more rather than solving it.

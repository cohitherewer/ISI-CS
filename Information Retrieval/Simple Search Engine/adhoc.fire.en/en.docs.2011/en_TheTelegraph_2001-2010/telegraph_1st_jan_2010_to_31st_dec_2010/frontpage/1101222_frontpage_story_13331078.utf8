          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                             Okram Iboboi Singh, P. Chidambaram                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: Home minister P. Chidambaram today set deadlines for long-pending infrastructure projects in Manipur during a meeting with chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh.         
	There was enough reason for Chidambaram to step in as it was the ministry of home affairs that had moved the cabinet to sanction Rs 392 crore to repair the dilapidated National Highway 53 (Imphal-Jiribam-Silchar) as an alternative to NH 39 (Imphal-Dimapur) that was frequently hit by blockades, choking supply of essentials to the land-locked state. The fresh deadline for completing the long-pending project is 2013.         
	The respective ministries have been informed of the decisions on which the Manipur government is expected to coordinate.         
	Another project is the Jiribam-Imphal railway line, which was scheduled to be finished by 2012 but is now unlikely to be completed before 2016. The Jiribam-Tupul railway track, that was to be completed by 2012, will be finished in 2014 while the other stretch will take another two years.         
	Sources said the state government was not able to surmount the hurdles of law and order and land acquisition in time, resulting in the delay.         
	Chidambaram also asked the Ibobi Singh government to monitor supply of essentials to the state. Imphal valley is still reeling from the recent blockades on its arteries that hit supply of goods, especially foodgrains and petroleum products.         
	We have rice stocks for just one day although supplies reach every day, a source said.         
	NH 53 has become important for Manipur as dependability on NH 39 has been shaky since early this year. Blockades have been put up on the road to protest against holding of autonomous council polls in the hill districts, firing at Mao gate and the state governments refusal to allow NSCN (Isak-Muivah) leader Thuingalang Muivah to visit his ancestral home in Manipur. Subsequently, repairs on NH 53 were stepped up.         
	Truckers have also refused to ply on NH 39 in protest against extortion by militant groups. Government sources, however, said this was an excuse by vested interests to jack up transport rates.         
	Extortion is not a new thing. By saying this, truckers are finding it convenient to increase their rates, an official said.

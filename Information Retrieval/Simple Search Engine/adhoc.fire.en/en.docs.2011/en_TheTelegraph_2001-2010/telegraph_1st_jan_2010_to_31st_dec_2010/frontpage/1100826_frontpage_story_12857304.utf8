The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Blockade sparks Tirap fuel crisis
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Blockade sparks Tirap fuel crisis
          PULLOCK DUTTA                                    
	Guwahati, Aug. 25: A severe fuel crisis is plaguing Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh in the wake of an economic blockade in Assam against the neighbouring state, with the authorities banning sale of fuel in the district from today.         
	Several organisations, including the AASU and AJYCP, launched an economic blockade against Arunachal Pradesh since Sunday following attacks on Assamese villagers by allegedly by NSCN-IM militants and civilians backed by the rebels, from the neighbouring state.         
	Two routes  the Naharkatia-Joypur road in Dibrugarh district and Charaipung-Longding road  have been blocked. The routes are considered lifelines for Tirap with all essential commodities to the district supplied from Assam through them.         
	Till yesterday, we allowed five litres of petrol per private vehicle and 10 litres for trucks and buses. But that has been stopped from today, deputy commissioner (in-charge) of Tirap, T. Aran told The Telegraph over phone.         
	There is only a single petrol pump in the land-locked district in the eastern corner of the country bordering Myanmar and the entire supply of fuel is ferried from Assam through the Naharkatia-Joypur route.         
	We require at least one tanker of petrol and a tanker of diesel in two-three days, but that has not come for the last six days, Aran said.         
	The flare-up started on August 14 with militants and people from Arunachal Pradesh damaging a half-constructed building of Charaipung police station in Sivasagar district and it continued for the next few days, forcing the AASU and AJYCP to take the drastic step.         
	Aran said the district would also face a food crisis in the next few days if the supply of essentials was not restored. We have sent an SOS to the chief secretary to take up the matter with his Assam counterpart so that the blockade is lifted immediately, he said.         
	The deputy commissioner said he has received information from Itanagar today that at least two tankers will arrive in the district within the next couple of days with army escorts. We are keeping our fingers crossed for the fuel to arrive, he said.         
	Aran said it was not right on the part of the AASU and other organisations in Assam to resort to such a move by holding the people of Tirap to ransom. The border issue should be solved at the government level. Why should the people suffer? he asked.         
	He said NSCN (I-M) militants were not involved in the recent incidents, as claimed by Assam. The land at Charaipung belongs to us and Assam has no right to occupy our land, the DC added.

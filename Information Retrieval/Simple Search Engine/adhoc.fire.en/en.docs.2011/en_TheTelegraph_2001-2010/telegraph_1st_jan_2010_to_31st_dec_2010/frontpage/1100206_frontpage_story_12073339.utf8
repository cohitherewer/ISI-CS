  - 60 students to begin with, classes start in June-July        AMIT GUPTA                                    
	Ranchi, Feb. 5: The new IIM coming up at Ranchi promises to stand by the high academic standards set by the countrys best brand in management education, but course fees will be lower.        
	Unveiling plans for the new IIM in Ranchi, R.C. Bhargava, the chairman of the board of governors constituted to run it, said the fee structure had been kept on the lower side as the institute would be making its debut this year.         
	Classes would begin sometime in June-July, added Bhargava, the chairman of Maruti Suzuki India Limited, before outlining the fee structure.        
	For common admission test (CAT) aspirants who appeared for the exam in December 2009, the fee for a two-year post graduate diploma in management (PGDM) would be Rs 6 lakh in Ranchi.        
	While IIM, Ahmedabad, charges Rs 12.5 lakh for the two-year course, at IIM, Calcutta  the mentor institute for Ranchi  the diploma costs Rs 9 lakh. It is Rs 11 lakh at Bangalore (Rs 5.25 lakh in the first year, Rs 5.75 lakh in second year), and Rs 8 lakh at IIM, Lucknow.         
	Bhargava said IIM, Ranchi, would admit 60 students to begin with. Administrative Training Institute (ATI) hostels would be used by the students temporarily.         
	CAT aspirants who appeared in the December 2009 tests for admission in 2010-12 batches would be eligible for admission here. We would entertain only those who secure above 95 percentile in CAT, Bhargava said, adding that a separate advertisement for admissions to IIM, Ranchi, (only for CAT 2009 aspirants) would be published by the end of this month.         
	Bhargava revealed the institute would be roping in banks to provide educational loans to prospective students of IIM, Ranchi, like at other IIMs. Studies would be at par with the other IIMs of the country, he insisted. IIM, Calcutta will be providing faculty, syllabi, etc for the new institute in Jharkhand, he told the media at Suchana Bhavan, located beside Raj Bhavan on posh Kanke Road, that would house the institute during the initial months.        
	The new IIM would be hooked up with its mentor institute in Calcutta via video-conferencing. This means that any PGDM lecture at Joka can be made use of, that too live, by Ranchi IMM students.        
	IIM, Calcutta, director Shekhar Choudhary, who was present during todays deliberations, told The Telegraph that the Union ministry of human resource development was working on appointing a director for IIM, Ranchi.         
	The board of governors, of which Bhargava has been named chairman, was expected to be constituted by the Centre within the next month. As per existing norms, the board would have 24 to 26 members.         
	However, an IIM review committee set up by Union ministry of human resources had recommended that the number be reduced to anything in between 12 and 14 members, added Bhargava.         
	In the near future, IIM, Ranchi, could be shifted (again temporarily) to some of the administrative buildings at the National Games Complex in Hotwar since it was big enough to accommodate the institution along with students and faculty.        
	A permamanent campus is set to come up at Nagri, around 20km from Ranchi.

	According to police sources, relatives of the girl attacked the couple's house in village Brahmiwal in Tarn Taran district late last night. They were angry over the marriage of the girl Gurleen Kaur (19) and the boy Amarpreet Singh (25) against their wishes							   
	In a fit of rage, they opened fire killing the girl and her mother-in-law and seriously injuring the boy. While, the girl and mother-in-law Kuljit Kaur (50) died on the spot the groom, who fought the attackers ran away with serious gunshot injuries, said the police.							   
	He is still struggling for life in a private hospital in Amritsar. At the time of attack grandparents of the boy were also at home but attackers spared them and went out. The father of the boy escaped luckily, since at the time of attack he was not at home, performing duty at Ferozepur district in Railway Police. The attackers included father, brothers and uncles of the girl, the police said adding they were hostile to the marriage.							   
	When police visited the scene they found the body of the bride lying naked with deep cuts in her neck. Even her shoulder and fingers were chopped off and body of her mother-in-law was found in a pool of blood with sharp and deep wounds on her eyes as attempt was made to extract her eyes.  
	 According to police, the couple had an affair before marriage for the last three years and things came to light when the girl eloped with the boy last year. But, later the girl came back to her parental home when her father agreed to marry her with Amarpreet and marriage was solemnised two months ago.  
	 But, meanwhile parents of the girl were nourishing grudge and last night they took revenge when they killed the girl and her mother-in-law but the boy escaped. Police said that so far none of the accused was arrested.

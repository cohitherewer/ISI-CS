The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Controversy in IPL-share                                                                                                                                                    1                                                                                Controversy in IPL-share                                           
	Mumbai , Apr 26 (PTI): Asked about the charges levelled against Modi, Manohar said the charges basically relate to the initial bid of Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab, allegations relating to broadcasting deal, bid rigging of two new franchises (Kochi and Pune), internet rights and behaviorial pattern.  
	About the KXIP shares owned by Preity Zinta, Manohar said that the Bollywood star bid successfully for Mohali as a sole bidder with the promise she would form a consortium but when the agreement was signed she did not have a single share in the franchisee.  
	When the bids were given, it was signed only by Preity Zinta. She said she will form a consortium with three people Mohit Burman, one Mr (Karan) Paul and one other name. When the franchise agreement was signed by her, she did not have a single share in that company. The shares were transferred to her after signing of the agreement, the Board President said.        
	There is a company called Tresco and Blue Water... nobody knows what is Blue Water and what is Tresco and all these things. I did not find in the shareholders register, the name of Raj Kundra or Shilpa Shetty who claim to be the stakeholders, Manohar said        
	He also referred to registration of a company in Britain four months after which its bid was accepted. The company Emerging Media is a co-owner of the Rajasthan Royals. We are asking Modi, how can he sign an agreement with A when the bid came from B. Modi made a statement that the entire world knows who the shareholders are but the fact is that not even the Governing Council members know about Rajasthan Royals. I did not find the names of Shilpa Shetty and Raj Kundra in the papers and they claim to be stakeholders, he revealed.        
	Manohar said many important documents were missing from the IPL and BCCI offices.        
	Many documents are missing from the IPL and BCCI offices. Income Tax department has been asking for them but we dont have them. Like the papers of the broadcast deal with Sony are not with us. IT department is asking for these documents but we cant give them because they are not with us, Manohar said.        
	For all the allegations against Modi, Manohar said if he manages to convince the Board of his innocence in his reply, the inquiry proceedings against him would be dropped.        
	It is the duty of the Board to look into the allegations and to have an inquiry it is important to suspend the person concerned. Its not punishment. The person has to be kept out of the Boards functioning to ensure a free and fair inquiry.        
	The Board would hold an inquiry and if Modis reply convinces the members, proceedings would be dropped, he said.        
	Asked whether the Board was worried about Modis threats of exposing other BCCI office-bearers, Manohar said there was no concern.        
	On whether he would share the blame for the scandal, Manohar said the whole system worked on faith and he could not be held responsible for entrusting Modi with the job.        
	When I dont have the documents about the benami funds in Rajasthan Royals, how can I say anything? If the funds come from say Virgin Island or Mauritius, I dont have the documents to probe. In fact I got to know of all this only after getting the Income Tax notices, he added.

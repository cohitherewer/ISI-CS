  - Buddha sees no early power respite; meeting today         DEVADEEP PUROHIT                                                  
	Calcutta, April 11: Bengal will have to suffer power cuts for another month, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said today.        
	We understand peoples inconvenience but they have to bear it for another one month as the shortage is likely to continue because of halt in production in power units at Bakreswar and Kolaghat, Bhattacharjee told a public meeting in Malda.         
	The chief minister did not forget to cite the dearth of mangoes at roadside orchards in Malda as a sign of the severity of this summer.        
	However, for Bhattacharjees wishes to bear fruit and Bengal to suffer less, his administration put many of its eggs in Mamata Banerjees basket.        
	A long litany of woes awaits Mamatas railway officials when they meet state power minister Nirupam Sen tomorrow for an unfortunately labelled high-powered meeting at Writers Buildings.        
	Sen has convened the meeting with Partha Bhattacharyya, the chairman of Coal India, and V.N. Tripathi and A.P. Sharma, general managers of the Eastern and the South Eastern railways, respectively, to find a solution to an alleged fuel shortage at power plants.        
	Railway minister Mamata today said her department had set aside enough rakes to ferry coal from mines to power plants in Bengal.         
	The agenda notes for tomorrows meeting indicate the government is focusing on toning up coal supply from Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) by stepping up availability of rakes from the railways.        
	According to official data, the five WBPDCL (West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd) plants  with a combined generation capacity of 3,000MW from an installed capacity of 3,850MW  were generating around 2,600MW in the past few days.         
	Power generation has been affected as we were receiving 10 to 11 rakes of coal in place of our daily requirement of 15, a state official said.         
	The agenda notes suggest the government wants to focus on inadequate rail network to the plants, shortage of diesel locomotives that leads to track congestion and non-availability of rakes.        
	We have figures to prove that we have met the target. But in case they need more rakes, we can provide that as well, said a railway official. Congestion is a decade-old problem. That has never come in the way of coal supply, the official added.         
	Balancing such conflicting claims will be a tall order for Sen. He will also have to answer questions on the performance of the WBPDCL, which has blamed both quality and quantity of coal from ECL.         
	 The WBPDCL was reluctant to lift coal from the Mahanadi mines till November last year, said an ECL official, hinting at payment issues with the utility. Later, by the time the WBPDCL made up its mind, the seasonal pressure of rise in demand for imports in the last quarter of the financial year had set in.        
	The official said Indian coal has high ash content and many power stations get the raw coal washed on their own or at private washeries. The PDCL can go in for washed coal but it will cost more, he added.         
	The chief ministers one-month window appears largely based on assumptions that demand from farming will go down by then and hydel plants can function better. But the government will have to plan ahead to avoid a similar shortfall next summer, said a power department official.         
	No planning was done for this summer when the peak-hour demand in the state galloped to 5,800MW from 5,100MW last April.        
	Next April, along with the elements, the hottest political summer will also be at play in the shape of Assembly elections.        
	With inputs from Srikumar Bandopadhyay, Sanjay Mandal and Meghdeep Bhattacharyya

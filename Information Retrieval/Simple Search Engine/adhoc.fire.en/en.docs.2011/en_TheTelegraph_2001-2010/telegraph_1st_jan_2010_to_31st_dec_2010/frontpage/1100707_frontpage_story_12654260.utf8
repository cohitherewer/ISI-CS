  - Full monsoon claim   contested by scientists					 					      G.S. Mudur                                     
	New Delhi, July 6: The India Meteorological Department has declared that the monsoon has advanced over the entire country but senior weather scientists have said the IMD has tweaked its own forecasting rules to avoid waiting any longer.        
	The IMD announcements of the monsoon covering the northwest on Monday and western Rajasthan today follow widespread rainfall over the past 24 to 48 hours that has drenched Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand.        
	But senior weather scientists have questioned the IMD decision to declare the monsoons arrival over the northwest on Monday. The scientists, who requested anonymity for fear of antagonising their own colleagues, have said the IMD appears to have overlooked the need for spatial continuity in rainfall before declaring the monsoons advance over new territories.        
	Sure, it is raining in the northwest, said one scientist. But if we take into account our forecasting rulebook, technically, we cant declare the monsoon has arrived over the northwest, the scientist told The Telegraph.        
	A sizeable chunk of land in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar still appears to lie outside the monsoon zone. The IMD itself conceded yesterday that the monsoon over eastern Uttar Pradesh has been feeble.        
	Weather forecasts also suggest that the northwest is heading for several days of largely dry weather from July 8. Had the IMD not declared the monsoon over the northwest on Monday, the scientists said, it may not have had another opportunity to do so until July 14.        
	It was a tricky situation -- it was now or after July 14, one scientist said.        
	But the head of the IMD said the declaration of the monsoon over the northwest was justified and based on rainfall and atmospheric features. Were seeing typical monsoon rainfall -- it is well-distributed, it is persistent, and we have the right wind flow, said Ajit Tyagi, the director general of the IMD told The Telegraph.        
	But the critics say a history of the monsoon would show that a declaration of the monsoon over the northwest is inconsistent with a large dry zone in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.        
	After its onset over Kerala, the monsoon moves northward to about 20 N latitude. Its advance into Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and the northwest is driven by a low pressure system pushed west-northwestward by easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal.         
	The rainfall in the northwest over the past 24 hours has resulted from an interaction between an atmospheric circulation pattern called a western disturbance and a low pressure system that hung over western Madhya Pradesh.         
	Rainfall data for June shows that 31 of 41 districts in eastern Uttar Pradesh had scanty (60 per cent below normal) or no rainfall, while the other 10 had deficient rainfall (20 per cent below normal). In western Uttar Pradesh, 28 out of 30 districts had scanty or no rainfall.        
	Even todays rainfall chart shows that only three sites in Bihar and two in Uttar Pradesh had received up to 1 cm of rain.        
	The monsoon cant jump 10 degrees (over UP and Bihar) to move northwest, one scientist said, although he added the rainfall in the northwest would make this appear a technical debate. Is the IMD there to make people feel good or tell the truth?        
	But Tyagi said it is simplistic to assume that the monsoon would advance in a specific pre-determined path. We have strong easterly winds over Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, but not enough convergence (the right patterns) for rainfall.        
	Forecasts suggest that the entire northern plains are likely to experience dry winds called northwesterlies from July 8 onwards for a few days. These winds counter moisture-laden easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal and depress rainfall.         
	The IMD release issued this evening predicts fairly widespread rainfall over the northwest for the next 48 hours -- and then a decrease. It also predicts an increase in rainfall over Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, northern Bengal and the northeast by July 11.         
	Meteorologists say the monsoons arrival dates over specific regions have no correlation with rainfall behaviour during the season. The IMD has predicted that July and August will have near normal rainfall, but September will be much wetter than the earlier two months. The forecast for the season has predicted near-normal 102 per cent rainfall.

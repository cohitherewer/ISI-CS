          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 28: State Congress chief Manas Bhuniya today fractured a rib, falling victim to fan frenzy  a phenomenon not many Bengal party leaders are used to.         
	Bhuniya, who has energised the rank and file after taking over the state unit, fell on an iron barricade at Calcutta airport and suffered the minor fracture after being mobbed by supporters.        
	He returned this evening from Delhi where he was formally named Bengal Congress chief by party president Sonia Gandhi.        
	The Congress leader, whose plane landed at Calcutta airport at 5.30pm, was welcomed by around 7,000 supporters and party workers chanting Manas Bhuniya zindabad after he emerged from the VIP gate.        
	Thousands of Congress supporters were waiting for me at the airport. As soon as I came out through the VIP gate and started walking towards the parking lot, they rushed towards me. They surrounded me and started jostling to come closer. In the melee, I fell down and suffered an injury in the left side of my chest, said Bhuniya, a doctor.        
	A state Congress leader said the party leaders present at the airport tried to control the crowd but failed. We could not manage the huge crowd of supporters, all of whom wanted to catch a glimpse of Manas Bhuniya, a Congress leader said.         
	A section of Congress leaders said that had some of the supporters fallen on Bhuniya, in his late 50s, as he fell on the barricade, the injury could have been more serious.         
	We had a tough time taking our leader (Bhuniya) out of the crowd and into his car, another state Congress leader said.         
	Bhuniya then went to a private hospital off EM Bypass to pay a visit to ailing Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim. After meeting Halim, he saw a doctor at the same hospital who prescribed an X-ray.         
	The X-ray report says that I have suffered a minor linear hairline fracture on the sixth rib on the left side. Doctors have told me not to worry and that it will heal with time, Bhuniya said. I am perfectly fine.        
	City-based orthopaedic surgeon Sunil Thakur said that at Bhuniyas age, the injury could take a month to heal.        
	Had there been a major fracture in the ribcage, the bone/bones could have exerted pressure on the lungs. But in the case of a hairline fracture, there is normally no such risk. But he (Bhuniya) will have to be careful. He should not turn on the left side while sleeping. He should not pick up heavy objects or exert himself, Thakur said.         
	Bhuniya said Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, K. Keshava Rao, had called him up from Delhi and wished him speedy recovery.        
	Later in the evening, Bhuniya spoke to some reporters at the PCC office off Lalmohan Bhattacharya Street. I met Rahul Gandhi during my trip to the capital and requested him to come to Bengal in November. The state Congress will hold a peace rally in Lalgarh on November 10, he said.

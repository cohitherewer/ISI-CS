The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Delhi does look better with a global gloss
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Delhi does look better with a global gloss
          SUJAN DUTTA                                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: The lights of Nehru Place reflect in the Yamuna, ringing its right bank with streaks of saffron and mercury that pierce the dark waters. From the top of the new Noida Link flyover that opened just three days back, this is a view of Delhi never seen before.        
	The right bank of the river that runs through Delhi shines brightly in the clear evenings this autumn of the Commonwealth Games. The scene and the reflection in the river tell many tales:        
	This flyover is new; opened only day before yesterday, the nearly 2km long overpass was completed at record speed so that CWG cyclists could be transported easily to the Taj (Noida-Greater Noida) Expressway for their event.        
	Heavy rain  the heaviest in 30 years  has meant that the Yamuna contains within its banks more water than it has held in three decades; it has swept away villages, turned villagers homeless and flooded the farmlands; it is breeding mosquitoes that infect with dengue and it is letting snakes loose in the Commonwealth Games Village that has been built on the riverbed.        
	Ironically, it has also made Delhi look better.        
	 The rain has also cleared the smog that sits thick over Nehru Place making its high-rises visible from East Delhi  Jamna Paar as many of Delhis residents call this bank  and breathing is that much easier.        
	 Of course, Nehru Place and Ring Road, like the other main roads, have got new streetlights or the old ones have been cleaned and shine brighter.        
	 In three weeks flat, Indias capital is presenting a face that has its warts powdered convincingly. Pampered  some would say at the cost of India itself  it is almost as if the ugly Delhi of a month back has metamorphosed.        
	It is not quite pretty  the waters of the Yamuna and the reflections in them are so deceptive  but it has the makings of a global urban centre.        
	The torn roads with debris piled every 300 metres that made the city look so ugly have vanished or have been boarded over. Traffic is slower but it is moving despite the dedicated Games Lane reserved for athletes and officials vehicles and their police escorts.        
	The rickety buses  Bluelines, some were called  that raced and killed have all but vanished, replaced by sleek wide-windowed Red and Green low-floor air-conditioned buses. A windshield tour makes Delhi look even better.        
	For months, Yusuf Sarai  on the arterial connection between India Gate at the centre of the city and the Qutub Minar in its deep south  was a dusty stretch fit for Himalayan rallyists in four-by-fours. It is just beyond AIIMS, the countrys best-known hospital, to which patients and care-givers come from all over. Like them, South Delhis rich citizens too had to pick their way gingerly over it.        
	Suddenly almost, it is black-topped with a special quick-compacting asphalt used by the armed forces for airstrips in the mountains.        
	But just step inside Arjun Nagar, away from the main road, and the smaller roads, lanes and bylanes are as they always were  congested and uncared for, overhead cables strung from broken building to cracked tenement, the gutters are open and the garbage has spilled from the vats.        
	Wherever the road is marked by a thick yellow band, it is a Delhi that is on a fast lane. A vehicle with a CWG number plate is the capitals latest status symbol. It can take the Games Lane, zip past standstill traffic in peak hours.        
	CWGs Delhi has bypassed its inner cities.                                            
	Even today, on the third day of the Games, the capital is getting touched up. Outside Dilli Haat, Delhi Tourisms open space in South Delhi where tourists come to shop for handicrafts from across the country and to taste the varied cuisine, workers are kneeling down on the red-sandstone pavements, furiously cleaning the dust that has gathered between the tiles.        
	In hours, the pavements will be washed and the workers either taken to another venue or dumped at the railway station, their hands rubber-stamped for the free train-ride to ensure they are deported from their capital.        
	Dilli Haat is now hosting a handicrafts and handloom fair. Further south, in Mehrauli, the Qutub Fest of classical music and dance has coincided with the Games. In CP  Connaught Place  the central greens are the venue for a food fest. All of it goes into making this South Asias most happening city for the moment.        
	Lutyens Delhi has always been sparsely populated and green with reasonably smooth traffic. It is the city around the VIP zone that is feeling the CWG now.        
	It is reasonable to ask, if this is what Delhi can do to itself in three weeks, why did it take all of seven years? The breakneck speed that civic authorities exhibited in the past month also has its citizens asking: will the flyovers hold? Will the metro keep running? Will the roads still be evenly surfaced?        
	Delhi went for a makeover. It has got layers of make-up.

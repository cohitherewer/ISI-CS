          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 29: Banks may have to wind up their teaser interest rate schemes for home loans after the Reserve Bank of India tightened its monetary policy today.        
	After the RBI raised the cash reserve ratio, or CRR (money banks have to mandatorily keep with the RBI), by 75 basis points, experts said they didnt expect the enticing low rates in the early years of a loan tenure to continue.         
	Last February, the State Bank of India (SBI) had kicked off an industry-wide trend when it capped the interest rate on home loans at 8 per cent in the first year with the rider that the rate would be linked to the banks benchmark rate in subsequent years. Later, it modified the scheme several times to make it more attractive.         
	The teaser rate was a big hit and the SBIs loan sanctions leapt to Rs 2,000 crore a month, sparking a mortgage rate war as rivals came out with their own versions of the scheme.        
	Bankers say the hawkish stance in the RBIs monetary policy, which comes less than three weeks after it sounded a warning about the teaser rates, will force banks to slam the window on these schemes very soon.        
	At present, the SBI has a scheme called My Home Campaign that is due to run till March 31. For loans up to Rs 5 lakh with a maximum tenure of 10 years, the SBI Hi-Five Home Loan carries a fixed rate of 8 per cent for five years.         
	For loans above Rs 5 lakh and up to Rs 50 lakh, the SBI Easy Home Loan carries a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent in the first year and 8.5 per cent during the second and third years.        
	However, with the central bank raising the CRR by more than what was expected and the possibility of interest rate hikes looming, banking circles say these schemes are unlikely to be extended.        
	Senior bankers were not, however, prepared to comment on such a possibility just yet.        
	It (the CRR hike and possible interest rate increases ahead) could discourage such teaser rates as they will become unviable for banks, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.        
	A senior official from another nationalised bank, who agrees with this view but does not wish to be identified, said that though interest rates on home loans would not rise immediately because of the CRR increase, the days of a rate war in home loans were almost over.        
	Interest rates on home loans may stay where they are for now but the special schemes are unlikely to be extended, he added.        
	Earlier this month, RBI deputy governor Usha Thorat had expressed concern that borrowers might not be aware of the implications of a subsequent rate rise that could constrain their ability to repay the loans.

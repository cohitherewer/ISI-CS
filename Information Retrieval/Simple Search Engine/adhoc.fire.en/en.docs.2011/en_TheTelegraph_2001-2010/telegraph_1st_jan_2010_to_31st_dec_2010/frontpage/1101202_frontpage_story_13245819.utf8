          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                            Iti Mrilanini being shot at the Indian Botanic Garden                                  
	The high court on Wednesday directed the Indian Botanic Garden in Shibpur not to allow any social gathering or commercial activity, including film shooting, on the premises.        
	The garden authorities will have to ensure that nothing, other than botanical activity, is allowed on the premises, the division bench of Justice A. Kabir and Justice Shukla Kabir (Sinha) ruled.        
	The lawyer appearing for the garden, maintained by the Botanical Survey of India of the Union environment and forest ministry, submitted that the management had undertaken various programmes for the betterment of the sprawling greens and banned social gatherings on the campus.        
	The bench asked the management not to allow film shooting on the campus as such activities disturb the ecological balance of the garden.        
	The court left it to the authorities to decide whom they would allow to have a picnic in the garden. Picnics that can affect plants and trees should not be allowed, the bench said.        
	A section of the citys film fraternity, however, rued the ban on shooting. Somak Mukherjee, who had shot Aparna Sen-directed Iti Mrinalini at the botanical garden, felt the scenic location could not be replicated. Its a wonderful location with rare trees, the small lake in their midst, pathways covered by leaves. We had shot a key sequence of Iti Mrinalini there, said Mukherjee.        
	Wednesdays order follows a petition by environment activist Subhash Dutta, who had moved the court in January after a Howrah businessman held a wedding reception at the garden.        
	Dutta, who had claimed that the reception was held with the full knowledge of the authorities, submitted several photographs showing how the January 24 event had damaged many herbs, including some rare varieties.        
	The state of affairs at the garden came under judicial scanner in January last year after the authorities were accused of illegally felling trees and selling them to timber merchants. Following a petition by Dutta, the high court had set up a three-man committee to probe the felling of trees.        
	The inquiry committee hinted that a tree smuggler from Bihar had bought the chopped trees. The court then framed guidelines for the maintenance of the garden, which Dutta alleged the management had violated while allowing the wedding reception on the premises.

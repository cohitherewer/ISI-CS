The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Election priority pushes back Ray
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Election priority pushes back Ray
          CITHARA PAUL AND MOHUA DAS                                        Satyajit Ray    
	Nov. 30: In an election year, Satyajit Ray can wait.         
	The Bengal government has asked the Centre to push a tourism scheme in the Dooars ahead of the Satyajit Ray Film Trail Mega Tourism Project.        
	The trail was to cover locations where Pather Panchali and other Ray films were shot, especially near Santiniketan. Prototypes of scenes shot at different locations were to be part of the trail, with a brief description of the script and narration of some memorable events during the shooting.         
	Now, Bengal tourism minister Manabendra Mukherjee has written to Union minister Kumari Selja and asked her to reconsider prioritising Dooars for the Rs 50-crore mega project.         
	Each state has been allowed to choose one tourism project as a mega project. Many countries, including Britain and the US, have successfully developed tourist packages around shooting locales, film studios and characters.        
	Having discussed the matter internally at the state level and given the enormous tourism potential of the Dooars region, may I request you to kindly reconsider prioritising Dooars for the mega tourism project for 2010-2011? The Satyajit Ray Film Trail may also be please treated as a mega project but we feel that the Dooars Project is more important, Mukherjee wrote in August.         
	Until then, the Dooars project had not been mentioned.         
	The Centre is perplexed by the state governments change of mind. The state government had been actively working for the Satyajit Ray project till recently. It is not yet clear why Bengal has decided to put it on hold, a Union tourism ministry official said.         
	Mukherjee today told The Telegraph: The Satyajit Ray Film Trail Mega Tourism Project is still our priority project. The central government was going to commission a huge sum of money for one particular project and since finance-wise the film on the Dooars region would require a bigger budget, we chose to go ahead with that one. The Satyajit Ray film trail project would not require as much finance.        
	On being asked about what happens to the Ray film trail plan, Mukherjee explained, We have sent the proposal for this project to Delhi and waiting for their clearance.        
	Rays son Sandip said: They had come to me nearly two years ago expressing their interest in filming a heritage tourism film on places where Baba had shot. I had told them that the places have changed from the time we shot and put them across to Ramesh Sen, one of Babas assistant directors who had worked on most of his films.        
	Sen said he never heard from them after they got in touch with me last year.         
	I dont know anything about the Dooars project. I never heard from them after they got in touch with me last year wanting my help on identifying shooting spots in Bengal where Satyajitbabu had shot some of his films especially places in and around Bolpur. I had pointed out Purulia, Shiuri, Goalpara, Ilambazar, Gorakhpur and many more places. They were very keen on going for a recce of the place and had said theyd like to take me along once they start shooting but I dont know what happened afterwards, Sen said.        
	Sources said political compulsions  the Assembly elections are due in months  had forced the Left Front governments hand.         
	The Dooars region, with its shattered socio-economic condition, could do great harm to the Left parties as there has been zero government intervention in the region. Now the government wants to spend the Rs 50 crore meant for the tourism project to develop infrastructure in the region, a tourism department official said.        
	In an election year, what counts is immediate results which are palpable. A project in the name of Satyajit Ray may bring in foreign tourists in the long run but it will not help the Left in getting votes, the official added.

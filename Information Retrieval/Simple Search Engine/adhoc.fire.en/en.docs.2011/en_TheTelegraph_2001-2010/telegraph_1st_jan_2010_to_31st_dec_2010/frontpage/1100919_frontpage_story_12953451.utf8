          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                             Vinod Sinha being taken to a court in Ranchi on Saturday. (Prashant Mitra)                                   
	Ranchi, Sept. 18: Vinod Sinha, a key aide of former chief minister Madhu Koda, was today remanded to CBI custody for 10 days while his lawyer alleged in court that his arrest on Thursday in Delhi was illegal.        
	Sinha, who was brought to the state capital by a service flight this afternoon, claimed, I am innocent , while CBI officials had tough time negotiating a crowd of journalists while taking him out of the airport.        
	The CBI is understood to have taken him to its Morabadi office first after which he was taken to court.        
	Wearing a striped shirt and formal trousers, Sinha was brought to the special court of Pankaj Kumar around 3pm. He was made to stand in a corner of the jampacked courtroom, which had to hear the case under a battery operated emergency light and candles, as there was a power failure.        
	Arguing that Sinhas detention was illegal, his advocate Pandey Neeraj Rai said that his detention was unlawful as the apex court had ordered his arrest should wait till the income tax department completed investigations.         
	He said Sinha was co-operating with the investigating agencies and narrated the circumstances that led to his detention. CBI officials raided Sinhas flat in Delhi around 10.30pm on September 15. Around 7.30am the next day, he was asked to come to the CBI office at 10.30am to answer a few queries.         
	Sinha did as he was told.        
	Rai, who produced the gate pass issued to him at the CBI office as documentary evidence, said finally, the CBI claimed that Sinha had been arrested on September 16 and moved an application to take him on remand.        
	My clients detention is unlawful. When the Supreme Court had passed this order, the CBI was not in the picture. He has always been extending due Cupertino to all investigating agencies, including the CBI. Further, an accused cannot be treated as an absconder, Rai claimed, adding that he had been running here and there for his own safety.        
	Seeking a 12-day remand, CBI counsel Rakesh Prasad argued that the CBI took over the case at the orders of Jharkhand High Court and that Sinhas custodial remand was very important completing investigations.        
	While the arguments were made in court, the judge passed order to remand him to CBI custody for 10 days in his chamber.         
	I have been made to stand for such a long time. How long will they keep me like this, Sinha was heard telling his lawyer while being taken to the judges chamber.

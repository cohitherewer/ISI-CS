          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Nithyananda                          
	Chennai, March 6: Police have charged tainted seer Nithyananda with rape and intimidation after a former associate presented new DVDs on his purported sexual encounters and a written complaint accusing him of various crimes.        
	The associate, Lenin, told the Chennai police commissioner it was he who had secretly videotaped the bedroom scenes allegedly involving Nithyananda and actress Ranjitha at the swamis Bangalore ashram.        
	After the footage was beamed on TV this week, Nithyananda, 32, a Tamil Nadu seer with a big following in India and abroad, went into hiding while his ashrams were vandalised across his home state and his pictures burnt. The police registered a case of cheating against him. Now Lenin has accused him of male rape and threats of violence too.        
	Lenin said he had lived at the Bangalore ashram from 2006 till 2009 and had been given the spiritual name of Srinithya Dharmananda by the seer.        
	Though I left the ashram in December last, I went to attend a programme of Nithyananda at Salem last month. Having found out that I had a video of him and Ranjitha, with whom he has had a long relationship, he and three of his subordinates threatened me and demanded that I hand over the DVD. I managed to escape and then released copies of the video with a covering letter to various media houses, Lenin said in his complaint.        
	He alleged that Nithyananda would tell women devotees he was an avatar of Krishna and that they were gopikas, and so he could hug them whenever he wanted.        
	A few male devotees left the ashram after the seer forced them to have sex with him, Lenin alleged. One person died under suspicious circumstances in the ashram and another devotee attempted suicide, he said.        
	Based on his complaint, the Chennai police have registered cases against Nithyananda for rape, conspiracy, cheating, hurting religious feelings, forcing others into unnatural sex and threatening people with physical injury.        
	Since these crimes happened at Nithyanandas ashram near Bangalore, we will be transferring the case to Karnataka police and will provide whatever assistance they need, commissioner T. Rajendran said.        
	He admitted that Lenin was the only person to have filed a specific complaint against Nithyananda.

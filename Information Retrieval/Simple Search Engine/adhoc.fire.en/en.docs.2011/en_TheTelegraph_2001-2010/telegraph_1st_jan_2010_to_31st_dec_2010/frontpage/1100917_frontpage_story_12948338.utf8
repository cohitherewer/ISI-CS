          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 16: Rahul Gandhi today said the allegation that Mamata Banerjee was openly supporting Maoists was an exaggeration, the choice of word fuelling a debate if he felt there could be a grain of truth in the collusion charge.        
	Asked how he viewed the allegation against Mamata, Rahul told a media conference: To say Mamataji is openly supporting the Maoists is an exaggeration.        
	Mamatas rivals were quick to pounce on the word exaggeration to claim it amounted to a suggestion of some hobnobbing between the Trinamul Congress chief and the rebels  an allegation Mamata had been trying to debunk.        
	CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim said: By using the word exaggeration, Rahul has upheld our views about the Trinamul-Maoist bonhomie. He didnt say that Mamata Banerjee doesnt have a nexus with the Maoists. So, our views have been supported by him. Its clearer now that Trinamul has an open alliance with the Congress and a clandestine link with the Maoists.        
	A controversy had broken out after Mamata raised questions at the August 9 Lalgarh rally over the way Maoist spokesperson Azad was killed.         
	Told today that Mamata was against the deployment of joint forces in Jungle Mahal, Rahul said: On the security forces issue, the state had asked the Centre for it. It was the duty of the Centre to support the state.        
	The Trinamul chief had been opposing joint operations on the plea that the CPM was using the central forces to recapture ground in the Maoist-hit belt.        
	Rahul did not mince words today while fielding questions on the Maoists. Naxalism is the result of a complex set of circumstances. Poverty and lack of political connectivity have to do with Naxalism. If we can improve these, notably among the tribals, things can improve. But we are against violence. If you are a Naxalite and killed 50 people, you are a criminal, he said.        
	Rahul added: I dont kill people. But the Maoists do. Thats my difference with the Maoists. But I feel if there is political connectivity with the Maoists, they wont do that.

          SANTOSH K KIRO                               
	Ranchi, Jan. 4: Jharkhand will have to bear with the cold wave-like conditions sweeping across the state for the next four days with city temperatures hovering around 7 degrees celsius today, amid reports that more than 20 people, mostly from the rural interiors, had died.        
	Government officials would not confirm figures, but did not deny the possibility of a few deaths, even as the state labour department scrambled to organise blankets to be distributed among the needy in the districts and villages.        
	Schools across the state, especially those in Ranchi, will revise class timings from Tuesday, a day after the Ranchi district administration issued guidelines in view of the cold wave-like conditions in Jharkhand. The new timings will be followed till January 31.        
	The minimum temperature recorded in the state capital today was 10 degrees Celsius, up by around 5 degrees from yesterdays chilling 4.9. In Jamshedpur, the minimum temperature was 8 degrees Celsius and in Daltonganj, it was 7.3 degrees Celsius.         
	However, rural areas have been witnessing minimum temperatures below 5 degrees Celsius for quite sometime now.         
	At Kanke, on the outskirts of the state capital, the minimum temperature has been around 3-4 degrees Celsius for the last week.         
	The rural areas are going through extreme conditions with temperatures below 3 to 4 degrees Celsius. This condition is likely to continue for another three-four days, said A. Wadood, the weather scientist at Birsa Agriculture University (Kanke).         
	The chilly weather conditions, aggravated by the cold wind from the north-west, is bad for the Rabi crops, especially potato, the prices of which had sky-rocketed days ago. A layer of smoke above the crops helps control the damage, Wadood added.        
	Met office director G.K. Mohanty agreed with Wadoods assessment and said these conditions would prevail for the next three-four days.         
	Temperatures in villages have dipped due to local conditions and will take a while to return to anywhere near normal, he said. Last night, chief minister Shibu Soren distributed 300 blankets among the poor in the state capital.         
	Deputy commissioners in districts have been asked to distribute blankets among the poor and the needy, said Umesh Prasad, the deputy secretary, social security wing of the state labour department.        
	The state administration had sanctioned Rs 1 crore for buying blankets to be distributed among poor villagers in districts.         
	But due to the model code of conduct, the blankets could not be bought, explained the development commissioner and labour secretary, S.K. Choudhary.         
	But, now that Assembly elections are over and a government is in place, deputy commissioners are on the job, Choudhary said, adding that the distribution of blankets would be completed over the next three-four days.        
	Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (RIMS) medical superintendent A.K. Mahto said as of now there was no victim of the cold wave in the hospital, though he did not rule out the possibility of deaths under such severe weather conditions.        
	Cold wave conditions increase the possibility of strokes and heart attacks. For asthma patients, the extreme weather condition is really dreadful, the medical superintendent added.         
	Officials of the disaster management department, who deal with casualty figures, said they had not yet received any information from the districts on deaths due to the cold.

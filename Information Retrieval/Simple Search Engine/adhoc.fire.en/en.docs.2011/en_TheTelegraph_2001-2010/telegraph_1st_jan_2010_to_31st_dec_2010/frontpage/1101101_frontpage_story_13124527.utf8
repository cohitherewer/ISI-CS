  - Ranchi Police personnel fail to hit bullseye at annual assessment session           A.S.R.P. MUKESH                                           
	Ranchi, Oct. 31: The guns were loaded. The concentration, intense. The target, barely 60 yards away. But as the men and women who make up the Ranchi police force took position, it became obvious that marksmanship was not one of their strengths.         
	Todays target practice session at the JAP-2 grounds at Tatisilwai was part of the ongoing 11-day shooting assessment camp of Ranchi Police that began on October 22.         
	As many as 4,000 personnel are attending the camp, including officers, havildars and traffic policemen.         
	Though officers supervising the camp insisted that the shooting skills of the jawans had improved by as much as 70 per cent over the last two years, the picture appeared to be very different.         
	The personnel were divided into random batches of 10 and each had to fire 10 rounds. Almost none could hit the target all 10 times. Just a couple per batch managed a strike rate of five out of 10.         
	Only a handful of shooters, including assistant sub-inspectors and sub-inspectors, appeared to have their eyes fixed on the target and their ears tuned for the siren as they took aim. Others were not so confident. Hands shook, and some could not even insert bullets in the magazine out of sheer nervousness.         
	Later, some blamed the rains for missing the target, while others claimed something had fallen in their eyes at the last moment. Yet others insisted they had improved a lot compared to the last time.         
	Whatever the justification, the fact remained that for the city police, hitting bullseye was still a distant dream. We couldnt organise the assessment camp last year. But compared to the results two years ago, this year we have found that shooting skills have improved by over 70 per cent, said Ravinder Kumar Prasad, the officer facilitating the camp.         
	He added that hitting the target between six and eight out of 10 tries was considered average, nine was good and 10 was excellent.         
	On an average, 400 jawans were being assessed daily, and if the records of the last two days were taken into account, over 50 per cent were below average, 30 per cent qualified as mediocre and only 10-20 per cent made the mark.        
	The comprehensive report is yet to be prepared. However, its true that even some top officers fared badly. Lack of practise could be a reason. We are planning a refresher course soon, Prasad offered in way of explanation.

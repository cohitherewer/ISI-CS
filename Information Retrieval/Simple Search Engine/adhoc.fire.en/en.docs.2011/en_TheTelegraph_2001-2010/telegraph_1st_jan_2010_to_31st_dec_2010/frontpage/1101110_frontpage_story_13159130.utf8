          OUR BUREAU                               
	Hazaribagh/Ranchi, Nov. 9: Alice Usha Rani Singh, a former secretary of the Jharkhand Public Service Commission that is being investigated for handing out jobs to family, friends and their relatives, was arrested today, six months after FIRs were lodged against her and four of her colleagues.        
	A team of vigilance officials, that was at her residence in Haragunj in Hazaribagh to attach her property, laid a trap for the former JPSC secretary after being tipped off that she was on her way home from Dhanbad via Vishnugarh.        
	Hazaribagh Muffasil police apprehended Singh soon after, making her the first member of the tainted body to be arrested.        
	FIRs were lodged on June 9 against her and four others  former JPSC chairman Dilip Prasad and former members Radha Govind Nagesh, Shanti Devi and Gopal Singh  for grave irregularities, forgery, interpolation and fraud in conducting the second civil services examinations of 2007-08.        
	As many as 19 new recruits, chosen on the basis of these examinations and interviews, have since been dismissed after a preliminary enquiry.        
	Confirming the first arrest in the JPSC muddle, vigilance IG M.V.Rao said Singh would be produced before the designated vigilance court in Ranchi tomorrow even as a special task force set up by them was on the look out for the other former JPSC members.        
	He said they would move against them as soon as their anticipatory bail applications were disposed of by the Jharkhand High Court.         
	The court, in a case filed by Prasad challenging the vigilance courts order to attach his property, had ruled that attachment could not be carried out till his anticipatory bail application was decided .         
	Early this morning, a team led by deputy superintendent of police (vigilance) S.C Choudhary arrived at Singhs residence to attach her property. But while the vigilance officials were loading her belongings onto three tractors, they received a tip-off on her and chose to act on it.        
	After her arrest, the team accompanied her to Ranchi.         
	In January 2009, then governor Syed Sibtey Razi had ordered the vigilance bureau to probe allegations of irregularities committed by JPSC while recruiting 60 deputy collectors by conducting written exams and interviews.         
	As many as 7,500 candidates had applied.        
	In October last year, then Jharkhand Governor K. Sankaranarayanan ordered a vigilance probe into charges of nepotism and corruption against the former JPSC chairman, three former members and a former secretary for misusing their official positions to appoint friends, family members and close relatives to various state government posts.

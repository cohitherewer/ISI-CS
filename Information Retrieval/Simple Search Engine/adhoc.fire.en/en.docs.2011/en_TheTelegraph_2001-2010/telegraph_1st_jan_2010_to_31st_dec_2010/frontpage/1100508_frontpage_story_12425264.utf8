The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tribal CM a sore point 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tribal CM a sore point 
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                             Arjun Munda (top); Yashwant Sinha                                 
	Ranchi, May 7: The JMMs insistence on a tribal chief minister has widened its communication gap with the BJP.         
	According to sources, the JMM negotiators led by Hemant Soren insisted that the chief minister should be from among tribal MLAs, a condition the BJP refuses to accept for the top slot.         
	BJP sources said senior party leaders proposed the name of former external affairs minister and Hazaribagh MP Yaswant Sinha for the job, which was vehemently opposed by the JMM.        
	We do not want Soren, a tribal icon, to be replaced by a diku (a derogatory word for non-tribals), said a senior JMM leader.        
	However, the JMM is unwilling to accept Arjun Munda as chief minister as well. Munda had been groomed by the JMM before he switched over to the BJP in late 1990s. The JMM fears that Munda, with his contacts in JMM circles, will try to split the party and ensure a comfortable number for the BJP to run the government in future, confided a senior BJP leader of the state.        
	Munda is not a Santhal. We are aware of the ethnic conflict between Santhals and Mundas. So choosing Arjun Munda will not go down well with our electorate, countered a JMM leader, adding that the conditions set by his party ruled out Sinha, Munda and Raghubar Das for the top job.         
	According to the senior JMM leader, the choice may narrow down to transport minister Neelkanth Singh Munda or food and civil supplies minister Barkuanr Gagrai, provided the BJP accepts the JMMs terms. Neither Das nor Munda may want another tribal leader to emerge and create another power centre in the BJP. So, we want to expose the inner conflict within that party, the JMM leader said.        
	In Delhi, JMM leaders went into a huddle in the evening. Speaking to The Telegraph before that, Hemant Soren said: We have made our options clear to the BJP. Now, the ball is in their court.                          
	 A senior BJP leader from the state, who is now in Delhi, told The Telegraph that the party leadership would not accept the pre-condition set by the JMM. The BJP parliamentary board will sit tomorrow or day after tomorrow to reiterate the decision taken on April 28, he said.        
	Hemant flew to Delhi with his father and chief minister Shibh Soren, Hemlal Murmu, Mathura Mahto, Shashank Shekhar Bhokta and deputy chief ministers Raghubar Das and Sudesh Mahto late last evening. Soren, significantly, did not attend todays meeting with the BJP and remained his official North Avenue residence.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Why India hates   to hate Barack 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                     
	New Delhi, Nov. 9: When diehard anti-imperialists rejoice in a Peace Nobel to a White House incumbent, its reason to reflect. When bleeding-heart peaceniks begin to understand the laureates war whereas they had lambasted his predecessors, its cause to wonder. When communists break their boycott of an American President and arrive to applaud, its time to begin inquiring.        
	What is it about Barack Obama that makes even those who loathe America love him? What is it about this man that casts him in the beam of a spotlight all his own, unhinged from the umbra of the evil empire that he presides over?        
	Obama has proceeded, the hold of Air Force One spilling over with gathered goodies, his strategic objectives assuming concrete contours on his workstation. Yet the story Obama appears to have left behind is of favours he granted rather than the favours he got.        
	To him, surely, it was an its-all-about-economics-silly trip, the message ringing loud off the mid-term spank handed Obama by the electorate back home. To most of us, it seems to have been quite the opposite of hard business  Its not about America, silly, its all about the man.        
	Obama has left Indian hearts iridescent in the afterglow of his departing jet. Never, perhaps, has an American President been seen or judged by the Indian eye as so blamelessly insulated from the often unsavoury requirements of the office he holds.        
	Sociologist Ashis Nandy is sharp to warn of the perils of separating the man from the task he has been elected to.         
	One reason (for gushing Obama adulation among Indians) can be that there is symbolism attached to his being black, Nandy says.        
	But I think that symbolism has worn off a bit. We should not forget that US institutions are strong. It is the institutions that make a President and it needs enormous political skills on the part of a President to get his way. Clinton did that. Obama does not have that skill. Technically, there is no reason why we should love Obama more than Bush. In fact, Bush was much nicer to India, openly partisan towards India.        
	The White House is no dressing room of virtue. Vice, quite often, as Machiavelli reminded us long ago, is an essential virtue in rulers. The art of manipulation and manoeuvring. The temper to manage contradictions. The sagacity to employ faith and to employ suspicion. The talent to marry firmness with flexibility. Sleight of hand. Glibness of tongue. And, when required, the dint to be diabolical.        
	It can be nobodys case Obama has got where he has innocent of the obligations of the rough road. But theres a Teflon quality to him; or is it merely that he is black?         
	That, if anything, is a grey issue. To former CPM MP Hannan Mollah, shunning Obama, like they shunned George Bush Jr and Bill Clinton before him, was not an option simply for reasons of race and colour. He is an Afro-American and there is a long-running sentiment of solidarity among Indians with black people, how can we forget that? How could we have boycotted such a man?         
	But to a comrade of Mollahs who wouldnt be named, its about more than just the colour of his skin. Its about the stables from which he has arrived, different stables, different from those that produced many Presidents of the past.                    
	To her it was more about what Obama is not than what he is. He is not the Ugly American, and that is what is most different and warming about him, she says. He is not overbearing of manner, he is not full of himself as most Americans tend to be, he does not talk down, and he is prepared to listen and willing to explain.         
	She could have added he is equally willing with praise, something humans  Indians in particular  are not particularly averse to.        
	When great Indians are quoted to Indians by visitors  as Obama did eloquently and repeatedly  to suggest they too might possess the inherited shine of bygone glory, Indians become easy to please.        
	Obama is probably also fortunate he follows after eight years of the world having to cope with George Bush Jr blunt, blundering, burdened and blinded by self-belief rather than accumulated wisdom.        
	In comparison, says an Indian diplomat who avers he isnt rosy-eyed about Obama or his presidency, the man is almost civilisational.        
	He effuses values that we not only deeply respect as a people but are a bit in awe of, often jealous of. He is educated, erudite, plural, young, open. There is a human part of him that often  and dangerously for others  masks the political aspect of him. He is nobodys fool, but he can lure you into thinking hes just the man next door.         
	Sonia Gandhi got that sense off Obama during his Central Hall address and at the two dinners hosted to toast the visit. Very personable, the UPA chairperson is learnt to have told leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj. He is so easy to talk to.        
	Thats the grand and simple trick Barack Obama has slipped into the persona of his presidency.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 3: Schools upset about incorrect or out-of-course questions in this years Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) public examinations can seek redress by submitting a list of concerns to the board within 24 hours of the examination.         
	The countrys largest secondary education board has asked all affiliated schools to desist from complaining about question papers to the media and has put in place a formal redress mechanism for the first time.         
	In a letter to all affiliated schools ahead of the board examinations that started today, the CBSE has promised that an expert panel will examine all concerns sent by schools within 24 hours of the examination.         
	These complaints, if found justified by the expert panel, will be taken into account while finalising the marking scheme for the subject, the letter by the boards chief controller of examinations, M.C. Sharma, states.         
	The question papers for the Class X and XII board exams are finalised after layers of scrutiny.         
	But practically every year after the test, students criticise the board for carrying questions that they allege are either misleading or inaccurate, or are out of the prescribed course.         
	Schools, keen to showcase their students results, pick up the grievances and often air them in interviews with the media.         
	Often, schools form a collective group and approach the CBSE for compensatory marks.         
	The CBSE, faced with public pressure, often agrees to the demands but board officials describe the process as arbitrary.         
	Decisions affecting the lives of millions of students should not be taken based on whether some can manufacture public pressure, a senior board official argued.         
	Now, the CBSE has sent all affiliated schools a form that they can fill and send back listing concerns on a particular question paper, within 24 hours of the examination.         
	The form lists four kinds of concerns that generally arise from the papers  questions considered out of the syllabus, beyond the comprehension level of students, defective formulation of questions and faulty translations.         
	The official argued that the advice to refrain from complaining through the media was not aimed as an attempt to gag schools.         
	The CBSE letter to schools argues that a media storm based on complaints often upsets students during preparations for the next examination.         
	The credibility of the board and the examinations is also compromised. CBSE and the schools have a responsibility to see that observations and comments are not made to gain cheap popularity, the letter added.

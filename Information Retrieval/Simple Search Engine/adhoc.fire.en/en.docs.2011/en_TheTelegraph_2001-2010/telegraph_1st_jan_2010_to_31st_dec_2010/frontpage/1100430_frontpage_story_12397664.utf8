          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 29: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today offered relief to air passengers by partially rolling back the service tax his budget had proposed on every plane ticket, domestic or international.        
	The budget had levied a 10 per cent service tax on all airline tickets, but this has now been reduced to a flat Rs 100 per ticket for domestic travellers and Rs 500 per ticket for international passengers.        
	For instance, if you buy a domestic air ticket for Rs 4,000, you would need to pay just Rs 100 extra rather than the Rs 400 mandated by the original budget proposals. If you buy an international ticket for Rs 50,000, the service tax will now be Rs 500 rather than Rs 5,000.        
	An Air India spokesperson indicated that as of now, airlines planned to absorb the revised tax and would not raise the fares.        
	The small increase of Rs 100 on domestic tickets would have no impact on air ticket prices, the spokesperson said. The international travel service tax of Rs 500 would also have no impact.        
	Earlier, service tax used to be charged only on foreign travel and that too only for business class or first class.        
	Mukherjee, in his reply to the finance bill debate, said he had received complaints from various quarters that the proposed 10 per cent tax would make air travel prohibitively expensive and hurt the civil aviation sector.        
	I would like to clarify that it would not be so. It would not be linked to the percentage of the fare, he said. He added that air travel to and from the northeastern states would be exempt from the service tax net.        
	The aviation industry, still to come out of the red, had been seeking a rollback. The industry lost about Rs 8,000 crore in 2008-09 and has since then recorded a modest growth, gaining momentum with a growth of 20-25 per cent only in the first two months of 2010.        
	Home-buyer sop        
	Mukherjee also brought relief to new home buyers by slashing the proposed tax on the realty sector. Under the revised proposals, these companies will have to pay tax on only 25 per cent of the value of the constructed property, against the 33 per cent originally proposed in the budget.

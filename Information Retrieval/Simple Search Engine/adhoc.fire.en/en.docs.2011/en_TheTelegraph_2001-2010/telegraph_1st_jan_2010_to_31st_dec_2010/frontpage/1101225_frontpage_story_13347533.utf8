The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Turkey goes desi in tandoor 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Turkey goes desi in tandoor 
  - Dish finds way to British Indian plates with a dash of spice          AMIT ROY                            Celebrity chef Nigella Lawson puts her turkey into the oven for a traditional recipe                                        
	London, Dec. 24: Cyrus Todiwala was today in his restaurant, Caf Spice Namaste, in East London, meeting the hectic pre-Christmas rush but took a few minutes off to talk turkey  literally  with The Telegraph.        
	Frankly, turkey is not one of my favourite meats but the Brits love it at Christmas time  they feel good if they eat turkey, he acknowledged.        
	Over the decades, taste for turkey has also spread to Indians, which is why Todiwala, one of Britains best known Indian chefs  he has just gained entry to the British Whos Who  was busy spicing up turkey dishes for his Indian clientele.        
	In fact, nagged by British-born children who would feel left out if turkey was not included on the menu, Indian parents all over the UK will be sitting down to turkey for lunch on Christmas Day.        
	And in a market-driven economy, butchers have sold hundreds of thousands of halal turkeys to their Muslim customers.         
	There was a time when first-generation Indians steered clear of turkey  too tough to be curried, they declared.        
	But with passing time, turkey has become part of the Indian diet, at least at Christmas. Mixed with chilli and a little lime pickle, turkey can be transformed.        
	Todiwala, who used to work in the Taj Mahal Hotel in Bombay (before it became Mumbai), can recall the halcyon days when turkey was brought into kitchens at Christmas with a great sense of occasion.        
	There were only a few people who bred turkey in Bombay but we roasted it in the traditional British way, he remembered. Our guests expected that.        
	In Britain, the traditional turkey recipe has been Indianised.        
	Unlike chicken it is too big a bird to go in whole into a tandoor but smaller pieces can be made into turkey tikka, explained Todiwala.                  Tandoori turkey      
	The preparation was much the same as for chicken but the cooking time is critical  if overcooked turkey tastes like leather, he remarked, screwing up his face.        
	His face brightened when he was asked about the possibilities for turkey curry.        
	Haan, hota hai (its possible) but the pieces have to be very small  I do a turkey pasanda, added Todiwala. Once it would have been difficult finding butchers that stocked turkey slaughtered according to Islamic requirements. Today, high street butchers and even some supermarkets have entered the game with gusto.        
	 Tomorrow in dining rooms decorated with Christmas trees and fairy lights, turkey will be served in Muslim homes across the land.        
	I think the demand has been created by a lot of mixed marriages in this country, commented one butcher, who has sold more turkeys than chickens in the last few days. Also, people want to try different foods.         
	The spiced turkey may have become a symbol of multicultural Britain.        
	A Muslim mother in Manchester said: A turkey dinner seems to have become a special thing to look forward to by Muslims. We roast our turkey but we spice it up. Ours is more of a tandoori turkey. The stuffing is made from spiced potatoes. The turkey is marinated overnight with all the tandoori spices. I dont think any of us, even the children, would eat it just plain.

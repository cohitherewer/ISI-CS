	New Delhi, July 15: When Deepika Padukone endorses soap or blue jeans or Kareena Kapoor ambles with a laptop in her hand, theyre doing more than just grabbing eyeballs.         
	A new brain imaging study has shown that endorsements by celebrities work through the memories of consumers  and not through the attractiveness of celebrities nor through their perceived expertise.         
	We know celebrity endorsements work  what we are exploring is why celebrity endorsements work, said Mirre Stallen, lead author of the study and doctoral researcher at the Rotterdam School of Management at Erasmus University and the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour in the Netherlands.         
	Stallen and her colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging to study the brain functions that appear to underlie the effects of fame on the memory of a product and on the intention to buy.         
	Their findings described in the Journal of Economic Psychology suggest that the effectiveness of celebrities is the result of the transfer of positive emotions from celebrity to the product.         
	Celebrities in ads may attract attention, but it is the positive emotions associated with a celebrity that are transferred to the product, Stallen told The Telegraph.         
	The transfer of positive emotions from celebrity to the product occurs through a memory association process, said Ale Smidts, a professor of product marketing research at the Rotterdam School of Management and a member of the study team.         
	The team examined magnetic resonance imaging brain scans of 23 Dutch women who were first shown digital colour images of women celebrities and non-famous women, and then shown 240 additional images showing celebrity-shoe combinations.         
	The researchers found that the brain activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, a key region for positive emotions and the learning of association, was transferred from celebrity to the shoe.         
	The study has also shown that influence of celebrities on the intent to purchase was strongest for products (shoes  in this study) regarded as normal or pretty, but not to fanciful.         
	Stallen said the transfer of positive emotions from celebrity to a product appears to be a general mechanism through which celebrity endorsement operates, though this needs to be tested.         
	In an earlier study, Smidts and his colleagues had shown that for a celebrity advertisement to be effective, the celebrity should have some expertise with the advertised product.         
	Although we havent tested it, it is very likely that similar results will be found with male subjects, Stallen said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Guwahati, Dec. 3: UNLF chairman Raj Kumar Meghen alias Sana Yaima told a special court here today that he was detained in Bangladesh on September 29, rubbishing the National Investigation Agencys claim that the rebel leader from Manipur had been arrested near Motihari in Bihar on November 30.        
	I was detained in Bangladesh on September 29, Yaima told reporters outside the special NIA court here, where he was produced by the investigation agency.        
	The militant leader was remanded in 13-day NIA custody in connection with a case registered here.         
	He has been booked under Sections 120(B)/121/-121(A)/122/468 IPC and under Section 10/13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on charges of illegal activities against the government of India, extortion and other illegal acts.         
	He will be produced in the special court on December 16.        
	Yaimas counsel M. Gunedhor Singh said the chairman of the Manipur-based United National Liberation Front told the court that he had been detained in Bangladesh on September 29 and kept in secret detention for 61 days before being taken to West Bengal through the Indo-Bangladesh border on November 29. The same day, he was taken to Calcutta and kept in a police cell. On November 30, he was taken to Motihari in Bihars East Champaran district and was shown as arrested there. Meghen told the court that he was taken blindfolded from place to place in cars, he added.         
	We pleaded before the court that his counsel be allowed to remain present during his interrogation and a proper medical examination be conducted to which the court agreed. His counsel will not interrupt the interrogation process. His health condition has deteriorated as he was taken from place to place without proper food, he said.        
	Suspecting foul play in his fathers arrest, Yaimas son R.K. Chinglen had yesterday said the Centre had announced his arrest in a dramatic way from Bihar on Tuesday after illegally detaining him for a couple of months.         
	The UNLF is the oldest rebel group in Manipur and has been fighting for the states separation from India. Yaima is a member of Manipurs royal family. His arrest is a big blow to the outfit, many of whose top leaders, including vice-president Tomba Singh and secretary Joy Singh, are already behind bars.

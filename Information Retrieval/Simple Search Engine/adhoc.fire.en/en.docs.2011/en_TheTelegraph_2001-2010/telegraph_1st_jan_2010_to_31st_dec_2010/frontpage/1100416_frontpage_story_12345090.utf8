The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Some friends dubious, says ex
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Some friends dubious, says ex
  - Sunandas former husband blames lifestyle, corrects mistakes          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                                Sunanda Pushkar      
	Mumbai, April 15: Sunanda Pushkars first husband says her dubious friends and inclination for a high-profile lifestyle had pulled them apart.        
	Her friends were not people I could identify with some even seemed dubious to me. Anyway, it is from a long time back and belongs to a part of my life I have thrown out of the window, Sanjay Raina, a Delhi-based VJ who is currently in Australia, told The Telegraph.        
	He said he could prove that contrary to reports and claims by Sunanda, it was he who had divorced her and not the other way round.        
	I do not want to defame her. But if I feel the need, I may come out and speak to the media about a few things, he said.        
	Raina made an appeal for privacy, saying: Understandably, I have been inundated with media calls. But please do appreciate that after my divorce with Sunanda, I moved on and remarried. I want to protect my wife and child from the media lens.        
	But he was keen to correct bits of information that have been published about him and his ex-wife. For one, I am not the father of her 13-year-old child. We separated in the mid-80s within a couple of years of our marriage. So, a simple (calculation) will prove that the child is not mine, he said.        
	Soon after her divorce, Sunanda, 48, married a Dubai-based businessman from Kerala, Sujit Menon.        
	The couple shifted to Dubai, where Sujit organised a Malayalam superstars show that turned out to be a financial disaster for him. Sujit returned home to Kerala alone and later met a tragic end in an accident in Delhi. Sunanda moved to Toronto for some time and later returned to the UAE where she now stays, said a Mumbai-based fashion designer who knows Sunanda.

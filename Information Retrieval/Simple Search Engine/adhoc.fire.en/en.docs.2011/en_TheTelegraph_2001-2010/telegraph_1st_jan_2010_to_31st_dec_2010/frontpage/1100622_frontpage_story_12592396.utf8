                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Maoist effect on UN mission
  - IAF seeks nod to recall choppers, army mulls deputing colonels to states         SUJAN DUTTA                                                    
	New Delhi, June 21: The Indian Air Force (IAF) has sought permission to pull out its helicopters with UN missions in Africa, and the Indian Army has proposed deputing colonels to state governments in response to repeated calls from the home ministry for military help in tackling Naxalites, defence ministry sources have confirmed to The Telegraph.        
	In effect, the Naxalite upsurge across the central and eastern parts of the country is now beginning to take a toll on Indias international commitments. The IAF had deployed its helicopters for UN missions because most other countries refused to do so.        
	The defence ministry has written to the external affairs ministry that the IAFs assets in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Sudan  17 Mi-17 multi-utility helicopters and eight Mi-35 and Mi-25 attack helicopter gunships  must be de-inducted and brought back for internal security duties, a senior defence ministry source said.        
	The defence ministry has requested the external affairs ministry  which liases with the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (UNDPKO)  that India should not renew the letter of assist (LoA) that it has given for the UN missions in Congo and Sudan.        
	Simultaneously, in a separate move, army headquarters has also informed the defence ministry that officers of the rank of colonel  all of whom have had experience as commanding officers of battalions in counter-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast  can be deputed to Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh for operational advice in battlefield tactics as central and state security forces seek to hunt down Maoists.        
	The armys proposal follows not only requests from the home ministry but also its refusal to deploy troops to neutralise improvised explosive devices  a task, the army says, can only be carried out with deployments for area domination that can involve tens of thousands of troops.        
	Colonels with battlefield experience will bring their operational expertise to the state-wise planning of the counter-Naxalite operations and should be expected to fill a crucial gap in tactics.         
	Too few Indian Police Service officers have an exposure to battlefield tactics and senior police officers are also not as used to leading troops from the front in grinding routine as unlike army officers are, a senior army officer said, explaining the rationale.        
	The army, which has trained more than 50,000 state and central police forces for counter-Naxalite duties so far, is also insisting that IPS officers in Maoist areas be trained in jungle warfare before being inducted into specific tasks.        
	One senior army officer pointed to the example of a Rajput regiment officer, Colonel Rajnish Sharma, being chosen to head a Special Task Force (STF) by the Chhattisgarh government two years back. The STF in Chhattisgarh, he said, has fared much better than the other central and state police outfits, almost on a par with the Andhra Greyhounds.        
	The deputation of colonels to the state governments was also unlikely to create controversies in the hierarchies of the respective administrations. The warrant of precedence that lays down the ranks of military officers and their civilian equivalents, is valid only up to general officer ranks. A lieutenant general is equivalent to an additional secretary/director-general of police and a major general to a joint secretary/commissioner of police.        
	Placing an officer of the rank of colonel, therefore, it is reasoned, should not disrupt the rank structure in the field areas for internal security.        
	The military adviser in the home ministry, a post created by P. Chidambaram, is a brigadier, a notch above a colonel. The post is currently held by Brigadier D.S. Dadwal.        
	The drawdown of IAF assets from Africa will take between one and three months, an air headquarters source told The Telegraph.        
	The IAF has six Mi-17s (Equatorial Eagles) and four Mi-35 (Firebirds) in Goma and five Mi-17s and four Mi-25s (Vipers) in Bukavu in the Democratic Republic of Congo.         
	The IAF was inducted in to enforce the peace in the civil war-riven African country in 2003. IAF special forces (Garud) and about 450 air warriors are also with the UN mission in Congo.        
	In Kadugali in South Central Sudan, the IAF has deployed six M-17s and 196 air warriors since January this year. India also has strategic interests in impoverished and war-torn Sudan, where Chinese commercial ventures have a large presence.

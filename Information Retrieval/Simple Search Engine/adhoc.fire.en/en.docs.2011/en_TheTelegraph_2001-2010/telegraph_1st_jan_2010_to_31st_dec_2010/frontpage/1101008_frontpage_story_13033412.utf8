The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Fudge finger at BEd regulator
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Fudge finger at BEd regulator
  - Charge of clearing ill-equipped institutes         BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                                     
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: The chairman of the central body that monitors teachers education and BEd courses has been indicted for clearing private institutes lacking basic facilities.        
	Mohammad Akhtar Siddiqui, who heads the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), has been found guilty by an HRD ministry panel of fudging records that enabled the Innovative Institute of Education and Technology at Noida, near Delhi, to run BEd courses despite being ill-equipped to do so.        
	The Congress MP from Andhra Pradeshs Amalapuram, Harsha Kumar, had lodged a complaint of corruption and nepotism against Siddiqui last year with anti-corruption watchdog, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).         
	The ministry had appointed A.K. Singh, a joint secretary in the department, to probe the allegations on a directive from the CVC. The panel submitted its report on Monday.         
	Kumar had alleged that the NCTEs expert committees, which carry out inspections of colleges to run BEd courses, gave false reports about the Noida institute and others, helping them get recognition.        
	Kumar said in his complaint that the NCTE had allowed Innovative Institute to run such courses even though it did not have the required built-up area and other related infrastructure. The inquiry found that the chairman had manipulated the reports of the inspection team.        
	The committee has held the chairman guilty of the charges, an official source said.         
	The inquiry committee also found that Siddiqui had not disclosed before a selection committee of the HRD ministry at the time of his appointment that he was facing criminal cases. Candidates are supposed to disclose their antecedents before being considered for such jobs.        
	The ministry, headed by Congresss Kapil Sibal who has made education reforms a priority, will study the report and decide whether a departmental probe should be initiated against Siddiqui.        
	But Kumar, the Amalapuram MP, wants the government to crack the whip. I have demanded appropriate action against Siddiqui. I hope the ministry does it so the NCTE operates in a fair manner, he said.        
	Asked about the indictment, Siddiqui claimed he did not know about the inquiry. No, I do not know what this inquiry is, he said and declined to take further questions.        
	This is not the first case involving a top official of an education regulator. A former head of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), which recognises technical and management colleges, was suspended last year for clearing ill-equipped private engineering institutes in return for bribes.

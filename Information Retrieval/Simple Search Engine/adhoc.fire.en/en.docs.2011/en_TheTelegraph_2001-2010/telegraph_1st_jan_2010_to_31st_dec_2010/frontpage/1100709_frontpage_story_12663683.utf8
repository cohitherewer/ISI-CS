  - As Cup approaches the final, a flashback to total football                                  
	If the Netherlands beat Spain in the World Cup final in Soccer City on Sunday, they will surpass the achievements of all the outstanding Dutch teams who have gone before.        
	That includes the Ruud Gullit/Marco van Basten side that won the European Championship in 1988 as well as the two sides that finished runners-up in the World Cup in 1974 and 1978.        
	Looking back with todays perspective, a casual observer of the game might think the two teams of the 1970s were similarly built and styled. Nothing could be further from the truth. The 1978 side was a pale, disciplined, hard-working shadow of the imaginative creation from four years earlier.        
	Two significant differences existed. First, the great Johan Cruyff, inspirational wandering centre-forward and captain in 1974, had retired from the national team six months before the 1978 finals; second, the team of 1978 followed a formal tactical pattern imposed by short-term manager Ernst Happel, while the Class of 74 was a far superior creation altogether.        
	Indeed, it may be argued that  even if, as noted, the Dutch beat Spain in Soccer City on Sunday  the latest version of the Oranje will not compare with the 1974 legends.        
	The story of that team runs back to the early 1950s, before floodlights and jet travel had put wings  literally  beneath the yet-to-be-founded European Champions Cup and all its worldwide derivations and copies.        
	An Austrian exile from the Nazis, named Willy Meisl, had escaped to England before the outbreak of the Second World War and was an outstanding international sports correspondent for newspapers and magazines in both Britain and, later, back in Austria and Germany.        
	Increasingly frustrated by English naivety about international football, he sought to write a book for the English, putting into perspective their place in the modern game. The book was called Football Revolution: it remains a seminal piece of sports writing.              
	In one of the later chapters, Meisl looked ahead and assessed how the game would develop. He expected superior levels of fitness and physical preparation combined with vastly improved technique.        
	This would create a foundation for teams whose players would be able to interchange positions at will; the old notions of fixed positions (centre-forward, centre-back, winger, fullback etc) would be obsolete.        
	That concept was brought to life in the late 1960s by a Dutchman, Rinus Michels. Once an international centre-forward, Michels had progressed to become coach of his old club, Ajax Amsterdam: simultaneously the club, by luck more than judgement, assembled a remarkable generation of young players who had skill, versatility, football intelligence and enormous self-confidence.        
	Michels moulded these players into the nearest imitation of The Whirl the game has ever seen. Versatility was the hallmark of players such as nominal leftback Rudi Krol, centre-back Horst Blankenburg, midfielders Gerrie Muhren, Arie Haan and Johan Neeskens plus goalscoring wingers Johnny Rep and Piet Keizer.        
	Krol, for example, could forge forward from leftback and stay up in attack, confident that Muhren or Neeskens or Keizer would drop back to cover his zone. Same story elsewhere all over the pitch. A Dutch journalist, thrilled at following Ajaxs hattrick of Champions Cup victories, named the style total football.        
	In 1973, it began to fall apart with Cruyffs transfer from Ajax to Barcelona.        
	A year later, he and his old club-mates were reunited in the Dutch national side who reached the 1974 World Cup final. They were favourites, too, but the sin of arrogance tumbled them to defeat despite an ideal start with a second-minute penalty award from English referee Jack Taylor.        
	Hence todays successors  the likes of Wesley Sneijder, Robin Van Persie, Arjen Robben and Mark Van Bommel, under coach Bert Van Marwijk  can exorcise the spectre of that famous failure and go where even footballs greatest Dutch masters could not.        
	But if any of todays teams are superstitious, they may just have felt one icy frisson yesterday evening when Fifa named the referee for the final: Howard Webb, first Englishman so honoured since Jack Taylor in 1974.

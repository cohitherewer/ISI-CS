                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CM plea to PM on Tagore paintings
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Lady with a Fan by Tagore                                  
	Calcutta, May 19: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has written to the Prime Minister requesting him to take measures to bring to India 12 Tagore paintings set to be auctioned by Sothebys in London on June 15.        
	It has recently come to my notice that Tagores paintings presented to Leonard Elmhirst by the poet himself have been planned to be put on auction by Sothebys at London on June 15, 2010. This news deeply disturbed us. These Elmhirst collections of Gurudevs paintings are priceless treasures of Indian culture, the chief ministers letter said.        
	Bhattacharjee added that the Centre should take all necessary steps to bring these paintings back to India. I shall be grateful if you issue appropriate direction.        
	The 12 paintings belong to the Dartington Hall estate in South Devon and have a combined pre-sale estimate of 250,000. The estate had been purchased in the 1920s by the Englishman, a close friend of Tagore, and his wife, the American heiress Dorothy Whitney Elmhirst.         
	Tagore visited Dartington a number of times. Apart from the paintings, it holds a huge archive of photographs, letters and other ephemera relating to Tagore.        
	In a letter, Leonard wrote: One day, he (Tagore) asked for bottles of coloured ink, and, when these arrived, there began to emerge a series of paintings and sketches.        
	The works include a portrait of a woman, a woman with a fan, a figure in black with a bare arm and a green background and a landscape in yellow, black, blue and green. Tagore used watercolour, coloured ink and pastel.        
	Sothebys said the paintings have remained in the collection at Dartington for some 71 years. The Dartington Hall Trust has, however, been unable to display the works due to space limitations, it added.        
	Asked if there is a demand for Tagores paintings in the international market, Helen Collier and Holly Brackenbury of Sothebys wrote back in an email: Tagores art does have a wide international following. His work is rare to the auction market but when works by him have appeared on the international auction market in recent years, weve seen interest and competitive bidding from the West as well as India.        
	Ketaki Kusari Dyson, who specialises in Tagores art, said in a telephone interview from her home in UK: It would be a great pity if the pictures were scattered all over the world. I think they should stay together as a collection and be acquired by a gallery where they can be kept in proper conditions and be viewed by the public. I sincerely hope that target will be achieved.        
	She added that the Indian government should try to acquire them while their price was relatively low.         
	Till this evening, Union culture secretary Jawhar Sircar has not received any instruction from the Prime Ministers Office.        
	Kalyan Kundu, the founder chairman of Tagore Centre in London, stressed that Dartington Hall was within its rights to put the paintings up for sale. The only solution is the Indian government bidding for them. He said Dartington Hall had assured him that it would take good care of the rest of the archival material.        
	The Dartington Hall Trust has a series of events planned in 2011 to celebrate the 150th birth centenary of Tagore.

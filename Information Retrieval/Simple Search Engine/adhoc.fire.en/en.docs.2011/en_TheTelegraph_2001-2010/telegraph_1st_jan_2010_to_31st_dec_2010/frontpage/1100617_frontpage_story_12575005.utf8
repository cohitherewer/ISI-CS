The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | History that hurts sits on stunned Spain 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                History that hurts sits on stunned Spain 
  - Cup needs an upset, giants a reminder										                            Spain rsquo;s Gerard Pique on the ground   as Switzerland rsquo;s Gelson Fernandes goes  for the ball to score. (Reuters)                          
	No country has ever won the World Cup after losing the first match. That is the negative weight of history which sits now on the shoulders of Spain after their upset at the hands of Switzerland. Forget about the roar of the vuvuzelas, lets hear cheers for the tinkle of Swiss cow bells.        
	Every World Cup needs an early upset. Its good for the giants of the game to be reminded of their fragility. Not, it might be argued, that Spain needed much reminding of the hidden dangers lurking in South Africa: the European champions still remember all too well the pain of their defeat by the US in the semi-finals of the Confederations Cup here in South Africa last year.        
	The story of the sinking of the latest Spanish armada is easily told. Advancing defender Gerard Pique missed an early chance and then fell over his feet in confusion early in the second half when Gelson Fernandes put the Swiss ahead. Indeed, a split-second earlier the Swiss might have had a penalty but the ball was in the net before English referee Howard Webb had had time to put his whistle to his lips.        
	Xabi Alonso rattled the bar for Spain and Erek Derdiyok trembled a post for Switzerland, so these two European nations were equal on near-misses. Spain had far more of the game but lacked finesse in and around the goal area. David Villa may be costing Barcelona 30 million euros this summer from Valencia but he did not bring shooting boots appropriate to his reputation and value.        
	Villa is one of those frustrating players who can score a hat-trick one day and put six easy chances over the bar some other day. This was one of those other days.                                 
	Villas failure to rise to the occasion was all the more unfortunate because Fernando Torres was missing.        
	To be more precise: the Liverpool man, who is not truly match fit after recovering recently from knee surgery, did not start the game and, when he was thrown on in emergency after the hour, made little serious contribution.        
	This was not his fault. Spain raised the tempo of the game, in their desperation, to a level which nullified the thoughtful context of football in which midfielders Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta excel. Indeed, one criticism pointed at coach Vicente Del Bosque might be that he overstuffed his team with midfielders in Iniesta, Xavi, Alonso, Sergi Bosquets and David Silva.        
	That was showing Switzerland too much respect. Opening matches are nervy affairs, given the fear of initial defeat and all its consequences. But Spain are European champions with more class and talent in any four or five of their players than exist in the entire Swiss squad of 23.        
	They had nothing to fear and everything to gain. A four-goal victory, say, such as that achieved by Germany, would have sent out a very powerful  not to say intimidating  message to the likes of title rivals such as Brazil (two goals) and Argentina (one goal), never mind to England, France and Italy who could not even claim a win between them.        
	Del Bosques dilemma is shared by Dunga and Diego Maradona with Brazil and Argentina as well as by Fabio Capello, to a lesser extent, with England. All four managers have more outstanding midfielders than they can use. The risk is the very easy mistake of choosing the wrong ones: thus Capello will always pick both Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard even though they run in the same channels.        
	Del Bosque, with Spain, has not only the five midfielders he used against Switzerland but Arsenal skipper Cesc Fabregas as well. Its hardly fair. But football is like that sometimes.        
	Just think, to win the Cup for the first time in their own history, Spain will now have to make world football history as well.

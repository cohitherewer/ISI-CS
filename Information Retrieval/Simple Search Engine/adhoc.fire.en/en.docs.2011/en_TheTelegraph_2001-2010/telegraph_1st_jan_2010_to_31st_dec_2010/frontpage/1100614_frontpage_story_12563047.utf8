The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP smells Naveen in Nitish
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                BJP smells Naveen in Nitish
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	Patna, June 13: The BJP thinks Nitish Kumar might do a Naveen Patnaik and pull out of the Bihar coalition before the Assembly elections after the first serious rupture in its relations with the Janata Dal (United) over Narendra Modi.        
	While the BJP has decided not to exacerbate the breach, it is also unlikely to put itself out to salvage the alliance and accede to Nitishs terms. It will throw its weight behind the Gujarat chief minister.        
	The approach was encapsulated in spokesman Rajiv Pratap Rudys response that was crafted after several rounds of talks.        
	Rudy said: We are a mature party, with a mature leadership that shows a great sense of resilience. But our self-respect is most important.         
	BJP chief Nitin Gadkari said: We will follow coalition dharma but with self-respect.        
	The stress on self-respect was reflected in Rudys defence of Modi: He is a leader and a successful chief minister. He is hailed by his supporters for the way he is ruling Gujarat and some overzealous ones among them have made efforts to widen his appeal by showing the truth (in the Modi ads that angered Nitish).        
	Although Modi has more than his share of detractors in the BJP, the party rallied round him after Nitish called the ads uncultured, unethical. Nitishs apologists in the party were told to get off when they sued for peace. Before Gadkari took a view, the local MLAs insisted the BJP must not yield to Nitish.        
	An MLA from north Bihar said that after the episode, the workers in his constituency phoned to requisition 10 instead of the original two buses to ferry people to the Patna rally on Sunday.         
	There is tremendous enthusiasm for Modi, he told Gadkari.        
	The Rashtriya Swabhimaan (national pride) rally had morphed into a Modi Swabhimaan one, the MLAs said.        
	Asked if Modi could deliver Bihar to the BJP if its relations with the Dal (United) were over, a state leader said: Thats not the point. If Modi becomes negotiable today, tomorrow we will be told you will get only 50 seats.        
	A section of the BJP is convinced Nitish is preparing for a go solo line. A normally cautious person like him would not have made extreme statements had he not already decided he was better off without us.         
	Patnaik, the Orissa chief minister, had taken a calculated risk when he sundered ties with the BJP on election eve after the communal baggage from Kandhamal got too heavy to carry. BJP sources said a similar consideration might weigh with Nitish.        
	But while Patnaik faced no state-level rivals, Nitish has formidable adversaries in Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan.

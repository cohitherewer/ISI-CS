	Leh, Aug 17 (PTI): India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Tuesday announced a Rs 125 crore relief packaged for the Leh cloudburst victims and said all houses destroyed by the natural calamity will be reconstructed within the next two-and-a-half months.
    Singh, who arrived here on a day-long visit to take stock of relief and rehabilitation undertaken in the aftermath of flash floods in this mountainous region, said that the relief will be given from the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund.
    The Indian Prime Minister said that houses destroyed in the Leh cloudburst will be rebuilt within the next two-and-a-half months and funds will not be a problem.
    "Hospital, school, electricity connections and roads will be rebuilt and all rehabilitation works will be completed within the next two-and-a-half months and before the onset of winter. Funds will not be a problem," he said.

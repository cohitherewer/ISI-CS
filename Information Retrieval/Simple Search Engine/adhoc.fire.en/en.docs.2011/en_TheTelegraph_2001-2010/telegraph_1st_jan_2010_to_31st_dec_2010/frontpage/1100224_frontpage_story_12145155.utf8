          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 23: The IG in charge of the region covering the Shilda camp has been transferred, a day after the state government made him part of a panel to probe the Maoist attack and fix accountability.        
	Kuldiep Singh, the inspector-general of police (western zone), was transferred as part of a process to tone up the police administration in Maoist-hit districts, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said today.        
	Sen is also part of the three-member panel, the composition of which had drawn fire because the fact-finders themselves have been accused of lapses that hampered retaliation when Maoist rebels attacked the Eastern Frontier Rifles (EFR) camp and killed 24 policemen last week.        
	Singh will now cease to be part of the inquiry committee. He should not be there (on the committee), now that he has been transferred, Sen said.        
	The home secretary said the transfer was routine in nature. More transfers were announced today, including that of the DIG (Midnapore range), Peeyush Pandey. But Pandeys shift to the Special Protection Group in Delhi had been cleared before the Maoist attack on the EFR camp.        
	Singh will now swap places with the inspector-general (administration), Zulfikar Hasan. Anil Kumar, DIG (railways), will take over as DIG (Midnapore range).        
	Now that Hasan has been appointed IG, western zone, he will be inducted into the committee instead of Singh. This will also make the committee more impartial as no one can accuse Hasan of lapses in the Shilda attack case, an official said.        
	Home department sources said that as IG, western zone, Singh was the overall in-charge of the police administration. So, he was a party to the decision to relocate the EFR camp from the safer confines of the irrigation department to the unsafe location under pressure from the CPM.        
	Although Singhs transfer is being considered a punishment in police circles, some were seeing it as a blessing in disguise.         
	Few officers want to be posted in a high-stress zone like West Midnapore. Now he can be at peace in his Calcutta posting, an officer said.

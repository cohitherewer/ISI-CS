          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today sent a grim message to senior leaders who indulge in lobbying for personal aggrandisement even after getting adequately rewarded for their work.        
	Coming just before the possibility of a shuffle in the party and the government, her blunt remark has rattled several ministers and AICC office-bearers.        
	In her closing remarks at the plenary this evening, Sonia said: While some people have been adequately rewarded for their work, others have got nothing, neither in the government nor in the party. Still, they have dedicated themselves to party work. These people have a special place in my heart. Those who have been rewarded should learn from these workers. Selfless service has its unique importance.         
	Such strong words are often spoken to lift party workers morale but this time, they are being interpreted as a message to those who cling on to positions.        
	Having addressed the prime concern of corruption yesterday, Sonia today shifted focus to her biggest organisational anxiety as dislodging seniors from their posts has been a tricky task. She has so far felt constrained to retain most of the faces that became part of the high command structure over the past 12 years.        
	But the party is in a transitional phase with Rahul Gandhis ascendance. Sonia, too, has given clear indications that she would undertake an overhaul to prepare a new team for the future.        
	While many veteran Congress leaders are expected to be shown the door from both the working committee and the Union cabinet, the principle of one-man-one-post also needs to be implemented. All these changes will take place within a month or so.        
	The Congress president underscored the need for hard work and mass contact, realising that many leaders had been rewarded, by Sonia herself, for networking and loyalty. Digvijay Singh had yesterday requested her to force senior leaders to reach out to the masses.        
	Sonia said in her valedictory address that Congress workers must not nurture any doubt about the partys record and should have no hesitation in confronting political opponents aggressively.        
	She expressed the hope that the Prime Minister would work on her action plan to fight corruption.

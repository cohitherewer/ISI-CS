	Ranchi, Sept. 9: The BJPs Arjun Munda will be sworn in Jharkhands eighth chief minister on the auspicious occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi and Id on September 11 with Governor M.. H. Farook asking him to prove his majority in the Assembly within a week of assuming office.        
	The governors invitation to Munda came soon after the Union cabinet approved revocation of Presidents rule in the state today.         
	The BJP leader, accompanied by leaders of his alliance, Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto and JMM legislature party leader Hemant Soren, met Farook at Raj Bhavan and freezed on the date and time of his choice: 11.30 am, Saturday, September 11.        
	Since the state Assembly has been under renovation since April, the swearing-in will be held at Birsa Mandap in Raj Bhavan on Saturday, by which time President Pratibha Patil, on a 10-day trip to Laos and Combodia, is expected to give her assent to the Union cabinet decision.        
	Munda may not need seven days to prove his majority. Though the deadline is September 17, Munda is ready to face the floor test on September 14, a source close to Speaker C.P. Singh said.        
	September 11 is convenient for Munda. One it is Ganesh Chaturthi  also, Id will be celebrated that day.         
	Most important, BJP president Nitin Gadkari, is supposed to return from Russia the day before, enabling him to be in Ranchi to attend the swearing-in of a government he helped put in place by throwing his weight behind Mundas efforts in the face of opposition from senior party leaders like L.K. Advani and Sushma Swaraj.         
	Munda is now getting in touch with other senior party leaders, including Rajnath Singh, to request them to attend Saturdays swearing-in.        
	The foremost task of my government will be to provide relief to villagers presently under distress due to drought, Munda said soon after meeting Farook at Raj Bhavan.        
	Maintaining law and order will be the second priority as without peace, development has no meaning, he said, indicating he was already chalking out plans to tackle Maoists who have a well-entrenched network in as many as 18 of 24 districts of Jharkhand.        
	Munda promised a transparent government and added that improving basic infrastructure, including good roads and dependable electricity, would be another thrust area, while execution of several Centre as well as state projects would be speeded up. Public welfare projects will continue to take place in an effective manner. People will really feel the difference, he asserted.

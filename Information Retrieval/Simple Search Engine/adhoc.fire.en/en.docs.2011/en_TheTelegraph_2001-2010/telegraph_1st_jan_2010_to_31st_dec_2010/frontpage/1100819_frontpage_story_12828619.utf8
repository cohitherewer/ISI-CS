	Ranchi, Aug. 18: An eight-member central team, led by director of National Horticulture Board Bijay Kumar, arrived here today and undertook a quick tour of the state capitals outskirts to get an early feel of the dry conditions before settling down for a meeting with Governor M..H. Farook on the extent of drought in Jharkhand.         
	The eight-member team will split into two groups and visit Ramgarh, Hazaribagh, Chatra, Giridih, Dhanbad, Bokaro, Lohardaga, Latehar, Palamau, Gumla, Simdega, Khunti, West Singhbhum and East Singhbhum tomorrow and Friday to assess the ground situation.         
	On Saturday, the team will hold another meeting with state authorities and hopefully reveal their mind about the extent of relief measures it would be proposing.        
	A.M. Thakur, the deputy secretary in the disaster management department that is coordinating drought demands with the Centre, told The Telegraph the team would also inspect irrigation projects and implementation of central schemes like ICDS, midday meal and MGNREGS during field visits.         
	Today, after alighting at Birsa Munda Airport, the team went to Project Building to meet secretaries of various departments that would be coordinating relief measures for the next couple of months.         
	Disaster management department secretary M.N. Kerketta briefed the team about various demands for relief and presented satellite data with respect to sowing of paddy, vegetative index and soil moisture content.         
	The team also visited farm areas of Kanke, Sukurhutu and Ratu on the outskirts before meeting Farook and his advisers at Raj Bhavan in the evening. During their interaction, sources said, the governor is understood to have told the team that Jharkhand was reeling under drought for the second consecutive year and it should be given due assistance by the Centre.        
	Official figures suggest that so far, the Kharif season has recorded only 29 per cent sowing of paddy with a rain deficit of around 50 per cent.         
	The state administration sent a memorandum of assistance to the tune of Rs 1,767.75 crore to the Union ministry of agriculture early this week for 16 districts. This was besides Rs 390 crore available with the state under calamity relief fund (CRF).         
	More funds would be sought for the remaining eight districts which were declared drought hit a couple of days back, said Thakur.         
	Control room        
	The disaster management departments control room and helpline to coordinate relief measures have started functioning. The number is : 0651-1070.

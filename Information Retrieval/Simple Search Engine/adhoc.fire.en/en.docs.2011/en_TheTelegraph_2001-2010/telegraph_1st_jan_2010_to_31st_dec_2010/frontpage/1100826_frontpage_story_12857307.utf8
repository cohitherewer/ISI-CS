The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Apang calls arrest a blessing
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Apang calls arrest a blessing
          ATONU CHOUDHURRI                                    
	Itanagar, Aug. 25: An unfazed Gegong Apang today termed his arrest on corruption charges a blessing in disguise, musing on the times he found solace in cultivation to escape from political reversals.        
	I have demanded a CBI inquiry, which I strongly feel can exonerate me from false charges. I have nothing to say against the party but only a handful of persons tried to isolate me and damage my image. No one can finish me off. Aam janta is on my side. Their support is my strength, the former Arunachal Pradesh chief minister said, a day after his sudden arrest from the special investigation cell office in Itanagar for his alleged involvement in a public distribution system scam.         
	Wearing blue jeans and white T-shirt, Apang sat in his Deluxe B room of Ramakrishna Mission Hospital, where he was admitted last night when his health deteriorated after a sessions court in Lakhimpur (Assam) sent him to seven days in police custody.        
	My long experience in politics and life taught me to take refuge in farming, he said.        
	I have a farm and I used to take refuge in cultivation at times from the hackneyed world but still I am a public leader. The leader in me never allows me to call it quits. I have been a popular public figure and would always love to serve the public as a leader, he added, after a light home-cooked meal.         
	A bevy of Apangs supporters gathered outside the hospital, the general secretary of Arunachal PCC, T.C. Tok, being one of them.        
	A family friend tied a thread, locally called ridin, as a mark of blessing, on his wrist.         
	A politician like me never dies. I have lived my life like a king and I will come back. I am neither down nor out but subdued somewhat but I am no stranger to adversities, neither cowed down by any hurdles. I formed a close association with the Congress party since my boyhood and had a very deep bond with the Gandhi family. I have a sympathy wave in my favour. Many top Congressmen from New Delhi and across the country expressed their sympathy after I was unduly arrested yesterday. This is sure to turn out to be a blessing in disguise for me, Apang said.         
	The former chief minister, who ruled the state for nearly 23 years, reposed his faith in destiny.         
	My destiny helped me rise to eminence from grassroots as I did not have family lineage to back my political career. I am an ardent believer in destiny and I have peoples love on my side in this hour. I had a topsy-turvy life for nearly two years but every time life posed a challenge to me, I came out unscathed, he added.        
	Apang said he was in touch with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, who allotted a room for him for his stay in New Delhi yesterday but he failed to make the trip because of the arrest.         
	As Apang spoke, security men guarding his hospital room rudely interrupted.         
	This correspondent had entered Apangs room only after obtaining permission from the investigating officer of special investigation cell, M.S. Chauhan.         
	But when the securitymen called Chauhan, he denied having granted permission, leading police to detain this correspondent for some time.

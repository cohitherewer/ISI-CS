  - Monitoring gadget lies unused        RUDRA BISWAS                             Albert Ekka Chowk, one of four location choices                                        
	Ranchi, March 26: For more than six months now, the state government has failed to allot a plot of land, about 200sqm, to the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board to install an ambient air quality monitoring station in Ranchi.         
	The equipment, procured by Tata Steel, is to be installed at a prominent place in the state capital to monitor levels of seven major air pollutants  carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, benzene, toluene, xylene and ozone.        
	The station is also meant to provide meteorological data, including wind speed and direction, temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation.         
	The ambient air quality monitoring station will also display online data with simultaneous transmission to the state pollution control office at Dhurwa and the Central Pollution Control Board, New Delhi.         
	More than six months ago, Tata Steel had written to the Jharkhand State Pollution Control board (JSPCB) informing it about having procured the ambient air quality monitoring equipment that needed to be installed on a plot of land, around 20 metres x 10 metres.        
	We have already procured the ambient air quality monitoring station. We are awaiting clearance from JSPCB so that we can set up the station at the earliest on land designated for the purpose, Avinash Prasad, the chief resident executive of Tata Steel, said.         
	This prompted JSPCB to write to the deputy commissioner as well as commissioner, South Chhotanagpur division, asking them to allot land at any prominent place in the state capital for the purpose of monitoring air quality.         
	The JPSCB also suggested a few locations  SSP office at Kutcherry Road, somewhere near Albert Ekka Chowk, Sainik Bazaar or Kantatoli Chowk, all busy intersections where air and noise pollution are at their peak since they are used by hundreds of vehicles every day.         
	JSPCB member secretary R.K. Sinha said while granting pollution clearance for Tata Steels expansion project in Jamshedpur, the board had sought the companys help in installing an air quality monitoring station at Ranchi.         
	He said ever since the Tatas informed him about the equipment, he has been writing to the Ranchi deputy commissioner as well as the commissioner, South Chhotanagpur sub-division about a plot.        
	We are waiting for the state government to allot us land, Sinha said.         
	Ranchi deputy commissioner K.K. Soan, however, said he wasnt aware of any letter requirement of land from the state pollution control board. I cannot comment on an issue about which I am not aware, he told The Telegraph.        
	The reality is that the list of those waiting for land to be allotted by the state government has been growing steadily since the last seven years.                     
	At least 71 entrepreneurs, who had inked MOUs with the state government pledging an investment of nearly Rs 2,96,000 crore for various industrial projects since 2003 are still waiting for the state to allot them land.        
	A rough estimates drawn up by the state industries department indicate a requirement of more than 99,000 acre.         
	Even the Roman Catholic Church has now been waiting for more than a year for the state government to allot it around 300 acre for setting up a medical college, a 500-bed hospital along with a composite university that would include a law school, engineering college, post graduate and under graduate colleges.

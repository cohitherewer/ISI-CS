          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: Delhi High Court today sought to beam a burst of unwelcome sunlight into the portals of the Supreme Court, rejecting the highest courts plea against opening the Chief Justice of Indias office to public scrutiny under the Right to Information Act.        
	Sunlight is the best disinfectant, the high court told its superior court, adding that the judiciary could not buck the global trend towards openness.        
	Giving the most powerful court a lesson in democratic principles, the three-judge bench said: The source of the right to information does not emanate from the RTI Act it emerges from constitutional guarantees under Article 19(1)(a). Its overreaching purpose is to facilitate democracy by ensuring that citizens have the information required to participate meaningfully in the democratic process and to help (make) the governors accountable to the governed.        
	The high court added: In construing such a statute, the court ought to give to it the widest operation.        
	The Supreme Court, however, has decided to challenge the judgment by filing an appeal with itself, PTI added. If the court now decides the case in its own favour, it would hardly boost its image at a time public opinion is overwhelmingly in favour of transparency.        
	On September 2 last year, a single-judge high court bench had upheld an RTI applicants petition that asked whether Supreme Court judges do declare their assets.        
	The apex court, echoing the CJIs stand that the ruling would end up eroding the judiciarys independence, had appealed against the order before the three-judge bench  making judicial history since the high court is lower than it in the pecking order.        
	The larger bench had granted a stay but today its 88-page judgment offered the apex court little sympathy.        
	The high court shrugged off the Supreme Courts fears that by its logic, notes or jottings by judges or their draft judgments too would fall within the purview of the RTI.        
	Notes taken by judges while hearing a case cannot be treated as final views expressed by them. They are meant only for their (own) use and cannot be held to be a part of a record held by the public authority, it said.        
	However, if the judge turns in the notes along with the rest of his files to be maintained as records, they may be disclosed. The mere marking of a document as confidential would not override the binding provisions of the RTI.        
	The most damaging observations came in relation to the apex courts stand on two resolutions it had itself taken many years ago. One mandated an ethical code for judges and the other asked them to reveal their assets annually.         
	The Supreme Court had contended that such resolutions were not binding, but the high court said the argument could not be accepted if proper functioning of the judiciary as an institution has to be ensured.

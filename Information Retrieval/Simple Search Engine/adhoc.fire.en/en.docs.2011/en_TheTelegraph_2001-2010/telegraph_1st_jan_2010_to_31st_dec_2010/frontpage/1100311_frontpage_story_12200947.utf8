The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bedlam over CBI probe
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bedlam over CBI probe
          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, March 10: The Assembly was on the boil today with the Opposition creating a ruckus over the governments refusal to seek a CBI probe into various corruption cases that have brought disrepute to Jharkhand, including the Rs 2000 crore Madhu Koda money laundering case and another one involving a Singapore firm in 2005 when deputy chief minister Raghubar Das was urban development minister in the NDA government of Arjun Munda.        
	No official businesses, like question hour, zero hour or call attention motion, could be taken up during the first half amid the pandemonium at the behest of Opposition members who trooped into the well at least thrice, besides attempting a parallel assembly with JVM (P) senior member Samresh Singh as pro tem speaker.         
	Joining the clamour for a CBI probe was JVM MLA Pradeep Yadav who raked up the Meinhardt scandal with Das as his obvious target.        
	Meinhardt, a Singapore-based company, was asked to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the state capitals sewage and drainage system for a whopping Rs 21.4 crore but the project was a non-starter. Das was then urban development minister in the Munda government of 2004-2005.        
	Jamshedpur (west) MLA Banna Gupta demanded a probe into what he alleged were acts of omission and commission in the Tata lease over Jamshedpur, while Yadav also spoke out against the allotment of iron ore and other mines to various companies in violation of norms.        
	Even Geeta Koda, the Jagannathpur MLA and wife of jailed former chief minister Koda, joined the chorus for a CBI probe.        
	Opposition MLAs also demanded that Kodas diary recovered during income tax and enforcement directorate raids be made public to expose those allegedly involved in the corrupt deals in mining and rural electrification contracts.        
	Soon after Speaker C.P. Singh took the chair at 11am, Opposition MLAs began raising slogans like, Jharkahnd ko ghotalakhand nahi banane denge (We will not allow Jharkhand to become a land of corruption), CBI janch karani hogi (CBI inquiry is a must), among others.         
	Singh tried his best to pacify the MLAs and waited till 12.10pm after which he adjourned the House till 12.45pm.        
	Later, the Speaker rejected the adjournment motion on the CBI probe that had been moved by senior leaders like Yadav, CPI(ML)s Vinod Kumar Singh, Samresh Singh, Phulchand Mandal and Congresss Daltonganj MLA K.N. Tripathi.         
	During the lunch break, Das held a news conference claiming the Oppositions demands were uncalled for.

   Challenge to Ayodhya date
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: The Supreme Court today refused to immediately hear a plea by a former government servant, who is party to a Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit, to defer Fridays high court judgment and give more time to the two sides to arrive at an out-of-court settlement.         
	It will be posted before an appropriate bench, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Altamas Kabir said, when senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi made an out-of-turn mention of Ramesh Chander Tripathis appeal.         
	Technically, it could be posted as early as tomorrow or even Friday morning. The Allahabad High Court judgment is expected in the afternoon.         
	Tripathi, who had made himself a party to one of the pending title suits in 1989 as a devotee of Ram, had earlier moved the high court seeking to have the judgment deferred so that all sides would have more time to negotiate. However, the three-judge bench dismissed his plea on September 17 and slapped costs of Rs 50,000 on him.         
	One judge later dissociated himself from the judgment saying that the costs imposed on Tripathi were too high. Only costs of Rs 3,000 could be imposed, Justice D.V. Sharma said.         
	The judge said Tripathis petition was bona fide and the parties could even arrive at a settlement before September 24. But the other two judges dismissed his plea saying they could not wait till infinity for a settlement on a matter that was pending for nearly 60 years.         
	The high court had listed the judgment for pronouncement after both sides indicated that there was no possibility of arriving at such a settlement. Tripathi had failed to appear before the court that day.         
	In his appeal, Tripathi said the high court had failed to anticipate the ramifications of the September 24 judgment, which could spark violence ahead of the Commonwealth Games.

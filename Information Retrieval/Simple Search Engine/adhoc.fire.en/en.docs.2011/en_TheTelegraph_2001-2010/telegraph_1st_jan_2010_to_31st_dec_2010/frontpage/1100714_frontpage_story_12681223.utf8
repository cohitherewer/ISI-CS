          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 13: You will no longer need to take a day off from office to receive your cooking gas cylinder. It will be delivered at a time of your choosing for an extra Rs 25 or Rs 50  though you may have to wait a few days.        
	The preferred time LPG delivery scheme, launched in Delhi today, will be extended to Calcutta in end-July and will cover the entire country by the end of the year.        
	Under the scheme, you can be a preferred time customer, choosing a particular time slot for cylinder delivery on any day from Monday to Friday. If you miss the delivery by not being at home at the appointed hour, the distributor will deliver the same time next day.        
	Or you can be a preferred day and time customer, selecting a particular time slot on a specific day of the week. If you miss the delivery, you must wait exactly a week.        
	The third category is that of the Saturday/Sunday preferred customer, who receives the cylinder on either of these two days between 8am and 6pm.        
	The time slots and the (extra) charges in the metros are like this (from Monday to Friday): 8am to 11am (Rs 25); 11am to 3pm (Rs 25); 3pm to 6pm (Rs 25); 6pm to 8pm (Rs 50). Theres a fifth slot, before 8am, for which too the charge is Rs 50.        
	How fast can you expect the cylinder once you make a call? Here lies the catch.        
	The system is still first-come, first-served; so you will not receive the cylinder out of turn. After your call matures, the delivery will be made on the next preferred day and time.        
	Suppose you are an 8am-11am preferred time customer and have booked your refill on Saturday, July 3. However, on that day, your distributor may be delivering cylinders booked by customers on Saturday, June 26.        
	After your call matures, say on Wednesday, July 7, you will receive the cylinder on July 8 between 8am and 11am. However, if you are a preferred day and time customer for the 8am-11am slot on Saturdays, you will receive the cylinder only on Saturday, July 10. You must register for the scheme either by filling in a form available with the distributors or by logging into the websites of their respective oil companies.         
	A customer can change her day and time of preference after six months.

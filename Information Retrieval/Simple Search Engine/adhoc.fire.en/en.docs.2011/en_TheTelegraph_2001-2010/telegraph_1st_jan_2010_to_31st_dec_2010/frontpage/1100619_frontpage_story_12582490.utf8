  - Sharad seeks report on cross-voting MLAs          OUR BUREAU                                     
	New Delhi/Ranchi, June 18: The BJP today suspended three of its MLAs for cross voting in  and abstaining from  yesterdays Rajya Sabha polls, but refrained from reacting to the betrayal of two Jharkhand JD(U) MLAs who voted in favour of the JMMs candidate reflecting the unease in the relationship between the two allies.         
	We cannot take action against the JD(U) MLAs, said BJP spokesperson Nirmala Seetharaman on cross-voting by the ally MLAs against BJPs official nominee.         
	Sources, however, said that BJP president Nitin Gadkari would take up the matter with JD(U) president Sharad Yadav as the Jharkhand unit of the party had written a letter to him. When contacted, Yadav said that action against the two MLAs would be decided based on the report from the partys state unit. Let the report come and then we will decide, he told The Telegraph.         
	A top JD(U) leader said that relations between the two allies in Jharkhand had never been good. In the last Lok Sabha polls no BJP leader campaigned for our nominees in Chatra and Daltonganj. The BJP in Jharkhand treats the JD(U) with arrogance. Our state leaders always complain to us, he remarked, adding that the cross voting could be fallout of it.        
	Seetharaman said they had already suspended three MLAs, including Ram Chandra Baitha from Jharkhand, and asked the Rajasthan state unit to hold an inquiry into cancelled votes of two MLAs.         
	The other two suspended BJP MLAs were Banwari Ram (Bihar) and Bhimsen Chaudhury (Orissa).         
	Baitha stayed away from the elections yesterday despite repeated requests by party general secretary and Jamshedpur MP Arjun Munda. This, coupled with the JD(U)s cross-voting, meant that party nominee Ajay Maroo ended up getting only 17 of the 20 votes he was supposed to get.        
	In Ranchi, state BJP spokesperson Sanjay Seth confirmed Baithas suspension. We have received a communiqu from the central leadership to confirm that Baitha has been suspended from the primary membership of the party with immediate effect, he told The Telegraph.        
	BJP state president Raghubar Das, who is unwell in Jamshedpur, is also expected to issue a showcause to Baitha.        
	Baitha, who is Kanke for a 11-day puja that would conclude on June 24, however, put a brave front. He said he was not against the party but was against some of the leaders within his party.         
	I will give an appropriate answer to the show cause expected to be served on me. Though I am one of the oldest serving MLAs, no one from the party had approached me before the RS polls, he explained.

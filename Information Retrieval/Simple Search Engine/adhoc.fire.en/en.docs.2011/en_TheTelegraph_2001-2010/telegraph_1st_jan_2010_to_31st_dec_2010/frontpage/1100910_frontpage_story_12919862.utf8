The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sonia sets line on industry 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Sonia sets line on industry 
  - Development model with   balanced approach        SANJAY K. JHA                            Sonia Gandhi at the meeting in Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today emphatically asked the government to strike a balance between industrial development and environment protection and suggested a comprehensive rehabilitation scheme for landlosers.        
	Sonias assertion is the most categorical yet on the subject and crystallises the stand voiced by Rahul Gandhi during an Orissa rally where he declared himself a sipahi of tribal interests.        
	Earlier this week, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had spoken of a balanced approach and that industry must recognise environment concerns but added that we cannot solve environmental problems by perpetuating poverty. We need a balance between environmental concerns and poverty eradication.        
	The Congress presidents clarification comes also at a time various ministries are locked in a stand-off with the environment ministry, headed by Jairam Ramesh, for raising objections to projects such as an airport on the outskirts of Mumbai and industrial ventures elsewhere.        
	Dedicating the NTPCs National Capital Thermal Power Project, Dadri, Stage-II, to the nation here today, the Congress chief warned policy-makers against laying abnormal stress on industrial growth at the cost of agriculture.        
	Her approach suggests that the Congress wants to amplify its projection of itself as the champion of the deprived and the dispossessed, although the government is keen on a much greater push for industry to reduce the countrys reliance on agriculture which has its own limitations.         
	Many in the Congress viewed Sonias speech as a significant departure, much like her emphasis before 2004 on the welfare state, following which Manmohan Singh spoke of economic reforms with a human face.        
	The debate within the Congress on the contours of Manmohanomics that acquired a particular dimension in the P.V. Narasimha Rao regime finally gave birth to a nuanced economic philosophy which put a brake on blanket divestment and created space for huge social sector expenditure.         
	Senior Congress leaders feel Sonias clarification will inject a sense of purpose in the government which is sitting on the Land Acquisition Amendment Bill for so long. The frequent conflicts of various ministers with Ramesh on development projects and airports should also come to an end after Sonias signal.        
	Sonia made it clear that she was not against industry but stressed that all concerns should be accommodated while fine-tuning a development model.        
	On industry, Sonia said: We definitely need to generate more power from different sources to meet the growing demands from our farmers, our factories and our people. Economic growth is built on greater electricity production and consumption. At the same time, we must protect the environment to ensure sustainable development. In whatever we do, we must not forget that our lush forests and mountains, majestic rivers and all other water sources, and clean air have sustained and nurtured us for millennia. We have a responsibility to preserve them for the coming generations.        
	Sonias signposts, along with the strong endorsement on August 26 by Rahul of the brake on the Vedanta mining project in Orissa, indicate that the government will not clear in a hurry any project that stirs environment concerns.        
	Sonia also touched upon one of the most contentious issues vexing policymakers  land acquisition.         
	I would also like to say a few words on land acquisition. New industry and new infrastructure cannot be built without acquiring land. This is obvious. But land acquisition must be done in a manner that does not result in the loss of large tracts of fertile and productive agricultural land so indispensable to cultivate foodgrain needed to feed our people. And if farmers are deprived of their land-based livelihood, they must be provided with adequate compensation and alternative occupation. Some states like Haryana have progressive legislation in this regard. Other states would do well to emulate it.         
	Sonia has not slammed the door shut on land acquisition but, given the reality of lack of non-fertile land in some states, such as in Bengal, she seems to be pinning hope on job-oriented rehabilitation schemes to persuade people to give up land.        
	The government plans to table the land acquisition amendment bill in the next session of Parliament which will coincide with the run-up to elections in Bengal. Some of the earlier provisions in the bill had been opposed by Mamata Banerjee.         
	Sonia used Manmohans trophy theme  nuclear energy  to drive home her point. Our future requirements necessitate that we pay much more attention to clean and renewable sources of energy. Now that Parliament has passed the Civil Nuclear Liability Bill, India is in a position to invest in nuclear power to help meet its growing needs. I understand that NTPC is gearing up to enter the field of nuclear energy. It is also taking steps to expand the utilisation of wind and solar energy on a larger scale. This is a tribute to its culture of innovation and performance.                     WITH INPUTS FROM R.

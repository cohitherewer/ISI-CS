	Guwahati, Jan. 30: A zoo tigress that had killed a visitor two years ago slipped out of her enclosure with her cub this morning, sparking pandemonium for nearly two hours.        
	Some 2,000 visitors were at Guwahati zoo around 10.30am when Divya, 8, spotted that cleaners had left the door of her hillock-top enclosure ajar. She and the 20-month-old male cub would have been hungry  the zoo doesnt feed carnivores on Fridays.        
	By the time Divya had been tranquillised about 12.15pm, she had covered 300 metres, sauntering past the giraffe enclosure and making for the hippopotamus zone while staff herded visitors to safety.

	College student Ambar Saikia had spotted the tigress coming down the slopes. I thought it was a big dog; I shouted to my friend to see what a big dog it was. Then the authorities alerted us to vacate the zoo immediately.        
	Narayan Mahanta, divisional forest officer at the zoo, blamed lack of co-ordination between animal keeper Rangeel Ali and veterinary employees B. Appa Rao and Prabin Mikir for the incident.        
	Rao and Mikir had let the tigers out from their cubicle into the main enclosure so they could clean the cubicle, but had forgotten to lock the enclosure door.        
	I was spraying disinfectants inside the cubicle when I saw the two tigers stroll out of the enclosure, Rao said, adding he had immediately shouted to Mikir to run. Ali had left by then. I screamed at a group of approaching children, telling them the tigers were out in the open, Mikir said.        
	The cub was tranquillised half an hour later, about 100 metres from the enclosure. But it took more than an hour and 45 minutes to tame Divya, Mahanta said.        
	Forest and veterinary staff fired the first dart when she stopped near a palm grove but missed. The second hit her in the back and the third caused her to collapse.        
	The two tigers are recovering from the shock at an off-exhibition-area enclosure, Mahanta said, adding that neither had shown any sign of aggression while in the open. An inquiry will be conducted.        
	Divya and her mate Gobardhan had in December 2007 mauled a visitor to death after he tried to click pictures by putting his hands inside their enclosure.

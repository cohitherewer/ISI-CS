          MUZAFFAR RAINA                            Protesters throw stones at policemen during a curfew in Srinagar on Monday. (AP)                                  
	Srinagar, Aug. 30: Death is a mere statistic in Kashmir but this one is likely to trouble Omar Abdullah for a while: more people have died in the present unrest than during the 2008 Amarnath land row, making it the deadliest agitation since 1990.        
	The protest that began on June 11 has devoured 64 lives, mostly in firing by security forces on stone-throwing mobs, and is still not showing signs of abating. In contrast, the Amarnath agitation had left 52 civilians dead.         
	The fresh azaadi groundswell began when a teenager, Tufail Ahmad Mattoo, died in unprovoked firing in Srinagars old city, fuelling protests that led to more killings and uprisings, every death eroding Omars credibility.        
	There are no two opinions about it and the chief minister has himself confessed it. But you have to understand that there is a terrible assertion on the ground and the issues involved are larger than Omar Abdullahs or any CMs capacity, said Gul Mohammad Wani, who teaches political science at Kashmir University.        
	This is an indigenous, native assertion where there is no provocation from outside (Pakistan). It is a manifestation of Kashmiri nationalism which is caught in an oppressed state, and though it began gradually and incrementally it has turned into a behemoth.        
	Kashmir has a long history of street protests but the protests in 1990, for their magnitude and huge death toll, serve as a yardstick for the intensity of later crises.        
	In 1990, the protesters were largely peaceful  unlike the present breed who fight with stones  but could be harnessed only after hundreds died in alleged firing by security forces at Gow Kadal, Hawal, Handwara, Zakoora and many other places. The deaths spurred thousands to pick up arms that summer, pitchforking militancy to the centre stage and relegating street protests to the margins.        
	The insurgency claimed thousands of lives in the next two decades. But not many died in the street protests.         
	That changed in 2008 when the Congress-PDP coalition allotted 100 acres of forest land to the Amarnath shrine board, bringing lakhs to the streets in protest. Kashmiri Muslims saw it as a step toward changing the states demography.        
	The government cancelled the allotment, triggering a pro-Amarnath land agitation in Jammu and an economic blockade of the Valley.         
	When the blockade ended, the uprising metamorphosed into an azaadi groundswell. The Valley virtually slipped into the hands of the separatists who held serial rallies at Pampore, Tourist Reception Centre and Eidgah. But the protests petered out after a break during Ramazan.        
	But this time the protests have continued during Ramazan. Historian Fida Hassnain said the present uprising was unique. It is being exclusively spearheaded by young boys, many in their teens and there is very thin participation of elders, he said. It is the youngsters who are not allowing the agitation to fail.

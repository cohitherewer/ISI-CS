  - Party the best, says Gogoi as Opposition cries foul          A STAFF REPORTER                                                    
	Guwahati, March 26: The ruling Congress today won both the Rajya Sabha seats from Assam but it had to persevere to make up the numbers as the combined Opposition tried to retain its flock.        
	The Congress first preference candidate Nazneen Faruque polled 43 votes, second preference Silvius Condpan polled 42 while the Oppositions Jayanta Baruah got 40 in the 126-member House.         
	But it was not an easy ride, as was evident from the anxious wait for results and the celebrations thereof at the CLP office and Rajiv Bhawan, the party headquarters.        
	The Congress camp wore a worried look after one of its senior members, social welfare minister and Dispur MLA Akon Bora, signed the ballot papers which eventually led to the cancellation of his vote.        
	Such was the shock of the partys poll co-ordinators that they took away the pens of their MLAs and some friendly MLAs to avoid a repeat.        
	This after the CLP had held two dummy runs on how to vote in the past two days.         
	The MLAs were even tutored on the voting process before entering the Central Hall venue, leaving most anxious, some doubting their intellect and still others seething.         
	Bora understandably was missing even after the victory.        
	However, the Congress more than made up for the loss by ensuring that friendly Opposition MLAs  BJPs Abhijit Hazarika, Rumi Nath, Kartik Sena Sinha, Sambhu Singh Malla, AIUDFs Rasul Haque and Anawarul Haque, AGPs Abdul Aziz and ASDCs Jagat Singh Engti  not only turned up but also voted in its favour.         
	In all, the Congress had the committed support of 75 MLAs and received support from 11 Opposition MLAs  four BJP, two AIUDF, one AGP, one ASDC and three Independents.        
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi, PCC president Bhubaneswar Kalita and sitting MP in the Lok Sabha, Paban Singh Ghatowar, were all there to keep an eye on the proceedings.         
	Television footage showed ministers Rockybul Hussain and Himanta Biswa Sarma escorting Nath, Hazarika and Sinha to the Assembly in the latters car. Subsequently, the BJPs authorised agent Prasanta Phukan lodged a complaint with the returning officer that the partys MLAs were induced into voting for the Congress and, therefore, their votes should not be counted.        
	The Opposition deserters claimed they supported the Congress for the overall development of their respective constituencies.         
	There was no horse-trading, they asserted, before leaving the Assembly. Aziz said he was threatened by an Opposition leader.         
	The BJP, AIUDF and AGP legislators have since been suspended and their effigies burnt in some constituencies, the Opposition said.         
	The Opposition maintained till the end that the fight was not over and there would be crossvoting from among the associate members of the Congress. But it was not to be.        
	The day started with AGPs Keshav Mahanta casting the first vote and ended with AIUDFs Salimuddin Barbhuyan casting the last one in favour of Baruah, who left around 3pm, probably sensing defeat.         
	As the results were declared, the CLP room was packed with well-wishers, hangers-on and party leaders congratulating Gogoi, Kalita and the two candidates.         
	Gogoi claimed it to be a great victory, which proved there was no alternative to the Congress.         
	For Faruque, it was the victory of truth while Condpan attributed his win to Sonia Gandhis blessings.         
	The Opposition claimed a moral victory for the manner in which the ruling party had garnered the required votes. Opposition leader Chandra Mohan Patowary said whatever the result, Gogoi had morally lost the battle.         
	AIUDFs working president H.R.A. Choudhury said the Congresss victory was a slur on the people of Assam while BJPs Mission Ranjan Das described it as a murder of democracy.         
	BJPs Rameswar Teli said the deserters were politically finished.         
	The Opposition maintained that money had changed hands to secure votes.        
	BJP chief spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters here, It is unfortunate that in the state, which elected the Prime Minister, democracy stands murdered by Congress leaders, including the chief minister and his ministers.         
	He said the four BJP MLAs who voted for Congress have been suspended.         
	If they are expelled, then their membership in the Assembly will remain intact. We are going to file a formal application with the Speaker tomorrow for disqualification of these MLAs for defying the party whip and request the Speaker to give his decision at the earliest, he said.        
	Prasad said under the Tenth Schedule the MLAs were liable to be disqualified as legislators. He said the BJP would move the Election Commission to ensure purity of election.         
	The Tarun Gogoi government announced the constitution of development councils for some communities a day ahead of the polls. It was the worst form of inducement, Prasad alleged.         
	The AIUDF also suspended its two deserter MLAs and is planning their expulsion.

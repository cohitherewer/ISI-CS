                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                40,000 people evacuated, cyclone shows signs of weakening 
                            
	Hyderabad, May 20 (PTI): Over 40,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas of Andhra Pradesh even as cyclone Laila appeared to be weakening gradually today and is expected to cross the states coast near Machilipatnam.         
	Laila remained practically stationary and lay centred some 200 km south off Machilipatnam coast and is likely to hit the mainland this afternoon, according to the latest bulletin released by the Met department.         
	The system is showing signs of weakening due to increase of wind shear and land interaction, the Met bulletin said.         
	However, the threat has not subsided fully yet as gales with speeds of over 115 km in the coastal areas may cause a lot of damage, a senior official of the Disaster Management Department here said.        
	We have already moved about 40,000 people from vulnerable villages to safety and many more will be shifted based on need, he said.         
	Defence Minister A K Antony said, The armed forces were always ready to help the civil administration whenever they are in distress.        
	Whatever help is needed from the Navy and the other armed forces, we will extend, he said.         
	Nellore, Prakasam, Guntur, Krishna, West Godavari and East Godavari districts are likely to bear the brunt of the cyclonic storm even as heavy to extremely heavy rain has been forecast in the coastal districts in the next 36 hours.         
	Chief Minister K Rosaiah monitored the situation through the night and held a tele-conference with district collectors to review the rescue operations and preparedness of the government machinery. The Chief Minister directed that adequate stocks of essential commodities be kept ready in these places.         
	He also asked the collectors to make food and medical arrangements for people in relief camps.

	New Delhi, May 10: The Congress is fairly smarting under the excesses of its smart set.         
	The Prime Minister and the party today admonished environment minister Jairam Ramesh for calling the home ministrys attitude towards the Chinese alarmist and paranoid, the latest in a slew of resorts to the rod the high command has been forced to by frontbenchers.         
	Shashi Tharoor, who eventually had to quit over the IPL tangle, had often teased disciplinary limits with his tweeter-thumb. Following his cattle class-holy cow taunt at the UPAs austerity drive, he had been officially advised to rein in his urge to go public with comments, but to little effect.         
	Mani Shankar Aiyar, recently nominated to the Rajya Sabha, took up arms against what he called home minister P. Chidambarams one-eyed policy against Maoists, and never recanted.         
	Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh, too, had lashed out at Chidambarams approach to Naxalites in a newspaper article, calling him, among other things, intellectually arrogant. Singh met Chidambaram last week, but it is not known whether he sought to make amends for views he had put on public record.        
	The repeated breach of the collective responsibility ethic has elicited strong disapproval from the Prime Ministers Office: ministers should mind their jobs, airing criticism of colleagues will not be tolerated. Sources said the Prime Minister told Ramesh this in as many words today; but the warning was also meant to be a general laying down the line on ministerial and party discipline.        
	Almost at the same time, the Congress articulated its ire over remarks such as the ones Ramesh made on his China trip.        
	There can be, and are, differences of opinion in a democratic set-up but there are enough and proper forums to air them, party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said. We strongly disapprove of party and government leaders airing their views on colleagues publicly, especially on foreign soil.        
	Rameshs comments left the home ministry seething  Chidambaram is reported to have complained to the Prime Minister in writing.         
	 It is wrong to say that the security establishment was biased against Chinese companies. So far as national security was concerned, our interests, our policy is to ensure that national security is protected and in every case, irrespective of the foreign country involved, home secretary G.K. Pillai said.        
	But Congress leaders believe they have a problem on hand that goes beyond individuals and egos, or being an image problem.        
	It is becoming a troublesome phenomenon, one leader said. Everybody thinks he has the right to say everything and anything; no organisation, least of all a government and a ruling party, can function with this kind of anarchic freedoms, the line must be drawn.         
	One reason the Congress spokesman was blunt about non-tolerance of breaches such as the one made by Ramesh is that the Opposition pounced on it.         
	Before Singhvi declared Rameshs comments out of line, BJP spokesperson Prakash Jawadekar had demanded that the minister be sacked for breach of discipline.        
	A BJP release issued later broadened the attack on Ramesh, virtually accusing him of lobbying for Chinese firms, saying the utterances of Shri Jairam Ramesh establish lobbyists also operate from within the government.         
	Alleging that Ramesh had rubbished the home ministrys security guidelines, the statement said: Can a Union minister urge the government to trade with particular companies?... The Indian minister lobbying for Chinese companies notwithstanding, there is a security threat to India (Ramesh) loses the moral authority to remain in the cabinet, the Prime Minister owes us an explanation for the conduct of his colleague.

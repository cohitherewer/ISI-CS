The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tamars Robin Hood the surprise
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tamars Robin Hood the surprise
          AMIT GUPTA                             Shooting star: Raja Peter                                  
	 Ranchi, Oct. 8: Raja Peter, Tamars Robin Hood who went on to defeat the mighty Shibu Soren in 2009 to become an MLA, got his reward today when he found place in Arjun Mundas cabinet, edging out JD(U) heavyweight with political connections Sudha Choudhary.        
	The other surprises that Munda threw up were the elevation of two first time ministers  BJPs Simdega MLA Vimala Pradhan as the lone woman in the cabinet and the partys Nala MLA Satyanand Jha Batul, the only representative of the upper castes in the government.         
	I will not say much, but my work will do. Whatever portfolio is given to me, I will perform my best, said Peter, two-time MLA from Tamar (reserved) seat, who is considered to be close to the chief minister since both claim the same Patar Munda lineage.        
	Peter was first elected from Tamar as a Jharkhand Party MLA but the shrewd politician, who is quite a crowdpuller because of his well cultivated Robin Hood image, later switched sides to the JD(U) after mentor Anosh Ekka went to jail on corruption charges.        
	 Today, Peter managed to turn the tables on party MLA Sudha Choudhary who represents Chatarpur in Palamau and happens to be the sister of Bihar Speaker Uday Narayan Chaudhary.         
	In the Soren cabinet Sudha Choudhary was a minister holding social welfare, women and child development and tourism portfolios. But, during the governments short stint she couldnt make a mark, neither in government nor in the Assembly.        
	Showing off a spotless white attire  white shoes included  and cheered on by a band of followers calling themselves Raja Peter Fans Club, Jamshedpur, Peter was later overheard saying, Ab dekho aage-aage hota hai kya. Ab main apni kabiliyat dikhaunga. (See what happens next. Now, I will prove my worth).         
	 Peters elevation to the Cabinet from the JD(U)s quota proved to be a boon for first time BJP MLA Vimala Pradhan. This is like giving respect to a woman, she said when asked about being the lone woman in the Munda cabinet. I will work for the development and welfare of women. Ill shoulder whatever responsibility is given to me, she said.        
	BJPs Satyanand Jha Batul seemed more than elated while taking oath. Dressed in a yellow kurta and orange coat, he was one of the few politicians who shook hands with other politicians, bureaucrats and senior police officials.         
	I will try and ensure governance in the state is improved. I had no competition with anyone to become a minister, he said on whether he had ruined the chances of Rajmahal BJP MLA Arun Mandal.                           
	Seraikela JMM MLA Champai Soren is also another new face in the Munda cabinet. The veteran politician and close confidant of the JMM supremo, chose to be philosophical about his late elevation as minister.         
	Politics is a game of chance. My chance came a bit late. I am now satisfied and will perform my duties as minister judiciously, he said.

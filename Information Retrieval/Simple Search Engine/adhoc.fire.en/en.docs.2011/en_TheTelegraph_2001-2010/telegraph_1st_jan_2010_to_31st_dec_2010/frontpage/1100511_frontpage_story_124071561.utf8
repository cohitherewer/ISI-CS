	Kolkata, May 11 (PTI): In a joint venture, Kolkata police and Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) today initiated an anti-human trafficking campaign with the release of posters and a film by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC). 
    
	Speaking on the occasion, Kolkata's police Commissioner Goutam Mohan chakraborty said ldquo;Human trafficking has wide range implications because apart from sex-based trafficking which is most common, there are other kinds of trafficking which also need to be addressed rdquo;. Chakraborty emphasises ldquo;we need to think seriously about the rehabilitation of the victims because we have to provide them with the opportunity of returning to the mainstream rdquo;. He adds ldquo;This is not the responsibility of the police alone. Rather the entire society should come forward and make scope so that the affected persons can be rehabilitated rdquo;. 
    
	Chairperson of State Women's Commission Malini Bhattacharya said ldquo;Most of the people don't have an idea of the trauma that people suffer after being trafficked. They have a very superficial idea about trafficking and their rehabilitation rdquo;. Bhattacharya said ldquo;Trafficking is an international crime and it is not a problem which can be solved in a day and everybody should come forward to solve this menace rdquo;. 
    
	A film developed by UNODC 'One Life No Price' and some posters were released to create awareness among the people. Eminent film personality Debasree Roy and CII chairperson Ram Agarwal were present on the occasion.

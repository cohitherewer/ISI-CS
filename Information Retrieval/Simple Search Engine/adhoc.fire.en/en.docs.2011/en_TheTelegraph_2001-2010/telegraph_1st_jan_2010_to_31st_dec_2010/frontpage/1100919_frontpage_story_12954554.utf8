The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cardiac care boost for Assam
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cardiac care boost for Assam
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, Sept. 18: The Asian Heart Institute (AHI), one of the best cardiac care units in the world, today announced its decision to collaborate with the health institutes in Assam.         
	Cardiovascular-thoracic surgeon and vice-chairman at AHI, Mumbai, Dr Ramakant Panda, told reporters that his institute had already chalked out plans to either set up a counselling centre in the city or collaborate with institutes like Gauhati Medical College and Hospital to treat patients suffering from cardiac ailments.         
	We are aware that a good chunk of populace in the state go outside for cardiac treatment which implies incurring huge expenditure. If we can set up a post-surgery rehabilitation centre for patients undergoing bypass surgery at any hospital in Assam, it would be great help. The AHI will discuss the issue in detail with the Assam government, Panda said.         
	The surgeon was in the city to conduct a check-up on chief minister Tarun Gogoi who underwent a bypass surgery at AHI last month.         
	He said the post-surgery recovery of the chief minister had been remarkable and he would be fit to resume full-fledged public life after 15 days.         
	Gogois mental strength is very strong and he is found to be a very obedient patient. In case of bypass surgery, strong mental health helps the cardiologists to win half the battle in treatment. Such patients recover very fast and Gogoi falls in this category, Panda said.         
	Asked whether Gogoi would be able to lead an active public life, especially when the state is headed for Assembly elections next year, Panda said he did not find any reason for apprehension.         
	He said there was a vast difference between cardiac treatment in the past and present days.         
	Now it needs three months of rest, medication and care after a patient undergoes such treatment. But in case of Gogoi, recovery is unexpectedly good and we will be able to reduce the quantum of medicines after completion of two months. Gogois heart has become stronger than before and he will be fully fit to resume all responsibilities within a few days, Panda said.         
	Speaking about the causes of cardiac ailments in the country, Panda said smoking, changed lifestyles and less physical exercise were the prime causes of such illnesses. He said yoga was one of the best forms of exercise to prevent cardiac ailments.         
	Panda, who has been awarded the Padma Bhushan, is fascinated by Assams tourism potential and plans to visit Kaziranga National Park soon.

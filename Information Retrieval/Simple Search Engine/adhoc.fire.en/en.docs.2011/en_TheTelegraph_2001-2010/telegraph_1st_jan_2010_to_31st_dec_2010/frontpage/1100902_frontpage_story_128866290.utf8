	Karachi, Sep 2 (PTI): Even as Pakistan Manager Yawar Saeed announced end of England tour for the tainted trio of Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Aamir, Sports Minister Aijaz Jakhrani today said the players may play the one-day series.
    Jakhrani was also not keen to use the word 'dropped' and said the trio was just 'unavailable' to play in the Twenty20 series against England.
    Jakhrani said the three players, who allegedly took money from a bookie to bowl no balls during the Lord's Test against England last week, will be in London to "cooperate" with the Scotland Yard's investigation into the 'spot-fixing' scandal.
    "They are not playing because they have probably gone to answer the investigating team. They are not at the venue where the matches are being held, so they would not be playing.

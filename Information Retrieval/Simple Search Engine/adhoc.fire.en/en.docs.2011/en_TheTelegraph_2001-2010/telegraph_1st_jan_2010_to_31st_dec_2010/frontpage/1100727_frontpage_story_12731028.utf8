The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Night shift takes out 6 Maoists
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Night shift takes out 6 Maoists
  - Top gun among dead;   forces lose commando         NARESH JANA                      Sidhu Soren                                      
	Metala, July 26: The joint forces today gunned down six Maoists, including a top leader and a woman, in an operation reflecting a nascent strategy shift: the troops could increasingly be carrying out risky night operations for bigger success against the rebels.        
	The pre-dawn swoop that busted a rebel camp in the jungles of Metala, about 25km from Lalgarh, killed Sidhu Soren, secretary of the central committee of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, and woman cadre Bela Karmakar.        
	Officers credited the success, the second-biggest against the Maoists in Bengal, to precise information about the camps location and hours of stealthy advance through dense forests in the night to surprise the enemy.        
	Their bravery will earn the 240-odd troops a paltry reward of Rs 200 per head: state police chief Bhupinder Singh said a sum of Rs 50,000 would be divided among them.        
	Security forces usually avoid night raids on Maoists because of the greater danger of ambush and mines, thus sacrificing speed of response and the element of surprise. But the Metala raid suggests they may be veering towards a no risk, no gain motto, emboldened by their first big night swoop that killed eight rebels near Lalgarh on June 16, inflicting on the Maoists their biggest loss in Bengal.        
	The troops counted a loss today: a 23-year-old commando from the CRPFs crack Cobra unit, Ashis Kumar Tiwari of Jharkhand, died after taking a bullet under his right ear.        
	All six dead Maoists were under 25 and three have been identified as Arjun, Rakhal and Sanatan, the police said. A Maoist source claimed Sidhu alias Bhuta Baskey  who also headed the Peoples Committees armed wing, Gana Militia  had committed suicide after fighting like a hero but did not explain whether he might have done so to avoid imminent capture.        
	Maoist sources said Sidhus writ ran over huge swathes of the rebel belt in Bengal and his death would offer the police a chance to again dominate these areas.        
	Local sources had told the police some 16 Maoists had been roaming around Metala for a fortnight. Yesterday, two mobile conversations were intercepted, helping pinpoint their location. We did not waste any time; we moved in at night to surprise them, said West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma.        
	Two teams of 20 Cobra commandos each left for Metala around 4pm for a recce. Soon after midnight, deputy superintendent Chandrasekhar Bardhan set out with a team of 200 CRPF and state armed police troops from their Goaltore camp.        
	The team split into two and travelled 10km in trucks to two points on the edge of the forest, then trekked the remaining 5km.        
	The advance Cobra party had already spotted a yellow tarpaulin tent inside the forest. Around 4am, shots were fired from the tent and a gunfight began.        
	At 5am, Tiwari was hit. We followed the direction of the shot and discovered two black tents, an officer said.        
	Around 5.30, the rebel firing eased off. They started running. We chased them for nearly 3km, and shots were exchanged, the officer said. Around 9am, the rebels vanished deep inside the jungle.        
	The police have seized over a dozen single-barrel rifles, pistols and revolvers, nearly 450 rounds of ammunition, explosives, detonators and flash guns. One of the tents allegedly yielded a hand-drawn map showing the routes to the police station and CPM office in Sarenga, Bankura, about 7km from the encounter site.         
	The police have detained two people after running into them within 1km of the scene.

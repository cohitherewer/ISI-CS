	New York, Sept. 10: The Bryan brothers opened their purse-strings and took the Grand Slam trophy from the Brotherhood Team.        
	Dont smell another fixed match here. Just a sampling of the goodwill on display at Flushing Meadows on Friday.         
	Indias Rohan Bopanna and Pakistans Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi lost to the American twins in the mens mixed doubles final at the US Open but the match lived up to the symbolism built around it.        
	 Bob and Mike Bryan captured their third title at Flushing Meadows and 65th overall with a 7-6 (5), 7-6 (4) victory Friday in a match in which neither team broke serve. Bopanna and Qureshi, 16th seeds, did not look like a team playing their first Grand Slam final as they made the world number one pair work hard for points for more than one-and-a-half hours.        
	As on Wednesday when the best measure of the Indo-Pak Expresss accomplishment was found in the stands, UN ambassadors from India and Pakistan, Hardeep Puri and Abdullah H. Haroon, kept their word and attended the final. Bopannas parents also made it.        
	Clichs are difficult to banish from such symbolic events but Qureshi and Bopanna did win hearts though they lost the match  at least Bob vouched for that on record.        
	The affable Qureshi showed the secret of his popularity when he took back the microphone to thank Bob afresh for donating money less than 24 hours ago for Pakistan flood relief.        
	Liezel Huber and Bob had beaten Kveta Peschke of the Czech Republic and Qureshi in the mixed doubles final on Thursday. The American said during Thursdays trophy ceremony that his charitable foundation, which he runs with his twin, was donating money to the flood relief.        
	Those guys are great guys, Bryan said of Qureshi and Bopanna. Everyone in the locker room likes them. Just hearing about the problem, talked about it with my brother and my dad, and just wanted to do it.                  Ambassadors Puri and Haroon watch the match. Jay Mandal/On Assignment      
	Every little bit helps, Qureshi said. Ive been trying to send some good news back home from here for two weeks.... Its a really, really kind gesture. I owe them.        
	Told he could pay the Bryans back by giving them the mens doubles title, Qureshi had joked on Thursday: I gave him the mixed doubles title today.         
	The mens doubles title, too, as it turned out later on Friday.        
	Qureshi did not forget to highlight something  without a hint of rancour  that will strike a chord among countless sportspersons and spectators in the subcontinent.         
	Ive spent the last 14 years trying to put tennis in the spotlight in my country, the 30-year-old Qureshi said. Crickets like a religion there. This moment is like a highlight in my career. When I was growing up, I thought maybe someday I could win a Grand Slam or make it to one Grand Slam final. But two Grand Slam finals in a week? Its unbelievable.        
	On Friday, Qureshi reminded the spectators  to loud cheers  that his country was celebrating Id and they should not view Pakistan only through the prism of terror.        
	These things are not meant to achieve anything directly but these will embellish the peace process, Haroon said. Some say this is a romantic vision but it is better to have this vision than to fall prey to the status quo.

	Ranchi, Dec. 28: Ally gaffes and adversary guffaws have not just left the Arjun Munda government red in the face, but are also threatening to hijack the abridged winter session of the Assembly, which began today.        
	Barely four months after the BJP realigned with the very unpredictable JMM supremo Shibu Soren, his ministers are but a fascinating spectacle of human folly.        
	Revenue and land reforms minister Mathura Mahto is numero uno on this blunder bandwagon. On December 4, his department issued a notification to all deputy commissioners (DCs), asking them to ensure that Section 46(1)(b) of the Chotanagpur Tenancy (CNT) Act was implemented with immediate effect and land belonging to SC/ST/backward castes was not transferred without their (DCs) permission.        
	Citing technical reasons, the Munda government hurriedly withdrew the notification on December 10 to douse the fire that Mahto had already triggered across the state.         
	The suitably annoyed JMM minister went public with his ammo against the BJP-led government. At a function in Jamshedpur on December 26, he said the notification was put on hold under pressure from the builders lobby.         
	Deputy chief minister and JMMs Dumka MLA Hemant Soren added that the CNT Act was not a roadblock for development. And Soren senior topped it up with the declaration that there would be no amendment to the act.         
	In a fine predicament, the chief minister thought it wise to keep his calm. He said he was taking opinion of legal experts on the matter.         
	However, a closed-door meeting with Mahto ahead of the Assembly session gave Opposition leader and JVM boss Babulal Marandi enough fodder to put up a fight. He claimed that the JMM ministers allegation had only vindicated his stand that the Munda government had been propped up by capitalists.         
	Now, bad luck comes in bulk.         
	The BJP-led government had barely licked its wound clean when health minister and senior JMM leader Hemlal Murmu, on December 23, issued a notification to appoint Tulsi Mahto as the new director of state-run Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) without the chief ministers approval.         
	While the director has already taken charge, the health secretary is unable to explain how the notification was issued without the mandatory nod from the chief minister.                          
	Deputy chief minister Hemant Soren, however, takes the faux pas cake.         
	On December 24, Soren junior created a flutter in the capital when he said the government would impose levy on drinking water from public taps to tide over an acute water crisis.         
	Realisation dawned on him quicker than party colleague Mahto. In a face-saver, he said he was quoted out of context by the media and was not in favour of imposing the levy. But the damage had been done and the Opposition had picked the cue.        
	Both BJP and JMM leaders concede that the trios off-the-cuff remarks have put the coalition in jeopardy. Ministers should not air their grievances in public, rather they should find a proper platform (cabinet meeting), one pointed out.         
	JMM steering committee member Vinod Pandey said a meeting had been convened on December 2 to draw a common strategy so that alliance partners did not speak in contradictory voices.        
	BJP state president Dineshanand Goswami too admitted a rift in the alliance, but said the government should review the CNT Act and, for that matter any law, for all-round development of the state. It is not a political issue and the Opposition should extend support, he added.        
	But Mathura Mahto has decided to stick to his guns. The issue cannot be discussed at the cabinet meeting. Do you discuss implementation of Section 302 if theres a murder? he argued.        
	Sources in both parties said the conflict was more than meets the eye. The ministers are upset with the chief minister for holding up transfers. December is the month of rejig, which brings pecuniary benefits to the powers that be, a source revealed.

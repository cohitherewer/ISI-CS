  - On eve of Test, dismay in Indian camp over wicket           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                    
	Feb. 13: Theres dismay, if not anger, in the India camp over the somewhat greenish look of the Eden wicket.        
	Strangely, its only in India that we tend to get apologetic about offering even a semblance of home advantage. Not always, but often at the wrong time.        
	Case in point being the Eden wicket, which will determine whether Mahendra Singh Dhonis India stays No. 1 in the Test rankings or South Africa reclaims that position, lost a shade over two months ago.        
	Of course, a two-match series isnt the best way to identify which team is worthy of being at the summit, but one must remember that this face-off has been arranged outside the regular calendar.         
	Allow the cattle to graze and the grass will disappear, said an Indian cricketer, rather caustically, when someone asked what should be done about the look.        
	That was this afternoon, less than 20 hours before the 9.15am start of the second and final Test for the Jaypee Infratech Cup.        
	Some of the grass was clipped/shaved a couple of hours later, but concerns remained.         
	A parallel hasnt exactly been drawn with what the Vidarbha Cricket Association, then headed by the current Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Shashank Manohar, did in October 2004, but its still being whispered.         
	The wicket at the old stadium in Nagpur had so delighted the Australians that the stand-in captain, Adam Gilchrist, went to the extent of saying he was reminded of the Waca Ground in Perth!        
	Clearly, a perfect advertisement for home disadvantage.         
	For the record, India (captained by Rahul Dravid in Sourav Gangulys absence) lost that Test by a massive 342 runs.         
	While nobody has gone on record, The Telegraph learns that it had been left to a member of the team management to liaise with the BCCI on the type of wickets to be prepared for this series.        
	Who said exactly what, and when, isnt known. However, its possible that there was a delay in fully communicating what needed to be conveyed and with the Eden being a World Cup venue, the prepare-a-spinning-wicket diktat was disregarded.        
	In any case, as reported in this newspaper, that came not before the series got underway, in Jamtha, on February 6, but during the first Test itself.         
	That ought not to come as a shock, as the BCCI isnt exactly the epitome of professionalism.        
	After what happened at the Kotla, last December, curator Prabir Mukherjee didnt think twice about ignoring the diktat which, in any case, was verbal.        
	Actually, for a change, Mukherjee has been more in the news than the Cricket Association of Bengal president Jagmohan Dalmiya. Its quite a feat.         
	Significantly, Dhoni has called for challenging wickets rather than the cliched sporting ones. As for whats in store, he said: Theres a bit of grass. I think the seamers will get a bit of help.        
	A decision wont be made till just shortly before the toss, but the Indians have kept open the option of a 3-1 attack, with Harbhajan Singh (who hasnt been at his best of late) being the sole specialist spinner.        
	If thats the composition, then Zaheer Khan will have Sreesanth and Ishant Sharma for company.         
	Whats confirmed is that V.V.S. Laxman will be returning to the XI, in place of Wriddhiman Saha.        
	After being routed with a day to spare, in the first Test, whatever the look of the Eden wicket, its time to show character. And, to prove the Ian Chappells wrong.

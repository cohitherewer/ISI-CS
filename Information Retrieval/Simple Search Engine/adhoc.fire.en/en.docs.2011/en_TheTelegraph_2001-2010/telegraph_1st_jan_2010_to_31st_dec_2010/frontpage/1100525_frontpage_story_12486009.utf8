                          Police patrol the streets the day after a state of emergency was called in Kingston, Jamaica                                 
	Kingston, May 25 (AFP): Running battles between Jamaican authorities and drug gang members turned part of Kingston into a warzone. The death toll rose to at least three as gunmen fired on security forces hunting an alleged drug kingpin.        
	One soldier was killed when troops supporting police plunged into the Tivoli Gardens neighbourhood, breaking through barricades erected by supporters of Christopher Dudus Coke, whom authorities want to extradite to the United States.        
	Explosions shook the impoverished neighbourhood sending out thick plumes of smoke. The incident happened a day after Prime Minister Bruce Goldings government declared a state of emergency.        
	On Sunday night, two policemen were killed, and two members of the security forces sustained injuries. Another seven were injured yesterday.        
	National Security Minister Dwight Nelson said on national television that he had received unconfirmed reports of several civilian deaths and the airwaves were full of desperate pleas from residents pinned inside building by gunfire. Somebody please come and help us one woman begged on local radio.        
	The ruling Jamaica Labour Party tried to reassure citizens, saying the raids was inescapable and unavoidable. We hope that out of the national crisis there will come a rebirth of Jamaica, the land we love.

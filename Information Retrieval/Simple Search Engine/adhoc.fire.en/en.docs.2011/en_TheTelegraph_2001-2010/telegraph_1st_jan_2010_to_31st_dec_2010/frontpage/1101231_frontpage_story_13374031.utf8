          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: The Justice Srikrishna Committee today handed its report on the Telangana statehood demand to the government, which did not reveal the contents and bought a weeks time to consult political parties.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram, who received the report, said it would first be shown to the eight recognised political parties of Andhra Pradesh at a meeting on January 6. Only then would its contents be made public and an appropriate decision taken on its recommendations.        
	That is the only way in a democracy, and those who respect democracy must also respect the processes of democracy, he said. Immediately after the meeting, the report will be made public.        
	The statehood controversy has the potential to spark trouble but government sources said the two-volume report was believed to be non-committal and safe.         
	The five-member committee had said two days ago that they would suggest several options with their pros and cons in an attempt to achieve the highest satisfaction of the largest number.        
	Today, the committees member secretary, Vinod K. Duggal, said: We have given the way forward. We have said what is to be done. There are many options.        
	The invites to the eight political parties were sent today, sources said. These parties last meeting on Telangana was held on January 5 this year, after which the committee headed by Justice (retired) B.N. Srikrishna was formed.         
	Its deadline for submitting the report was December 31.        
	Chidambaram said the report would be a path forward, a path that will bring satisfaction, happiness and prosperity to the people.         
	The committee was able to consult all sections of the people and all political parties and groups in Andhra Pradesh. The report will be carefully studied in the ministry of home affairs and will be shared with the ministries/departments concerned of the government.        
	He repeated his appeal to the people of Andhra Pradesh to maintain peace. He said political parties had promised to maintain law and order and that the Centre believed them.        
	Chidambaram tried to allay concerns over the recent paramilitary reinforcements sent to Andhra. The deployment is a purely precautionary measure, he said, adding that the forces would remain at their headquarters or police stations as a reserve force.

          CLAUDINE BEAUMONT                            A woman uses an ebook in Las Vegas. (Reuters)                                  
	London, Jan. 16: LGs 19-inch ebook screen could bring newspapers and magazines to life        
	LG said it was the largest ebook reader ever made, and that while the device wasnt rollable, it was flexible and bendable, creating a look and feel similar to that of a newspaper.        
	The screen is currently just a prototype device, and will not be made publicly available, but it hints at the future of electronic displays and possible uses for ebook readers. It is believed to be a similar screen to that used in LGs Skiff ebook reader, which made its debut last week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.        
	 By developing the worlds biggest flexible electronic paper display, weve gained a stepping stone for opening a new market in next-generation displays, said Chung In-jae, chief technology officer for LGs display division.        
	The prototype screen is paper-thin, at just 0.3mm thick. Its flexibility is achieved by using a thin film transistor on metal foil, rather than glass substrate, for the display. The screen measures 25cm by 40cm and weighs 130g.              
	, though LG said it could become thicker and heavier if a manufacturer decided to equip it with the necessary electronics for a touch-screen interface or internet access.        
	Tablet computers and ebook readers are expected to come in to their own this year, with Apple rumoured to be on the verge of launching a tablet-style computer, and a host of companies releasing ebook readers to take on Amazons Kindle.        
	Analysts at DisplaySearch predict that the global revenue of ebook readers will reach $9.6bn (5.8bn) by 2018, up from $431m (264m) last year.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Jungle raj in Bengal: Pranab
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 26: Pranab Mukherjee today spoke of CPM terror and a jungle raj in Bengal, becoming the second senior Union minister in two days to publicly echo Mamata Banerjees charges against the ruling Left.        
	He also confirmed that the Union home minister had indeed written to the Bengal government (about law and order), belying CPM leaders suggestions that the purported letter may not exist because it had not reached the state government.        
	P. Chidambarams letter, which speaks of armed CPM camps and asks the state to disarm the cadres, was leaked to the media on Friday, one day after Mamata indirectly spoke of quitting the government.        
	What kind of jungle raj is one living in here? Mukherjee told a party meeting in Nabagram in his Jangipur constituency. In the whole of Bengal this situation prevails. The CPM resorts to terror whenever elections are round the corner.        
	Following the finance ministers remarks, CPM state secretary Biman Bose did make an oblique comment on the CPM camps mentioned in Chidambarams letter, after yesterday refusing to react to a letter that does not exist.        
	There are no armed camps of party cadres in Jungle Mahal. Instead, those party supporters who have been rendered homeless have set up camps there, he said.        
	Asked about Mukherjees comments, he said I have heard what Pranabbabu said about the letter but insisted that the state government hadnt received any such letter.        
	A Trinamul leader said Mukherjees remarks had made Mamata happy. He said: Till now, Congress leaders hadnt been very vocal about CPM camps in Jungle Mahal. They have accepted our leaders charges now.        
	Mukherjee told a meeting in Burnpur, Burdwan: The home minister has sent the letter to the state government. He has done his bit. Now, the responsibility lies with the state government to reply.        
	He upped his attack later at Nabagram, saying hundreds of Congress workers had been killed during CPM rule.        
	What for? You will stay at your place; I will stay at mine. Where is the scope for murder? he said, adding that a panchayat pradhan had been killed while working in his office.

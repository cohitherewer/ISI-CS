The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | July meet that set PMs mind

          K.P. NAYAR                                              
	Washington, Jan. 22: The decision to appoint Shiv Shankar Menon as national security adviser was taken in principle by the Prime Minister in the last week of July 2009, notwithstanding ill-informed speculation about other contenders right until yesterdays announcement of M.K. Narayanans successor.        
	Manmohan Singhs resolve to bring Menon into his office (PMO) was firmed up following a meeting that took place on a day the Prime Minister was down but not out as the result of overwhelming political and bureaucratic opposition to his Sharm-el-Sheikh initiative with Pakistan on July 16.        
	Menon, only a few days away from retirement as foreign secretary, was not only down but also out.        
	He had taken the blame for the Sharm-el-Sheikh fiasco where Singh and Pakistans Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani had agreed to delink action on terrorism from the Indo-Pakistan dialogue and allegedly conceded ground to Pakistan on its complaints about an Indian subversive role in Balochistan.        
	Consequently, work on a new office space for Menon was ordered to be stopped and a decision to bring him into the PMO as a special envoy was put on hold.        
	Singh, who tends to lapse into moods at the slightest of setbacks, was upset that he was not getting the political backing from the Congress he had hoped for after Sharm-el-Sheikh.        
	For all that, Singh was absolutely convinced that he had done the right thing at his meeting with Gilani and realised that he would now have to bide his time to resume the initiative with Pakistan.        
	It was against this backdrop that a crucial meeting was called to take stock of the fallout from Sharm-el-Sheikh.        
	At this meeting, the normally unflappable Menon let fly his frustrations and disappointments during the two years and 10 months that he had been foreign secretary, according to a cabinet minister and a senior bureaucrat who attended that meeting.        
	Menons primary target at that meeting was Narayanan, who was opposed to the Sharm-el-Sheikh initiative, notwithstanding the very cordial relationship the two men have shared for many years.        
	The foreign secretary put in words what ministers and senior civil servants who attend regular meetings of the cabinet committee on security already knew: Narayanan had come in the way of every strategic initiative during the five years plus that he had been in the PMO.        
	Narayanan vigorously opposed the nuclear deal with the US when it was offered by the Americans in July 2005.        
	In fact, Narayanan changed his mind on the nuclear deal three times during its tortuous course, oscillating between support and opposition, one source privy to those flip-flops had told this reporter at various stages during those changes in his opinion.        
	As a life-long intelligence official, he could not countenance the idea that India would delink action against terrorism from the so-called composite dialogue process with Pakistan or concede an inch on Islamabads allegations of Delhis role in Balochistan.        
	Menon asked Narayanan what option he had on Pakistan, other than keeping the channels of communication open and resuming the dialogue. He accused Narayanan of dragging his feet on the border dispute with China, a subject which the national security adviser was directly in charge of.        
	A China expert whose childhood was spent in a school in Tibet, Menon implied that Narayanans fear of shadows from his days in the Intelligence Bureau was contributing to unfounded suspicions about China and taking Sino-Indian relations downhill.        
	It was clear from the outgoing foreign secretarys litany of complaints that Indian foreign policy could not continue the way it was plodding along.        
	Menon painted a picture of stagnation in dealings with the neighbourhood and the Prime Minister realised that the foreign secretary was talking precisely about the problems that had stymied his initiatives, making it impossible to create a legacy based on his foreign policy vision.                    
	This was the moment Singh made up his mind that Menon had to be brought in at an opportune moment as national security adviser.        
	On March 16 last year, as part of a pre-election series called Value Judgement on the UPAs record in office, this newspaper had predicted that if Singh returns to office, he may just be waiting to see the back of Narayanan.        
	It was clear at that time that Narayanan would not have a full second term as national security adviser, but no decision had then been taken on who his replacement would be.        
	However, home minister P. Chidambaram on his own or his efforts in cumulation with the course of events at the end-July meeting on Sharm-el-Sheikh would not have been enough to send Narayanan into exile in Calcutta.        
	According to one cabinet minister who interacted with Congress president Sonia Gandhi almost daily during the critical legislative approval phase of the Indo-US nuclear deal, she is of the view, in retrospect, that the political deal with the Samajwadi Party to facilitate the nuclear deal was a bad choice.        
	It was Narayanan, with his intelligence skills, who twisted the arms of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh into supporting the UPA in Parliament at that time.        
	According to another member of the ministry, Sonia told him that she disagreed also with the PMOs decision to vote against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency in September 2005 for the sake of the nuclear deal.        
	Narayanan helped deliver a dead Velupillai Prabhakaran as revenge became a substitute for Indias Sri Lanka policy in the final months of Colombos military campaign against the Tamil Tigers last year.        
	But as clamour grows across the world to investigate Sri Lankas human rights abuses and alleged war crimes, there is lurking concern in 10 Janpath, Sonias residence, that questionable aspects of Indias recent role in Sri Lanka may come out at some stage and that Narayanans presence in the PMO could then prove to be an embarrassment.        
	Narayanan could hopefully survive any such exposure in Calcutta but not at the heart of Indian foreign and security policies.

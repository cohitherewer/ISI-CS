	Washington, Nov. 4 (Agencies): The US today tightened the noose around the 26/11 perpetrators on the eve of Barack Obamas India visit, imposing sanctions against individuals and groups that it said support Pakistans Lashkar-e-Toiba.        
	Similar curbs have been slapped on the Jaish-e-Mohammed.        
	The aim of the decision, announced by the treasury department, is to target the money men who it says helped finance and train terrorists for the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai, where the US President begins his three-day visit.        
	While in the city, Obama and his team will stay at the Taj Mahal Palace, one of the scenes of the carnage. The attacks at the hotel and other places in Mumbai had left 166 people dead, including some Americans.        
	Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Stuart Levey, said the action should help cripple the terror duo financially. The sanctions mean that US citizens have been banned from dealing with them, and any assets the Lashkar and the Jaish may have under US jurisdiction will be frozen.        
	The treasury department statement on the sanctions specifically designated  organisations and individuals have been forbidden from dealing with him  the Lashkars Azam Cheema, describing him as the man who helped train the 10 Mumbai gunmen. That included Ajmal Kasab, whose death sentence is up for confirmation by Bombay High Court.         
	The statement also blamed Cheema for organising the July 2006 Mumbai train blasts that claimed around 200 lives. Hafiz Abdul Rahman Makki, the head of the Lashkars political affairs department, has also been designated.        
	From Jaish, the treasury department designated founder Mohammed Masood Azhar Alvi and a trust, Al Rehmat Trust, which it described as a front company that has been involved in fund-raising for the terror outfit.        
	LeT (Lashkar) and JeM (Jaish) have proven both their willingness and ability to execute attacks against innocent civilians. Todays action  including the designation of Azam Cheema, one of LeTs leading commanders who was involved in the 2008 and 2006 Mumbai attacks  is an important step in incapacitating the operational and financial networks of these deadly organisations, under secretary Levey said.        
	Washingtons action comes hours before Obama leaves for India, which has been pressing the US to lean on Pakistan to take strong and transparent action against the terror groups operating from its territory.

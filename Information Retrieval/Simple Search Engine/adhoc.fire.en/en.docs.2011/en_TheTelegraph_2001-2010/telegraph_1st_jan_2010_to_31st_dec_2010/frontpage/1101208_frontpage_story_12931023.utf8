The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Father teaches what Harvard business school didnt
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Father teaches what Harvard business school didnt
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                            Arunavaa D. Bajpayi. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                   
	Ambition took Arunavaa D. Bajpayi to Harvard. His fathers dream has brought him back to a small town in Burdwan, leaving behind a lucrative career in New York.         
	My father wanted me to do something for the people of my village in Kalna. So here I am, said 38-year-old Arunavaa, who gave up a high-paying strategy consultants job to tread the path paved by his role model in micro finance  Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh.        
	His first home project? A micro private equity company based in Calcutta. His first client? Handloom Cluster, a Kalna-based co-operative that employs over 1,500 people.        
	My immediate goal is to help Handloom Cluster go global and also create a marketing strategy for vegetable-colour products, Arunavaa told Metro.        
	Arunavaas decision to return to Kalna had as much to do with Yunus winning the peace Nobel in 2006 as with the dream nurtured by his schoolteacher father Dhirendranath Bajpayi. Yunus first caught my attention when he won the Nobel. Then I saw his interview on television and I instantly knew what I wanted to do in future, he recalled.        
	Since returning to Kalna, Arunavaa has been busy giving shape to the company he jointly owns with friends Harpreet Singh and Robert Rubinstein. The friends have so far raised $28 million from North American investors, most of it to be spent on buying undervalued companies.        
	But is it possible to set up such a cutting-edge business by being based in Kalna rather than Kentucky?         
	We will operate from Calcutta (Ballygunge New Market) and offices in Mumbai and Noida, which we plan to open next year along with branches in Manhattan and Toronto, said Arunavaa, who moves around town on a motorbike borrowed from one of the members of the Kalna Chamber of Commerce.        
	Corpdyne Consulting Services LLP will deal primarily with companies that cannot afford top consultants.         
	This part of our operations will help organisations develop strategies, innovate and achieve optimum organisational efficiency. Most private equity companies work with businesses valued at Rs 200-Rs 400 crore. Our company is going to deal with businesses valued between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 5 crore, explained Arunavaa.        
	Corpdyne will also offer primary and secondary market research for domestic and North American companies wanting to invest in India as well as Indian businesses wanting to invest in North America. The companys third objective is to buy undervalued companies.        
	The team of consultants includes Chandril Ray, a graduate from IIM Ahmedabad, and two recruits from IIM Calcutta. Arunavaa also intends hiring two analysts and a full-time associate. Some of his professors from Harvard University would be on the advisory board, he said.        
	So does he have a Plan B just in case something goes wrong? With the experience I have, I can always go back to working. But I do want to succeed on my own and also fulfil my fathers dream, said Arunavaa, who studied at Ambika MM High School in Kalna and graduated in rural technology and management from Burdwan University before relocating to Toronto to start Eton Technologies with friend Louis Brum.

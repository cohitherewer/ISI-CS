  - Unified command, tribal rights in anti-Maoist plan          NISHIT DHOLABHAI AND SUJAN DUTTA                                                     
	New Delhi, July 14: The Centre today opened both its heart and its arsenal with a slew of measures, including unified commands and more IAF choppers along with steps to ensure tribal rights, in order to fight Maoists.        
	This is the third theatre of strife in the country after the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir where unified command structures will be created to help co-ordination between different security forces.        
	Whereas home minister P. Chidambaram outlined measures on the security front at a meeting with seven states here today, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh attempted to correct the wrongs by successive governments.        
	Singh asked the states, including Bengal, to employ more young men and women from tribal areas in security forces while urging them to improve the infrastructure in police stations.        
	Our tribal populations have traditionally depended upon the forests for their livelihoods and we must ensure that this link does not get disrupted without alternate means of livelihood being made available. Any development of tribal areas must also ensure that the tribal population has a stake in it, even after it has been adequately compensated for displacement, the Prime Minister said in his opening remarks.        
	For far too long have our tribal brothers and sisters seen the administration in the form of a rapacious forest guard, a brutal policeman, a greedy patwari. It is time that we provided a better delivery of services, he said.        
	The decision to have unified commands in Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh was taken today at the meeting of chief ministers with the Prime Minister. For Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, which also asked for unified command, the home minister said it was not necessary at present.        
	Singhs assertion that the Maoists are the single biggest internal security challenge for the country was borne out by the steps taken today. Chidambaram said there was complete unanimity on an eight-point proposal by the government.                          
	A unified command in every state will be headed by their respective chief secretaries and will have a retired major general as a member to help in strategising.         
	Having learnt from numerous casualties, especially of the CRPF partially because of lack of co-ordination, an inspector-general of the CRPF will be appointed as IG (Operations) while a state police officer would be IG (anti-Naxalite operations).        
	The Centre has also committed 23 more choppers in addition to the existing six choppers deployed in the states. The choppers are meant for logistics support, troop movement, supplies and evacuation but states have asked for more air support. The Centre has decided against any operational involvement of the air force.        
	The home minister insisted that the states agreed to the two-pronged approach of development with police action. We agreed that the Naxalite challenge can be met in the middle and long-term, he told reporters while conceding earlier that the efforts to fight have met with mixed results. These mixed results include the setbacks in Shilda in Bengal and in Chhattisgarh.         
	To create training capacities, 20 new counter-insurgency training centres will be set up. Bengal proposed training centres at Talwa in West Midnapore, Taldanga in Bankura and Matigara in Siliguri to address shortfall of training, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said.         
	On the development front, the Centre has advised the states to strictly and vigorously implement the Panchayats Extension of Scheduled Areas (Pesa) Act. This is expected to ensure that rights over minor forest produce are assigned to gram sabhas and interference by government departments and corporations as well as co-operatives is removed.         
	The worth of forest produce in these states is said to be more than Rs 50,000 crore, which the Centre has now realised should go to the tribal population of these areas. An amount of Rs 950 crore were approved today for construction of roads and bridges in 34 most-affected districts.

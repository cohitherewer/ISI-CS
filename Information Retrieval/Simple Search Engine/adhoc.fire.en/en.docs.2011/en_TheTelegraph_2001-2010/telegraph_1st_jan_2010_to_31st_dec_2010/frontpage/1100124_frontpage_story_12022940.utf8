  - Dumped mistress of Oracle president bares affair on billboards                                                   
	New York, Jan. 23 (Agencies): Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Oracle Corp president Charles Phillips has learned that lesson in a very public way.        
	Huge billboards depicting the married software executive snuggling with YaVaughnie Wilkins, his former mistress, appeared this week in New York, Atlanta and San Francisco.        
	The billboards with the words You are my soulmate forever! appeared to be an attempt by Wilkins to embarrass Phillips after their relationship ended and he returned to his wife.        
	I had an eight-and-a-half-year serious relationship with YaVaughnie Wilkins. My d ivorce proceedings began in 2008. The relationship with Wilkins has since ended and we both wish each other well, Phillips, 50, said in a statement released through a spokesperson. The spokesperson did not elaborate on the status of Phillipss marriage.         
	The billboards also featured the address of a website, www.charlesphillipsandyavaughniewilkins.com, that contains more than 1,200 photographs of Wilkins and Phillips together from 2001 to 2009, some 65 karaoke tracks of the pair singing and about 35 articles written by Wilkins, according to the sites designer, Bela Kovacs.         
	The pictures appeared to show Wilkins and Phillips at parties, on vacation and hanging out with friends. The site also includes digital images of love letters supposedly sent to Wilkins from Phillips.         
	She (Wilkins) told me it was a gift to Charles, Kovacs, from San Jose, California, said. He said the site was put up online in late October, but got little attention until the billboards appeared.        
	The billboard in New York was dismantled on Friday.        
	Wilkins could not be reached for comment. The billboard operator said the company had no comment.        
	Phillips, who is also a member of Oracles board of directors, joined the software company in 2003. Before that, he worked for Morgan Stanley investment bank. In February 2009, Phillips was appointed to the Presidents Economic Recovery Advisory Board to help provide the Barack Obama administration with economic advice.

          GAJINDER SINGH                      A remote-operated vehicle scanning a war scrap container                          
	Chandigarh, Nov. 22: Two Punjab villages with over 700 people, their 2,500 cattle in tow, are being evacuated for hours each day so the army can wage a new battle  against a 11-year mound of hazardous war scrap.        
	Western Command, which has been at the forefront of wars with Pakistan, is in charge of the mission that began two weeks ago and has been named Operation Saiyam (patience) as it could take four months to finish the job.        
	The scrap consists of over 17,000 pieces of munition  spent rockets, mortars, grenades, bombs, artillery shells, bullets and other weaponry in disuse. They trace their roots to the 1990 Gulf War and had been imported from West Asia by Ludhiana companies, which melt them and turn them into a variety of appliances.        
	The quantity is huge and cannot be destroyed in one go. We have to segregate them first before we can even think of detonating them. We have named the exercise Operation Saiyam. It will take us nearly three to four months to complete the task. We have to be very careful to ensure there are no (remnants of) chemical bombs, the Western Commands chief engineer, Major General V.K. Bhatt, today.        
	Steel and other metal re-rolling units in Punjab had imported the scrap at throwaway prices between 1999 and 2004. They had not specified the nature of the consignment  only mentioning scrap  while taking permission for the imports. It was only during inspections by customs that their hazardous nature was discovered.        
	Since then, they have been lying in large containers at a Ludhiana depot, with the customs withholding the consignment and asking the Punjab authorities to make arrangements to have them destroyed in a safe manner.        
	The containers have not even been ferried outside the depot for fear of blasts. Such caution was not exercised in other scrap imports, including metal remnants of New Yorks World Trade Centre that ended up as cutlery after conversion by metal units in Punjab.        
	The war scrap is being ferried on heavy trucks to Shekhowal and Kalewal, the villages chosen for their disposal, where the consignments are dumped into 10-foot-deep pits and then detonated.         
	The district administration has been helping the army cordon off the area. All precautions are being taken as splinters from the spent shells and bombs could fly off in several directions if not placed in the pit properly.        
	Surprisingly, the villagers have not protested despite being herded into a local gurudwara and brought back in the evening each day since November 9 so the armys 8.30am-5pm detonation-and-disposal drill can go on smoothly.        
	The army stops the exercise whenever there is a festival or a special occasion, an official said.         
	The firms that imported the war scrap are paying for the disposal.

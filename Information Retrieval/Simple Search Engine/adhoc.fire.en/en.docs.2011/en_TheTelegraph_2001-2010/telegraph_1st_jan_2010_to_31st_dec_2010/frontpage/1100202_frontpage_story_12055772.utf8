The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Talks nod for Ulfa, NDFB
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Talks nod for Ulfa, NDFB
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 1: The Centre is ready for a dialogue with the pro-talks groups of both Ulfa and the National Democratic Front of Boroland even without their top leaders Paresh Barua and Ranjan Daimary.         
	Our offer to talk to Ulfa remains. But we have not yet got an offer to talk from those who have been apprehended. Paresh Barua is not with us. We do not think he is in India. Just because Paresh Barua is out of the country it does not mean that talks can be avoided indefinitely, Union home minister P. Chidambaram said today.         
	A source in the home ministry said talks with the Ulfa leadership have been planned for later this month but only after a discussion with the Assam government.         
	Baruah is suspected to be hiding in Myanmar, while most of the top leaders, including the outfits chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, are in jail.         
	He and other leaders were arrested from the Indo-Bangladesh border in December.         
	While being produced in a Guwahati court, Rajkhowa had rejected any possibility of talks with handcuffs on.         
	The Centres preconditions of Ulfa abjuring violence and giving up its demand for a sovereign Assam remain.         
	It is my sincere hope and appeal that those who have come back to India, who have been apprehended, who are in custody today... those leaders will come forward to hold talks with the government. If they come forward to hold talks, we are prepared to hold talks, he said.         
	The development comes a day after sources in Dispur suggested that the state government was not keen on rushing into talks with the jailed Ulfa leaders, as it is more focused on getting Barua to the negotiating table.        
	Chidambaram, however, said the Centre was also willing to talk to the NDFB without its chairman Ranjan Daimary.         
	If Ranjan Daimarys group does not come for talks, that does not mean we will not go forward... Daimary is a fugitive from justice, if there is an opportunity, he will be apprehended, said Chidambaram.

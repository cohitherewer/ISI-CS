	Rae Bareli, Oct 26 (PTI): A special CBI court today fixed November 18 as the next date of hearing in the Babri mosque demolition case.
    "On the request of defence counsel Hari Dutt Sharma seeking adjournment on personal grounds, Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Vishnu Prasad Agarwal posted the matter for further hearing on November 18," the prosecution said.
    One more application was moved by the defence seeking the court's status in connection with some accused in the case, which was argued by the CBI counsel.
    A key witness senior IPS officer Anju Gupta, who was deployed as security officer with BJP leader L K Advani on December 6, 1992, appeared before the court, it said.
    Hearing in the demolition case had resumed after a gap of more than three months following nomination of ACJM Agarwal by the High Court.

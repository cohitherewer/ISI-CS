The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mundas Navratnas   9 ministers sworn in; rift in JMM, JD-U
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mundas Navratnas     9 ministers sworn in; Rift in JMM, JD-U
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                               
	Ranchi, Oct. 8: With pitri paksh out of the way, chief minister Arjun Munda used the good tidings of Navratri and expanded his cabinet by naming nine more ministers, but got a taste of the challenges that lie ahead for the BJP-JMM-Ajsu-JD(U) coalition as disgruntled MLAs stayed away from the oath ceremony for being denied ministerial berths.        
	To Mundas credit though, he managed to keep the names of his ministers, particularly those from the BJP and JD(U), a closely guarded secret till this morning, thereby ensuring that the swearing in ceremony at Birsa Mandap at Raj Bhavan passed off without any public outbursts by those who failed to make the mark.        
	In the end, the 12-member council of ministers  four are first-timers  appeared to be a judicious mix of tribals, backwards, forward castes and those from minority communities.         
	As per a deal worked out with coalition partners, the BJP has four members in the cabinet, including the chief minister, JMM five, Ajsu two and JD(U) one (see chart).        
	Governor M..H Farook administered the oath of office to the nine today, beginning the ceremony at exactly 11.25 am, the muhurat for Kalash Asthapan, the first day of Navratri.        
	Among the prominent MLAs who skipped the function were Raghubar Das (BJP), Simon Marandi, Teklal Mahto (both JMM), Sudha Chaudhary (JD-U) and Kamal Kishore Bhagat (Ajsu).        
	Munda, who was sworn in on September 11, had deferred the cabinet expansion citing the inauspicious period of pitri paksh. I had promised to begin the tenure with a full-fledged cabinet on an auspicious day and stuck to it, he told The Telegraph.         
	With his cabinet in place, Munda said he would distribute portfolios by tomorrow. He also disclosed plans to go to New Delhi to meet Manmohan Singh. It is imperative for a new chief minister to call on the Prime Minister whom I will request for a special package to fight drought in the state, he said.        
	Claiming there was no dissension as the cabinet formed in consultation with the party high command, the chief minister said, We have a limited number of berths and every MLA had expectations. But we have managed to strike a regional balance in picking ministers from the BJP fold. I cannot comment on how our allies chose their ministers.        
	The BJP corrected a past mistake, that of ignoring upper castes, by including Satyanand Jha Batul in the cabinet. While Jha will represent Santhal Pargana, Baidyanath Ram will represent Palamau and Vimala Pradhan the Chotanagpur region. Munda is from Singhbhum.        
	The JMMs team also looks balanced, given that its vote bank comprises Muslims, STs, SCs and OBCs.        
	JMMs Tundi MLA Mathura Prasad Mahto will represent the coal belt as well as OBCs, while Haji Hussain Ansari and Hemlal Murmu come from Santhal Pargana and Champai Soren from Singhbhum.        
	But the induction of Chandra Prakash Chaudhary, a former minister, provides the Opposition with a handle against the Ajsu and the ruling coalition as his personal secretary, Manoj Kumar Singh, is facing a vigilance probe for corruption.        
	The immediate fallout of the expansion seems to have hit the JMM hardest with those left out speaking openly against the party. The decision to sideline seniors will neither be in the interest of the government nor the party, said MLA Simon Marandi.         
	On whether the case lodged against him in the wake of the cash for vote sting operation proved to be a stumbling block, Marandi shot back, If Guruji could become chief minister thrice despite having faced several cases, why cant I.         
	Teklal Mahto was equally cut up. I was not even invited to the ceremony. If the party is indifferent towards me, I, too, will remain indifferent, he maintained.        
	JD(U) MLA Sudha Chaudhary, who lost out because of Raja Peters surprise inclusion, alleged Munda convinced party chief Sharad Yadav to deny her a berth. Nitish Kumar had no role in the decision. I still consider Raja Peter a nominee of the BJP than the JD(U), she said, indicating her displeasure.        
	Das remained incommunicado, though the chief minister tried to downplay his absence. He was preoccupied with a scheduled programme in Jamshedpur, he explained.        
	Vimala Pradhans entry is said to have sealed the fate of Khunti MLA Neelkanth Singh Munda, who was a minister in the Soren cabinet.         
	Principal secretary        
	State health secretary D.K. Tiwari is now principal secretary to the chief minister. A 1986-batch IAS member, Tiwari is known for his uprightness and simplicity.

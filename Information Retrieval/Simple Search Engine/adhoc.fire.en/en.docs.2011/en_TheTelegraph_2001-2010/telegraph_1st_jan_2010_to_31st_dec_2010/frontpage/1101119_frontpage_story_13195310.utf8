The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Writers fire after alert
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Writers fire after alert
          OUR BUREAU                      The lsquo;tinderbox rsquo; seat of power. A Telegraph picture                          
	A fire broke out in an air-conditioner at Writers Building on Thursday morning, a week after fire minister Pratim Chatterjee had dubbed the secretariat a tinderbox and warned that it could turn into ashes any day.        
	The fire was small  two tenders took 10 minutes to restore normality  but it was yet another pointer to the secretariats vulnerability to disaster, stemming from lack of safety measures as well as maintenance.        
	Chatterjee repeated on Thursday what he had said on November 11, that Writers was a jatugriha (tinderbox).        
	I am afraid one day I will wake up and hear that Writers has been reduced to ashes. I have written to the chief minister many times without mincing my words. I will write to him again. I have also alerted the PWD many times. But my words have fallen on deaf years.        
	The minister admitted that the building lacked safety measures. If there is a big fire, I dont know how we are going to fight it.... We immediately need a fire control room inside Writers but the issue is not getting priority, Chatterjee added.        
	An official in Chatterjees department said the building housing offices of VVIPs like the chief minister did not have basic safety tools, such as fire alarms and smoke sensors.        
	A PWD official said the fire broke out because rats had chewed up the exhaust pipe of the AC, a claim that only betrays his departments failure in ensuring proper upkeep of the building.        
	Rinchen Tempo, the principal secretary in the social welfare department, saw sparks in the 1.5tonne window AC of her room around 10am. Soon after, smoke started coming out of the gadget.        
	The official immediately switched off the AC and alerted police.         
	The AC was less than a year old but it was creating problems for the past few days. The PWD was approached on Tuesday but it did nothing, said an official in Tempos department.        
	There are around 1,000 air-conditioners of the same make as the one in Tempos office at Writers.         
	Most of them were installed this year after babus complained that they could not sit in their offices because of the unbearable summer heat.        
	Thursdays fire was not the first in Bengals seat of power.         
	In August 2008, a fire had broken out in an annexe of Writers Buildings that housed the municipal affairs and other departments. Important files and furniture worth lakhs were gutted.        
	There have been several fires since but they were minor and mostly went unnoticed.        
	The series of fires, however, failed to wake up the administration to the dangers in its offices.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Meenas term extended 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Meenas term extended 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 14: The state government has decided to extend the tenure of the DGHC administrator, sending a subtle message that it would be firm in its dealings with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha.        
	Sources in the chief ministers secretariat said in Writers Buildings today that B.L. Meenas term would be extended by at least another six months. Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: The proposal to extend the term of the DGHC administrator is being actively considered. Meenas term expires on January 31.         
	The extension does not bother us as we are not concerned with the DGHC. We do not want the council but want a separate state as its alternative, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said in Darjeeling today.         
	During the third round of tripartite meeting in New Delhi on August 11, the state, Centre and the Morcha had agreed to repeal the DGHC Act of 1988, provided an alternative arrangement was agreed upon by the state government and the hill party. However, with the Morcha sticking to statehood as its alternative, dissolving the DGHC has hit a roadblock.         
	The cry to remove Meena first started when the government failed to meet its deadline to regularise 3,472 casual workers of the DGHC by November 17, 2009. On October 30, Sen, as additional chief secretary, had assured the Morcha that the regularisation would be done within the time frame. Later, the state retracted its stand, saying no time frame could be provided for the regularisation.         
	Machendra Subba, president, Janmukti Asthahi Karmachari Sangatan, which has been spearheading the agitation for regularisation of workers, today said: If Meena has been given an extension, he should work from Darjeeling. Meena has set up an office-cum-residence at Pintail Village near Siliguri in the plains.         
	This is the second time that the state has sent such a strong message. The first one was when the government backtracked and stated categorically that it could not set any time frame for regularisation of workers, said an observer.

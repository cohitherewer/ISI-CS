	Calcutta, March 16: The Knights put themselves to sword in a spectacular act of serial hara-kiri tonight, a floodlit crime that darkened Edens glow and snuffed the cheer that rang off the stands for a good part of the evening.        
	Most didnt bother staying to witness the final stabs inflicted; a hail of discarded ticket-stubs fluttered about in their forlorn wake, each an accusatory FIR posted on the deathwish of their darlings.        
	The Kings of Chennai have kept their all-win record against the Knights clean, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has stolen the hattrick his predecessor-mentor Sourav Ganguly had set out to achieve today; he has vanquished him three straight times in the IPL.         
	The Knights came off the ground with a distinction quite singular, though: no other team this season has conceded such a huge defeat on runs as 55. They failed to bat out their paltry 20 overs, too.        
	Shah Rukh Khan stood wordless and cross-legged at the post-match presentation; his feet arent unlocking into dance anytime soon. Its a five-in-row vow the Knights owner is on; his men must commence their campaign from scratch against the Rajasthan Royals in Ahmedabad on Saturday and their skipper must demonstrate he retains his legendary skills, especially near the top of the order.        
	In three matches, Sourav has toiled to a monumental 34; his boss refrained from quoting any promises from him tonight.         
	The Knights will probably get no keener fan than their employer. He leaned on the rails of that contentious open-air deck of his so long, hes probably suffered a bad back. Often, as Chennai lost wickets early, he turned around to Club House fans and blew kisses and if the rapture they let off was any indication, each of those kisses had defied gravity to pepper the cheeks of maidens and mummys straining on the upper tiers.        
	Juhi jigged beside Shah Rukh, but he kept his feet firmly planted. Not now, not yet. But his team didnt offer him another opportunity to think about just a twist on the deck if not a whole routine. After raising expectations heap-high, they plunged right down it.         
	Shah Rukh vanished off the deck during the interval, leaving behind a diehard band of flag-wavers that had less and less to wave about as the evening wore on. He returned immediately upon Souravs dismissal, but by then the Chennai section of the hospitality deck had seized the night.        
	The DJ seemed to have suddenly misplaced his korbo, lorbo, jeetbo disc and was belting out a thunderous Tamil number to which a sprinkling of yellow shirts boogied. Most of the ground did not get a word of it, but it sounded something violently celebratory. The Super Kings were being invited to victory, after all.         
	Once upon a time this evening, Souravs men had their rivals firmly matted on the green. The Super Kings were gasping for life at three down for 55 and 10 overs gone. Then Dhoni walked in, and slowly prised his team free, first nibbling, then grabbing a game that seemed well out of his grasp. Eleven Knights, and not a clue to how to stop a King.         
	The Super Kings captain reached his 50 off 28 balls, and celebrated it with two more lusty hits off Shane Bond  a flat six at square leg and then a smash through cover for four. S. Badrinath, who would complete an unbeaten match-winning partnership with his skipper, then got into the act, and pummelled Ishant for a huge six over backward square leg, the ball smashing into the debris of the demolished western stand. Hundred-run stand.        
	The roar in the stands was slowly getting muffled. It began to look distinctly like the Knights had thrown their initial advantage away.         
	They gave 109 away to the Kings in the last 10 overs and earned themselves a target they could well have kept leashed to comfort.         
	The Knights made as dismal a start as the Super Kings end was stunning  Brad the fancied Hodge holding out at short midwicket to Ashwin off Albie Morkels second delivery. Sourav, in the next, survived a scare first up, never seeming to sight one that reared and lodged into his upper groin.        
	He wouldnt get off the mark for a whole over, during which another wicket fell  Manoj Tiwary attempting a hattrick of boundaries off Manpreet Gony. Middle stump plucked off the hole.        
	The Knights would have lost another almost immediately had Hayden not floored one that came booming at him at first slip off Wriddhiman Sahas flashed blade. Saha went, consumed, like Tiwary, by the greed of over-ambition. Going for a sixth after five hits to the fence.        
	Lakshmipathy Balaji came on in the next over to immediately claim Owais Shah  the ball smooched the Englishmans outer edge and cuddled softly into Dhonis gloves. Four down for 46 in the seventh.         
	Sourav asked for a change of bat with which he had scored no more than one. He eked another 10 with the new one, then fell, caught at midwicket on a wretchedly mistimed attempt at sending Justin Kemp beyond the fence. Fifty-five for five.                                      
	Kemp came back the next over to pile on the Knights misery, grabbing Angelo Mathews plumb in front. Mathews had a lowly outing: no wickets for 29 and only six off the bat. At the end of the eleventh, the Knights had dug a sorry pit and were staring at a soaring required rate, nearly eleven an over. They were seven down for 79. Then eight for 82; Laxmi Ratan Shukla held at the square leg fence by Morkel off Muralitharan.        
	Rohan Gavaskar arrived and began to bat as if to prompt another bite from his father in the commentary box -- I wouldnt mind bowling to him either; Rohan scratched a couple, then leapt to keep up with the run rate and plummeted to early death, caught brilliantly by Vijay to become Kemps third victim.         
	Nine gone for 84, and the last pair of Murali Kartik and Ishant did well to hang on and take the score to 109. But they were never going to bat out the full 20 overs.        
	In the end, Kartik ran himself out and ended what had long turned into a farce.         
	Hereon, the Knights will wage their campaign away from home for nearly a fortnight, returning to Eden on All Fools Day; the Gardens will probably have regained their humour by then.

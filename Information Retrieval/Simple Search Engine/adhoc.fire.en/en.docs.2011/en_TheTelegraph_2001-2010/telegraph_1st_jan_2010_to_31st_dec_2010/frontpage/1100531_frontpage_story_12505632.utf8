  - Recorded intercepts of conversation show Maoist link         PRONAB MONDAL                      A train passes the accident site for the first time since the Jnaneswari Express crashed on Friday. Picture by Amit Datta                                
	Rajabandh (West Midnapore), May 30: Police today claimed to have recorded intercepts of a cellphone conversation between two members of village defence squads establishing the link between Maoists and the sabotage that caused the Jnaneswari accident.        
	According to the version put out by the police, a squad member at the derailment site is heard saying: We have completed the work on both the railway tracks. The train is due in another 10 minutes.        
	Another member, at Manikpara that is 6km away, replies: Leave the spot, quickly.        
	The police have the cellphone numbers of around 500 suspected Maoists and all conversations from or to these numbers are automatically recorded through a special software. The conversations are later played back to find out if anything of importance had been said.        
	This process yielded the exchange between the two members of the village defence squads.        
	A police officer said: From our records of cellphone details, we have found out that these numbers belong to members of the village defence squads.        
	The police have identified their locations from the cellphone tower positions.        
	The entire conversation was narrated by Praveen Tripathi, the SP of Jhargram police district, to Raj Kanojia, the additional director-general of the CID, who visited the site with a team of officials. Kanojia asked for a CD of the conversation.        
	We have got some evidence and our officers are working on it, said Kanojia.         
	The police will now try to establish the identities of the caller and the receiver with the help of digital voice matching software.        
	In the past we have arrested or detained several suspected Maoists and recorded conversations with them, an officer said. They have either been released or are out on bail. Now we will match the voices to confirm the names we have with us with the voices of the squad members.         
	The police said they had voice samples of more than 700 Maoists, including those of village defence squad members who were recruited as early as 1999.        
	The CID team was accompanied by the director of the state forensic laboratory, Dhurjati Prasad Sengupta.        
	We will submit our final report within a week, Sengupta said.        
	Sengupta, who collected samples from the crash site, said the possibility of a blast having taken place appeared remote as there was no evidence to corroborate the version provided by the driver of the Jnaneswari Express, B. Das.        
	Das had said he had heard an explosion and seen smoke at the time of the derailment. But the police and forensic experts said there were no wires or marks on the coaches to suggest a blast.        
	The preliminary findings of the forensic laboratory have confirmed sabotage by removing Pandrol clips, Kanojia said. We are now trying to find out if anyone had cut a portion of the railway tracks as well.        
	The accident toll has risen to 150 after some more bodies, trapped under the engine of the goods train that had rammed into the derailed Jnaneswari coaches, were extricated by rescuers this morning.        
	The Government Railway Police of Jhargram today added the charges of murder, attempt to murder, causing grievous hurt and criminal conspiracy to the FIR that had been lodged by the train driver.

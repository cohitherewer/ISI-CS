	Ranchi/Jamshedpur/ Bokaro, March 30: DGP Neyaz Ahmad has said they have no information yet about Maoist leader Kishan having taken refuge in Jharkhand in search of medical help after suffering bullet wounds in his shoulder.        
	He might still be in Bengal, he said, referring to the police of the neighbouring state that feel the rebel leader, in charge of operations in Lalgarh, had sneaked in to Jharkhand on a motorcycle along with key aides.        
	But we are keeping close watch on the developments, he added.        
	That explained why the police in Ghatshila, Dalbhumgarh and Chakulia in East Singhbhum district bordering Bengal had mounted a search operation, concentrating in clinics, nursing homes and hotels.        
	Anup Birtharay, the sub-divisional police officer of Ghatshila, said search operations in clinics and medical centres were on, but they had not received any specific details pertaining to Kishans whereabouts.        
	We are yet to get any specifics from the Bengal police. The West Midnapore police have not contacted us. But we are keeping a watch and thats why the ongoing search operations, he said.        
	Birtharay, who has instructed the police to keep a close watch on the movements of villagers in the Ghatshila sub-division, said their actions were based more on anticipation rather than any specific information. We are also searching vehicles in both border and town areas, he said.        
	News of Kishans injury has, however, had an impact in the rebel-infested zones of Uparghat, Jhumra hills and Gomia where dozens of rebels are said to be fleeing.        
	According to sources in the CRPF in Bokaro, elders of Nawadih, Gomia, Jhumra, Dumri, Madhuban hillocks and Parasnath had informed the security forces about this sudden exodus, triggered by the fear of the police launching intense combing operations.

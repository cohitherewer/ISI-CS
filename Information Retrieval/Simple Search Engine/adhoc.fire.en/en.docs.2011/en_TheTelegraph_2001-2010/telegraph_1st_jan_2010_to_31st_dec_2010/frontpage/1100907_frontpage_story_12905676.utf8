The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Arunachal highway work in November
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Arunachal highway work in November
  - China threat prompts move; project to link 11 districts           PULLOCK DUTTA                                     
	Jorhat, Sept. 6: Work on the trans-Arunachal highway is set to begin in November with the defence ministry mounting pressure for an early start in view of the growing threat perception from China.         
	A senior official of the public works department in Itanagar said the tender process for the 1656km highway is about to be completed and the work would start by November.         
	The highway will no doubt be a boon for landlocked Arunachal Pradesh but the most important part is that it will facilitate efficient troop movement along the India-China border, the official said.         
	He said there has been tremendous pressure from the central government to expedite construction of the highway.         
	The highway will start from Nichipu near Tawang to Kanubari near Naharkatia in Assam, interlinking 11 districts of the state.         
	The Bandardewa-Itanagar-Holongi stretch of the trans-Arunachal highway will be four lane while the rest of the roadway will be double lane.         
	Apart from the highway, construction of two-lane roads in an additional 847-km stretch to provide improved connectivity to the remaining five districts of the state would also start very soon.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made the announcement of the highway project in 2008 during his visit to Arunachal Pradesh. Arunachal Pradesh shares a 1030km border with China.        
	Defence ministry sources said with two new divisions under the 4 Corps coming up in Arunachal Pradesh shortly, there would be heavy presence of troops in the frontier state.         
	The army already has a division based at Tenga in Arunachal Pradesh.         
	The highway would come as a great help for the troops as it would expedite quicker deployment and movement. Now it is a time consuming affair to travel over the narrow roads in Arunachal Pradesh, a senior army official based in the state said.         
	Sources said apart from the highway, the Border Roads Organisation has also taken up construction of several roads in the border areas of the state.         
	All these roads would be connected with the highway.         
	BRO has been entrusted to carry out work on at least 60 roads in the state, a source in the defence ministry said.         
	The PWD official said the highway, targeted to be completed by 2015, and the linking roads that are to come up subsequently, would be of great help for the people of Arunachal Pradesh since they need not have to always travel through Assam at various points.         
	At present, for instance, a person travelling from Itanagar to Changlang or Tirap district has to pass through Assam.

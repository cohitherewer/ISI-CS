	Cancun (Mexico), Dec. 9: Indias environment minister Jairam Ramesh has signalled that the country is prepared to abandon its long-entrenched position on climate change and commit to legally-binding curbs in its emissions of greenhouse gases.         
	All countries, we believe, must take on binding commitments under appropriate legal forms, Ramesh said in a plenary speech at the UN climate change conference here where negotiators from 190 nations have gathered to find ways to combat global warming.         
	These words in his statement were not part of his printed speech circulated to delegates.         
	The statement is widely seen as a compromise in Indias position as developing countries are not required to undertake binding curbs on emissions under the Kyoto Protocol, the only treaty governing international climate change actions. The Kyoto Protocol demands legally-binding targets only from industrialised countries.         
	Ramesh, however, subsequently clarified that there is no question of India accepting a legally-binding agreement now and qualified his plenary statement as a generalised one to keep the maneuvering option open in the face of increasing pressure brought by most countries to accept a legally binding agreement.         
	We have not accepted a legally-binding agreement, but at the same time we are required to introduce flexibility for maneuvering and have to realise the changed reality, the minister told reporters.         
	But climate change analysts in Cancun said the ministers statement should be viewed in the context of the intense pressure that has built up on India and China to join a legally-binding treaty that many countries want ready by December 2011.         
	Some 70 countries, mainly European Union members and small island states, appear ranged against India and China, demanding a decision now that a legally-binding instrument should be finalised by the next climate change conference in Durban, South Africa, one analyst said.         
	Such a legally-binding instrument will of course demand commitments from both China and India, the analyst from India who is attending the conference but requested anonymity told The Telegraph. India and China are of course rejecting such a decision, the analyst said.         
	The minister himself acknowledged the pressure.         
	The small island states, the least developed countries, African countries, Brazil and South Africa, even our neighbours like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal  everybody was pressurising us to accept a legally-binding agreement, Ramesh said.         
	We always expected developed countries to pressurise us on legally binding curbs on emissions, but the same demand coming from smaller countries was never expected, Ramesh said.         
	Sources said that the cabinet had given three red lines to Ramesh for Cancun  India would not agree to absolute emissions cuts, India would not sign any accord which does not have a second term for Kyoto, and no legally-binding agreement.         
	Environmental groups have decried Rameshs statement, saying it is a dramatic reversal of Indias traditional position that its domestic initiatives to curb the growth of greenhouse gas emissions are voluntary and are not linked to any international agreement.         
	The non-government Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) body has criticised the ministers statement saying it is tantamount to initiating a process that will remove the distinction between the industrialised countries and the developing countries.         
	The statement was not necessary. We have no obligation to accept any kind of legally-binding emission cuts and by accepting such cuts we are in the process of erasing distinction between developed and developing countries and put Kyoto Protocol in jeopardy, said Chandra Bhusan, deputy director of CSE and an observer in Cancun.

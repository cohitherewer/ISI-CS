	July 6: The South Eastern Railway has advanced by two hours the night curfew for trains running through the Maoist-affected Jungle Mahal in view of a two-day bandh.        
	Trains that pass through parts of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia will not run between 8pm and 5am on July 7 and 8. The restriction used to start at 10pm following the Jnaneswari Express sabotage.        
	The Steel Express and Howrah-Purulia Express have been cancelled during the bandh days. A special passenger train will run between Tatanagar and Kharagpur on the bandh days, leaving Tatanagar at 4.30pm.        
	PM to meet CMs: The Prime Minister is expected to hold consultations with chief ministers of Naxalite-affected states, including Bengal, on July 14 on posting army advisers in state capitals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Latas bag of Tirupati woes
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Latas bag of Tirupati woes
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                      Lata Mangeshkar                          
	Hyderabad, Jan. 31: At the Lords abode, but hardly on song.        
	Lata Mangeshkar first lost her handbag at a Tirupati programme graced by two governors and a chief minister last night. This morning, temple officials allegedly left the Bharat Ratna singer unattended in a car for three hours as she waited for her substitute air ticket the original was in the lost bag to be delivered.        
	The 81-year-old had put the bag  a Gucci said to be worth Rs 7,500 and also containing her medicines, credit cards and mobile  on a chair after she got up for the felicitation following the release of her CD of devotional songs dedicated to Lord Venkateshwara, the presiding deity.         
	The singer returned to her seat on the dais, where Andhra chief minister K. Rosaiah, state governor E.S.L. Narasimhan and his Madhya Pradesh counterpart Rameshwar Thakur were also present. A source said Lata looked for the bag only towards the end of the event.         
	Not finding it, Latas aides informed the special Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) officer attending to her. The singer was told, among others by TTD executive officer I.Y.R. Krishna Rao who is also said to have apologised, that key items like her ticket would be given to her soon.        
	But around 10.30 this morning, as the singer prepared to leave and got into her car at the temples VIP Padmavati Guesthouse, the special officer was nowhere to be seen. Anxious, she started making frantic calls to other temple officials for her ticket, but nothing happened. The elusive officer show- ed up around 1.30pm, by when the singer had already spent over three hours cooped up in the vehicle.        
	She refused to rest in the room (of the guesthouse) or have lunch as she was keen to catch the flight to Hyderabad where she was to receive a state government award, said an official in Rosaiahs office.         
	Other officials in the chief ministers office expressed shock at the singers predicament and announced an inquiry.

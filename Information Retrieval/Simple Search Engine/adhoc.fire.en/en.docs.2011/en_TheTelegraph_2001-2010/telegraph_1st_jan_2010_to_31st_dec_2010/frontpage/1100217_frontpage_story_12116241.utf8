The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hear the top cops excuse: Attack was not expected
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Hear the top cops excuse: Attack was not expected
  - If people cant help us, well shift: DG        PRONAB MONDAL                                           
	Shilda (West Midnapore), Feb. 16: Bengal police did not expect the Maoist attack that killed 24 policemen and a college student on Monday, the director-general of the force said today, brandishing a line of defence rarely associated with a field mission.        
	It was not expected that such an attack would take place in a built-up area like Shilda, Bengal police chief Bhupinder Singh said after an inspection of the burnt-down camp of the Eastern Frontier Rifles here.        
	With the choice of location of the camp  cheek by jowl with a bustling market  itself coming under attack, Singh said it had been set up to provide security to the local people.        
	The director-general went on to say that the camp would be dismantled, if people cannot help us and warn us about the Maoists, which raises the question whether the police are setting a condition on those they originally wanted to protect.        
	 Right now we are dismantling this camp, Singh said. Well look for another proper location with better defence capabilities. This camp was set up in the heart of Shilda market to provide security to the local people. If they (locals) cannot help us and warn us about the suspicious movement of Maoists in this market, well have to shift the camp.        
	Some officers said the proposed closure was a typical case of bolting the stable doors after the horses have fled. The officers listed at least five fundamental lapses in the way the camp was set up and run (see graphic). Officials in the Union home ministry, too, listed identical errors.        
	The officers also questioned Singhs logic that the force was not expecting an attack since Shilda was a built-up area.        
	Thats a nave assumption, especially since Shilda is in the heart of Maoist territory and so close to the Jharkhand border, an officer said.         
	The troops must always be battle-ready with their firearms with them since an attack on such a camp can take place any time. The troops should be told to expect an attack at all times and be ready to combat it.        
	Besides, they said, senior officers should have inspected the camp and made sure that basic security measures were in place.        
	Why blame the jawans for being lax? What were the senior officers doing? asked an indignant officer. Routine inspections of such camps have to be carried out to ensure that such measures were in place. Somebody was not doing his job and there can be no excuse for this.        
	These officers were also shocked that only three sentries were on duty at the camp, one each at the two gates and one inside. The others were either relaxing or cooking, far away from their weapons.        
	It was only after the Maoists had exploded bombs and started shooting did the jawans rush to collect their arms.        
	Take the case of Amiya Tamang, a policeman who had gone out of the camp in civvies to have tea without his gun. I suddenly heard the sound of an explosion and then the gunfire, Tamang admitted today.         
	I was helpless without my gun and simply watched from a distance as my colleagues were killed by the Maoists. If I had been carrying my gun, I could have at least shot some of the Maoists.        
	Or the case of K.L. Pradhan, a jawan who is now in hospital with bullet injuries in both legs.        
	My gun was in my bed inside the tent while I was lounging around in another part of the camp, Pradhan said. When the firing started, I tried to rush back to my tent to get my gun. But it was too late. I knew I could not make it. So I scaled the wall and tried to flee but there were some Maoists outside who saw me and shot at me. I fell to the ground and pretended to be dead.        
	Officials said it was mandatory for police personnel in such camps to carry not only their guns but also extra ammunition.        
	Singh today admitted certain lapses, but also tried to defend the policemen. There might have been lapses to some extent, but the EFR personnel retaliated to some extent also, Singh said. There were also chances of collateral (civilian) damages. But well continue our operations against the Maoists.

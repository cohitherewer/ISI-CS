          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Ritish (top) and Muskaan                                 
	Chennai, Oct. 31: A parents worst nightmare has come true for Ranjith Kumar Jain and Sangeetha  the bodies of their 10-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son have been found floating in a canal in Coimbatore.        
	The kids, Muskaan and Ritish, were last seen on Friday while getting into a car driven by Mohan Raj. The 28-year-old youth had been the school pool car driver of the Marwari textile merchants children. He had quit two weeks ago.        
	On October 29, Mohan suddenly turned up to pick the kids up for school at 8.15am. Mohan told the kids grandmother, who had taken them to the pick-up spot, that he was substituting for the current driver who was ill.         
	But after Mohan left with the kids, the regular van driver called the Jains at 8.30 to inform that Muskaan and her seven-year-old brother were not there at their pick-up spot.         
	Mother Sangeetha called the school to find out if the kids had reached but Suguna Rip Matriculation School told her that Muskaan, in Class V, and Ritish, a Class II student, were not there.        
	Sangeetha then dialled the police.         
	By the time the police launched a hunt for Mohan, he had switched off his cellphone and had begun using a friends handset.         
	The driver was arrested in a farm near Coimbatore the same evening. He confessed that he had kidnapped Muskaan and Ritish and wanted to make ransom calls to their father. Mohan said he drove the two kids to Thirumurthy Hill, 50km from the textile town. He told them they were being taken to a school picnic.         
	Mohan said he took Ranjiths cellphone number from Ritish but was too scared to make the phone call. When the kids were washing their hands in a canal, having finished their tiffin, Mohan pushed them into the water.        
	Minutes before, Ritish, unaware that he had been abducted, had asked Mohan if he would like to share the lunch, the driver told the police.         
	Yesterday, Muskaans body was found in the canal. Today, the boys body was fished out.         
	The police has also arrested a tractor driver Manoharan, a friend of Mohan, on the charge of molesting Muskaan. As the post-mortem has showed Muskaan had been sexually assaulted, we quizzed Mohan. He said he and his friend sexually assaulted her before pushing her into the canal, an officer said.         
	Coimbatore is home to many Marwaris who are textile and jewellery businessmen. Ranjith, 38, and Sangeetha, 28, who came to Tamil Nadu from Jodhpur, often told friends that Coimbatore was their first home.

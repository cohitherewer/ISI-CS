The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Patel offers to quit, PM refuses to accept
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Patel offers to quit, PM refuses to accept
          OUR BUREAU                             Patel on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 22: Praful Patel today offered to resign taking moral responsibility for the air crash, breaking a chain of ministers from Congress allies dismissing flak after accidents or alleged wrongdoing under their watch.        
	The civil aviation minister returned to Delhi from the crash site to brief the Prime Minister and offered to quit. Sources said Manmohan Singh asked him to continue.         
	As head of the civil aviation family, I feel morally responsible that such a sad and tragic accident has taken place, Patel said after the meeting. The PM told me there are circumstances which, despite our best efforts, are not under our control but are in natures hands. We should now try to rectify whatever went wrong.        
	The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) refused comment.        
	Patel, who is from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), had earlier taken flak from the PMO for his handling of the Air India strike.         
	Mamata Banerjee and the DMK have aggressively battled charges against them and their departments.         
	The railways are allegedly suffering because of minister Mamatas preoccupation with Bengal politics. Her absence from Parliament when Mumbai came to a standstill because of a strike by motormen, and failure to even visit New Delhi station after a stampede last Sunday attracted criticism from the Opposition.         
	Telecom minister and DMK leader A. Raja faces allegations of having connived with lobbyists to avoid a transparent 2G spectrum auction.         
	Patels party chief, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar had faced flak for rising food prices.         
	Although the Congress never directly attacked any of its allies, the allegations helped tilt the alliance balance in its favour, NCP sources argued.         
	Our relationship with the Congress is filled with tension. The Congress always keeps as a weapon anything that can help it tighten screws on us, a senior party leader said.         
	By acting against then junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoor, the Congress also marked out what it could claim was its difference from its allies.         
	Patels move has helped prevent the balance tilting further in the Congresss favour, the NCP leader said.

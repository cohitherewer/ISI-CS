          NASIR JAFFRY                      A billboard in Karachi with Kareena Kapoor rsquo;s picture                          
	Islamabad, March 20: Once Pakistanis chanted at cricket stadiums: Madhuri do, Kashmir lo (India, give us Madhuri Dixit and take Kashmir).        
	Kareena Kapoor, though, has had the country divided.         
	Karachi billboards showing the current Bollywood actress have triggered a mixed reaction from Pakistani bloggers. Firdous Cloth Mills billboards are using Kareenas pictures to advertise a recently launched line of summer suits.        
	If Pakistani companies are hiring Indian models, its good for peace between the two countries  so have a big heart and develop a habit to accept good changes, wrote Saira Hamza on the Fashion Iconz blog.        
	Many other comments on the blogsite, however, opposed the display of Indian film stars on Pakistani billboards.        
	Pakistani models are far better than Indian models why should we display Indians??? wrote Sarah. This Indian fever is so really childish. We should support our own talent.        
	Fashion Iconz said Firdous had also approached several other Indian actresses, such as Dia Mirza and Ria Sen, to exhibit its summer collection for 2010.        
	Aamir Khan, a Karachi resident, welcomed Firdouss move. My wife was quite amazed to see Kareena Kapoor on the billboard, and so was I, he said.        
	My wife wants to buy one or two lawn prints of this company after seeing the advertisement.        
	I think this is a good change to display Indian actresses. It really looks refreshing, said Umair Ali, a Class XII student of a college in Karachi.        
	For some reason, Firdous Mills website was unavailable on the Internet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Shilda strike signals wider onslaught
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Shilda strike signals wider onslaught
  - Hobbled by setbacks, Maoists still lethal           SUJAN DUTTA                                                    
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: The Shilda massacre by a Maoist guerrilla squad signals the beginning of a countrywide counter-offensive by the militants, senior sources in the security establishment believe.        
	In the jargon of the CPI (Maoist), actions such as the one in Shilda are part of the tactical counter-offensive campaign (TCOC) that the banned outfit notifies for its cadre from time to time to disperse security forces.        
	Central and state security forces are now concentrated in the Chhattisgarh-Orissa-Maharashtra-Andhra Pradesh and the Jharkhand-Orissa border zones.        
	Shilda also demonstrates that the CPI (Maoist) has de-centralised its organisation well enough to carry out operations despite the central and state polices successes in tracking and arresting or neutralising a substantial number of its leaders.        
	Police forces in and around Lalgarh have no option but to turn their camps into fortified settlements that have to be converted into operational bases, the sources say, quoting from experience in northern Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.        
	Perimeter security is the operative word for police officers in charge in these areas. Shilda is a lesson in how not to behave, said one officer.        
	Commando instructor Brigadier Ponwar, who runs the Counter Terrorism and Jungle Warfare in Kanker, Chhattisgarh, put it bluntly: There will inevitably be demands from the state (Bengal) for more forces but what is the point in sending a hundred more goats to the slaughter? Unless the police are trained, they will get nowhere and we cannot blame them for this. Pot-bellied policemen who can barely walk 400m with a gun cannot be expected to match the guerrillas who can walk 40km through the jungle at night.        
	The Union home ministry team with military adviser Brigadier D.S. Dadwal that visited Shilda on Wednesday went to study just this aspect and prepare recommendations, not only for Bengal but also for other states.        
	Attached to the Union home ministry in early 2009, Dadwal, an infantry officer, is responsible for co-ordinating training in counter-insurgency and jungle warfare for central and state police forces, operational planning and use of technology in the offensive against the Maoists.        
	In the months ahead, it is likely that Bengal police and the central forces in the state will focus on moving camps to more secure locations, building bunkers and watchtowers, erecting zig-zag defences near gates and procuring and installing early warning systems.        
	This would mean that nearly a third of the forces will have to be relieved from the primary task of gathering intelligence and patrolling and be devoted to securing the police camps. But that is just how forces occupying territories where the governments writ does not run have to act.        
	The Maoist counter-offensive comes as P. Chidambarams home ministry has lowered the profile of the security forces advance in the Chhattisgarh-Andhra belt after warning of the operations through much of last year.        
	For the moment, the advance has been kept out of the gaze of the urban public and the brigade disparagingly known in the administration as the human rights-wallahs with little or no access to the position on the ground.        
	But a senior official in Chhattisgarh involved in the action said: We have been making steady progress, we are not just blasting our way through, it is a gradual, creeping re-occupation of territory. The official claimed that security forces were now setting up camps after crossing the Indravati river that demarcates part of the borders that Chhattisgarh shares with Orissa and Maharashtra.        
	If such a claim is true, it is the first time that security forces have entered the 4,000 sqkm region known as Maad that the administration has long suspected to be the base of the CPI (Maoist) leadership. It is also home to some of the poorest people, particularly the Maria tribals, in the subcontinent.        
	The Maoists last TCOC was in the months that led to the general election in May-June last year when, too, state and central paramilitary forces were deployed in vast areas. Between April 6 and June 12, 2009, 112 policemen were killed. It was acknowledged in a June 12 document of the party and in other documents later.        
	Lalgarh Maoist leader Kishens claim that the Shilda attack was part of their Operation Peace Hunt  in response to the Centres Operation Green Hunt  has led senior security officials and analysts here to believe that more attacks on the scal e just seen in West Midnapore are likely to follow.        
	The Centre says that there is no Operation Green Hunt. Green Hunt is the name coded for the area domination exercise by state and central forces in southern Chhattisgarh.        
	Officials in the administration complain that helicopters of the Indian Air Force are not being efficiently used.        
	One air force officer said: We are often asked to ferry VIPs in Chhattisgarh when we should actually be transporting troops or carrying out surveillance even if we are not using our firepower. He advocated the use of airpower before the Maoists acquired the capability to target helicopters. In November, the air force was told it had the right to fire in self-defence.

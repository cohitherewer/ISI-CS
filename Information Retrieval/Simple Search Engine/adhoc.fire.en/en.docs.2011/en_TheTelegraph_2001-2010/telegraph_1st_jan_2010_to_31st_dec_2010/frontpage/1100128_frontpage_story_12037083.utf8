  - Cong frowns on Chatwal award, Centre issues statement          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Chatwal                                
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: The Centre today took the extraordinary step of formally defending its decision to award the Padma Bhushan to US-based hotelier Sant Singh Chatwal as Congress leaders scrambled to say the party didnt approve of the avoidable choice.        
	Padma Bhushan is one of the highest civilian honours of our country. It should be given to people who enhance the prestige of the award, not to those who use it to enhance their own prestige, party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said.        
	The comment came as the home ministry stepped in to clear the air with a statement that said due diligence had been done before announcing the name of Chatwal, who once faced several cases of alleged fraud. As per available reports, there is nothing adverse on record against Shri Chatwal, said the ministrys statement, which hailed him as a tireless advocate of Indias interests in the US.        
	Congress leaders pointed a finger at a senior official in the Prime Ministers Office (PMO). They said his lobbying had compelled a reluctant home ministry to clear Chatwals name for the honour.        
	The PMO is represented in the awards committee, which selects the nominees. This apolitical committee, constituted every year by the Prime Minister, usually includes bureaucrats, like the home secretary and the defence secretary, and eminent personalities from the civil society.        
	Recommendations are invited from state governments/Union territory administrations, central ministries, institutions of excellence and even private bodies. The final list prepared by the committee is sent to the Prime Minister for approval before the Republic Day-eve announcements.        
	Sources said there had been controversies over the choice of nominees in the past as well but the government had never issued a formal statement to defend itself.        
	The statement released today by the home ministry said the CBI had registered between 1992 and 1994 five cases against Chatwal and some bank officials for conniving with the intention to defraud the Bank of Baroda and Bank of India.         
	Three of these cases were closed by the CBI itself while chargesheets were filed by the CBI in two cases before the court of special judge, the CBI, Mumbai. In these two cases also, the court discharged Shri Chatwal, the statement said.        
	The statement hailed Chatwal, who counts Hillary Clinton among his friends, as someone who had been working relentlessly for strengthening bilateral relationships.         
	It said Chatwal was a trustee of the William J. Clinton Foundation, which focuses on critical global issues such as health care (and) climate change,        
	The statement said Chatwal was an active member of NRI community in the US in securing support for the nuclear deal among the members of US Congress. But sources familiar with the developments in the US then said his role might have been overstated.        
	No Padma award is conferred except on the recommendation of the awards committee constituted for the purpose and after the due diligence has been done, the statement said.        
	To blunt the ruling partys criticism, the home ministry statement pointed out that Chatwal had also received the Rajiv Gandhi Award in 2005.        
	Congress leaders laughed away the comparison. They said this award was instituted by Mumbai Congress vice-president Charan Singh Sapra, who every year honours achievers in different fields, such as trade, education, sports and film. One of the recipients, they said, was film actor Suneil Shetty.        
	Congress spokesperson Ahmed said the general principle in awarding Padma honours, unveiled on every Republic Day-eve, was that the choice should be free of taint.        
	It is unlikely that a party spokesperson would have been so explicit in his criticism of a government decision had there not been unambiguous directives from his bosses.        
	Congress insiders said party chief Sonia Gandhi had not approved of the choice of Chatwal, though he was close to the corridors of power in both India and America.        
	A powerful lobby of politicians and bureaucrats in Punjab is also said to have lobbied for the inclusion of Chatwals name in the honour rolls.        
	Senior Congress sources admitted that several ministers and bureaucrats in the present set-up had close links with Chatwal, but made it clear that the central leadership had not made any recommendations.        
	Even the home ministrys clarification raised eyebrows, with party insiders saying it was ridiculous that the government had to defend itself. The clarification is ridiculous. It only draws attention to Chatwals past. The government should introspect if there were better choices available, an All India Congress Committee office-bearer said.        
	The statement came even as the opposition BJP slammed the government for rewarding a broker.

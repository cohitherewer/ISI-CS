  - Board proposes high rate of 9.5%        JAYATI GHOSE AND SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                                                    
	Sept. 15: The employees provident fund trustees have recommended an annual interest rate of 9.5 per cent, dipping into a serendipitous surplus to signal the first full percentage point increase in five years.        
	If the finance ministry clears the festival gift, over 4.7 crore employees in the public as well as private sectors will stand to benefit. Their retirement savings now earn interest at the rate of 8.5 per cent a year.        
	The proposed rate will ensure that the EPF becomes the most lucrative savings instrument. The highest interest earner so far is the senior citizens savings scheme at 9 per cent. Small savings schemes offer 8 per cent and bank deposits up to 7.5 per cent.        
	The one percentage point increase proposed by the Central Board of Trustees of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) means that every Rs 1 lakh in the savings will earn an additional Rs 1,000 this year as interest.        
	The EPF rate was maintained at 8.5 per cent since 2005-06, largely because of divisions over how and where to invest the saved funds.        
	The government had proposed that part of the money  the fund has built up a corpus of Rs 3,48,800 crore, equivalent to 6.26 per cent of the countrys gross domestic product  be invested in the stock market for better returns.         
	But trade unions, which are represented on the board of trustees along with employers and the government, are arrayed against the proposal. Today, too, the board took no decision on parking funds in the stock market.        
	The plan to hike the rate  which will be seen as a populist measure ahead of Assembly elections in several states such as Bihar and Bengal  came through largely because of a surplus of Rs 1,731 crore thrown up by an audit of the Augean stables of the fund.        
	Since bookkeeping measures are being credited for finding the surplus, it remains to be seen if the fund can sustain the interest rate next year also. Some analysts expect that rate to be brought back to 8.5 per cent next year.        
	Industry chamber Assocham said the high rate of interest would not be sustainable by the EPFO on the basis of the investment pattern decided by the government. It is doubtful that this high rate of interest could be sustained, the industry body said.        
	Ficci said the hike could put pressure on interest rates of competing saving instruments.        
	Before April 2005, the retirement fund manager had given an interest rate of 9.5 per cent for three consecutive financial years.        
	As part of the clean-up operation, the board of trustees has decided that provident funds not operated for more than three years would not get any interest. There are over 3 crore dead accounts, in which over Rs 15,000 crore is parked, D.L. Sachdeva, the AITUC secretary, said.        
	The 9.5 per cent interest rate will result in a deficit of about Rs 1,600 crore over the EPFOs estimated earnings in 2010-11, said Samirendra Chatterjee, the central provident fund commissioner.         
	We have located a surplus savings of Rs 1,731 crore in our interest suspense account by undertaking a reconciliation of our accounts and balance sheet since inception in 1952. This surplus will take care of the shortfall, the commissioner added.         
	For over 4 crore subscribers, this is a big gift from EPFO trustees, labour minister Mallikarjun Kharge said.

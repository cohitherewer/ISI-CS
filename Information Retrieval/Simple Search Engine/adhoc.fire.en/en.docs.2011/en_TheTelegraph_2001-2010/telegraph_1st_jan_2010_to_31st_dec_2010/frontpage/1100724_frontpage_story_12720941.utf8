                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                DGPs phone bill: Rs 1000 and repentance 
  - In the dock over mobile, police chief grilled but no blemish on service record           A STAFF REPORTER                                                
	Calcutta, July 23: Head bowed most of the time, Bengal director-general of police Bhupinder Singh today stood in a makeshift dock in the Assembly and unconditionally apologised for setting off his camera phone flash by mistake.        
	Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim directed him to donate Rs 1,000 to the chief ministers relief fund as punishment. Singh had been in the House yesterday as Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was presenting the police budget.        
	Singh, summoned to the House to explain his conduct, got back his Nokia E Series phone after he produced a payment receipt. It was confiscated yesterday after the flash popped and drew the ire of Congress MLAs protesting in the well of the Assembly.        
	Clad in a grey shirt and bottle-green trousers, Singh today walked in at 11.02am, escorted by marshal Debabrata Mukherjee, and stood in the dock set up in the well. The Assembly was almost packed with Congress, Trinamul and Left MLAs at that time.        
	Then the Speaker asked him if he had taken any pictures inside the House yesterday. He replied softly that the flash had popped by mistake, but since there was no microphone in front of the DG, Halim could not hear him.        
	I dont want your explanation. Tell me yes or no, the Speaker said.        
	Then Halim asked the marshal to listen to Singhs reply and relay it to him over the microphone on the desk of Manas Bhuniya, the Congress legislature party leader.         
	Red-faced, Singh replied through the marshal that he had not taken any photograph yesterday.                          
	The Speaker then asked: When I called you to my chamber yesterday, you said you received an SMS from Darjeeling and when you tried to see it, you took a photo by mistake. It was not intentional. But today you are saying that you did not take a photo, but the flash on your mobile phone went off. Why the contradiction?        
	Singh: A photo may have been taken accidentally.        
	Speaker: Do you regret yesterdays incident?        
	Singh: Yes, sir. I regret it and apologise unconditionally.        
	The Speaker then ruled: Since the DG has admitted his mistake and apologised unconditionally, his mobile phone stands forfeited by the House. To get back the mobile set, the delinquent must donate Rs 1000 to the chief ministers relief fund.        
	But Halim reassured Singh, who retires on August 31, that this will not affect your service career, promotion or pension.        
	The Speaker then allowed Singh to leave the House escorted by the marshal. After that, Halim said no one would be allowed inside the House with a mobile phone and adjourned the Assembly till 1.30pm.        
	Later, in his chamber, the Speaker clarified to newspersons that he had neither reprimanded nor fined the DG.        
	In my ruling, I have not used the word fine. I also have not reprimanded him. As the DG has realised his mistake and apologised, and now that he has to donate a sum of money to the chief ministers relief fund, that is his punishment, Halim said.        
	The Opposition was, however, not satisfied. Bhuniya said: After yesterdays incident, the government should have dismissed the DG. I am writing to the Union home minister and Prime Minister to inform them what the chief of the Bengal police has done.        
	Bhuniya said the question of moving a privilege motion against the DG did not arise as the Speaker had himself initiated the move to seek an explanation. The Speaker is the custodian of the House. When he makes a move first, privilege motions submitted by others will not be accepted, especially now that the case has been disposed of.        
	Partha Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition, said: Singhs act is despicable and he should have been suspended. But the Speaker exceeded his jurisdiction by ruling that this incident will not affect his professional career. This is absolutely blatant favouritism.

	Bodam, Feb. 13: Sleep is luxury for Suchan Singh. The 20-something man and his 50-odd comrades have a battle to fight  and win  for the sake of their families.         
	On a cold December day, chased by the formidable shadow of gun-toting Maoists and their wanton disregard for human life, these tribal youths and their family members had shifted to temporary shelters in Chamta from their native Koira village in Bodam block of East Singhbhum.         
	They forfeited their livelihood, primarily farming, in search of security  Chamta houses a CRPF camp  a sacrifice made in vain. While huddling around a paramilitary camp hasnt helped them conquer fear, it has only accentuated their miseries with rebels targeting the forces  and, as a consequence, them  more frequently.         
	But they are not giving up yet. Armed with traditional weapons, they keep vigil on rooftops and roads, ready to retaliate at the slightest indication of a rebel swoop.         
	There is a hint of irony in their kismet though.         
	Almost a decade ago, these very people had made Koira, 65km from Jamshedpur, a safe haven for Maoists, beguiled by promises of double-digit well-being. Chamta, Somadih, Gumandih and at least 10 other villages had followed suit, making the whole of Bodam inaccessible for anti-insurgency forces. Little did they know that welfare never flows through the barrel of a gun. Mentors soon became hunters and sympathisers were reduced to fugitives.         
	According to Judhistir Singh Sardar of Somadih, two rebels from Bengals West Midnapore district came to Bodam, then under Patamda block, in 2001-02. They deplored administrative apathy, promised financial benefits and garnered support for the CPI(Maoist).         
	A village leader, Mahavir Singh Sardar, and his seditious activity grew under their able tutelage. Mahavir was rewarded with area command.         
	In 2005, he was arrested for extortion and murder attempt on a contractor. He named Bholanath Singh, also a native, as his successor. The latter terrorised contractors and traders into paying him levy and was made area commander of a Maoist squad in Dalma (10km from Bodam), Judhistir said.         
	Bholanath was riding a wave of popularity in 2008  rewarding the local unemployed with token cash for running harmless errands for him  when the Maoist high command sent Arup Mochi from Belpahari, West Midnapore, to lead the Dalma squad.         
	Differences with Mochi pushed Bholanath into a years sabbatical.         
	In September 2009, he was branded police informer and killed. His murder was third in a row. Earlier, Mochis men slaughtered two local vegetable growers, Suphol Singh Bhumij and Meghlal Tuddu, also accusing them of being informers.         
	As if it were not enough, the rebels began plundering village homes. The choicest booty was minor girls. At least five, aged between 15 and 18, were abducted after Mochi took over the reins of the Dalma squad. No one ever saw them again. It is believed they are now active members of the squad.                                       
	The murder of Bholanath followed by a slew of such atrocities jolted the nave tribals out of a deep slumber.         
	What we thought was godsend was in reality the devils designs. There was a time when we fed them, but now it is time to fight them, fumed Suchan, stretching the string of his bow, which he knows is no match for automatic and semi-automatic weapons used by rebels. And yet, he and his friends have taken up the onus of guarding their families, staying awake for nights together.         
	The tribal youths who were once dead against security pickets now seek shelter near them. The first batch of CRPF had reached Chamta in November. Deputy commandant of the 193rd Battalion Sandeep Kumar Nandas assurances of safety raised hopes.                           
	Villagers, led by one Jalan Mardi, held their first anti-rebel meeting on November 24. quot;There have been 15 meetings since, quot; Judhistir said, refusing details, but indicating an uprising.         
	Laxman Singh Sardar, a villager, revealed that the Chamta Middle School, where CRPF men are currently camping, was once a Maoist arsenal. quot;It is 4km from Purulia, a hotbed of Naxalite activity in Bengal, and there were no security posts within a 15km radius. Chamta became a transit point, quot; Sardar, who now aids anti-insurgency operations in the area, said.         
	He conceded that killing Bholanath and forcing girls to join the outfit were the two blunders the Maoists committed. quot;Else their mask of messiah would have remained intact. quot;         
	Manoranjan Mahto of Somadih whose relative was among the five abducted girls said: quot;We live in fear. Many neighbours have already sent their women away to distant places. quot;        
	 Dasrath Bhumij sounded intrepid: quot;The rebels are notorious for exploiting girls. We are on our guard. We wont tolerate such tyranny anymore. quot;         
	Scared or spirited, they unanimously agree on one thing  this is the price they have to pay for abetting Naxalism.

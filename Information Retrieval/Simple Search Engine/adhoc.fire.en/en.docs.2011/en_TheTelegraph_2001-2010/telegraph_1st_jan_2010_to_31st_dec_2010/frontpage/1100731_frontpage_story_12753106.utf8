          OUR BUREAU                               
	Ranchi, July 30: In a move fraught with political intrigue, the governors advisory council today scrapped special privileges being enjoyed by former chief ministers of the state, giving Babulal Marandi, Arjun Munda, Shibu Soren and Madhu Koda three months time to give up their sprawling bungalows in Ranchi.        
	While Marandi, who has already declared he would be giving up his Ranchi residence ever since the issue was raised by a Congress MP early this month, however, questioned the constitutional propriety of a governor overruling a decision taken by an elected state government.        
	During his tenure as chief minister in 2003, Arjun Munda decided to accord to all former chief ministers certain privileges that included a rent-free house, private secretary, chauffeur-driven car and a telephone.        
	In 2006-07, around Rs 10.3 lakh was spent on former chief ministers. In 2008-09 it was Rs 16.89 lakh. In the current fiscal, the budget has zoomed to Rs 29.39 lakh.        
	The governors council has, however, added some riders to the three-months time limit it has given to the former chief ministers.         
	A formal notification is expected in a day or two. They would be allowed free stay in their existing bungalows for only another month. For the next two months, they will have to pay a rent, which is yet to be decided. After three months, they will have to move out.        
	Their security would be reviewed with the police special branch told to work out detailed reports on individual threat perceptions. They can keep their telephones for three months, but the monthly bill cannot exceed Rs 3,000.         
	Their private secretary and orderly would be withdrawn after three months.         
	After he resigned as chief minister, Marandi had moved into the state guest house near Ranchi College. Thereafter, it was officially converted into his official residence in Ranchi.         
	Arjun Munda is now occupying a spacious bungalow on Circular Road, which used to be the circuit house. Shibu Soren continues to occupy the same house near Morabadi grounds he was allotted when he was chief of Jharkhand Autonomous Area Council in the mid-90s.         
	As for Koda, he has been given the Deendayal Nagar house he was allotted when he was a minister in the Marandi government.        
	Todays decision by the governors council comes after Congress MP and National Development Council member Ram Dayal Munda and party MLAs Geetashree Oraon and Sawna Lakra met Governor M..H. Farook to demand scrapping of the privileges.        
	Marandi, who promptly declared he would give up his house once the issue was made public, was nevertheless suspicious of the move which he felt was being pursued at the behest of a few senior Congress leaders in Delhi to browbeat a junior ally.        
	I have already shot off a letter to the governor making it clear that I was ready to return the privileges granted by the state, Marandi said today, but did not hide his displeasure at a governor reversing a decision taken by an elected government.        
	Munda seemed elated with the decision. The governor, being the custodian of the Constitution, has set things right. It will send a good message to politicians, officials and the people to behave responsibly, he told The Telegraph.        
	A senior bureaucrat said it all. The move will ensure political stability in the state as nobody would like to be chief minister for a day and be a parasite on the state coffers for his/her entire life, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Steel hub misses the bus

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jamshedpur, Aug. 19: The eagerly awaited city bus service seems to have hit a roadblock in Jamshedpur because of an inept local civic administration that hasnt been able to resolve infrastructural bottlenecks concerning a parking bay for the 50 buses that are to run under a JNNURM project.        
	Initially planned for a launch yesterday, it now looks like the steel city will have to wait at least for another fortnight for the service that is already running successfully in the state capital and Dhanbad.        
	Necessary infrastructure is required to be created for parking and maintenance of the buses. The local civic body, which is supposed to keep tabs on the operation, has been told to expedite work so that we can launch the service early next month, said Alok Prasad, manager (administration) of Jharkhand Tourism Development Corporation (JTDC).        
	Officials of the local civic body, Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC), ducked for cover by linking the launch delay to Governor M..H. Farooks apparent inability to spare time to come to Jamshedpur.        
	The governors programme was postponed due to which the bus service could not begin yesterday. We are awaiting a fresh date from Raj Bhavan, said J.P. Yadav, special officer of JNAC.         
	However, later Yadav grudgingly admitted that non-registration of buses and delay in identifying a parking lot were also responsible for pushing back the launch.        
	While Jamshedpur is to get 50 buses, Ranchi and Dhanbad have been allotted 100 buses each. The city bus service was launched in Ranchi on June 26 with 50 buses running on five routes, while the service started in Dhanbad on August 9 with 48 buses.        
	A JTDC official said buses for Jamshedpur would arrive here from Ranchi only after Raj Bhavan confirmed a launch date.         
	We have identified a place in Sidhgora where the buses will be parked, he said, adding the buses would run on eight routes in Jamshedpur with fares ranging between Rs 4 and Rs 10.         
	Prasad said Ranchi-based Bhutpurv Sainik Kalyan Sangh, a group of retired servicemen, would provide drivers and helpers to run the buses. The sangh has quoted a daily charge of Rs 500 per bus for Jamshedpur.         
	Presently, Jamshedpur boasts 40-odd buses run by private operators on fixed routes in addition to the usual vans and auto-rickshaws. It is the only city in Jharkhand to have a private bus service.

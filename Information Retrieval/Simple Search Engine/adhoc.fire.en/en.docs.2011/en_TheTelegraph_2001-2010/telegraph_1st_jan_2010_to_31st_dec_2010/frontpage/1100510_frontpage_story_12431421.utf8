                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Born with silver spoon, life with nawabi dagger
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                            Faisal Nawab and the ancestral knife                                  
	Hyderabad, May 9: He was the Don with the trademark Dagger, the ornate nawabi knife worn at the hip a reminder of his royal ancestry. Typically, it was stolen property, pinched from one of the palaces of his father, the last Nizam.        
	Faisal Ali alias Faisal Nawab, son of Mukkaram Jah and one of his concubines, was captured from an auto-rickshaw with two gang members yesterday allegedly after a decade-and-a-half-long career as mafia leader.        
	When he was picked up near Hyderabad, the sheathed, curved steel dagger with a bronze handle was as usual stuck under his belt, police sources said.        
	The man in his 30s, who would as a boy steal small valuables from the Nizams Moti Mahal and Purani Haveli where he had easy access as a royal, is now wanted in over 40 cases of murder, robbery, extortion, land grab and drugs smuggling.        
	Faisal Nawab had been evading the police for years and, if convicted, will be jailed for five to ten years, a police source said.        
	Old-timers said the child Faisal loved garish clothes and costly accessories, which may explain the fascination with the dagger that he carried everywhere  probably for effect since its unclear if he had committed any crime with it.        
	Ordinarily, such nawabi knives would be decked out with jewels but this one had none, the police source said, hinting Faisal may have prised them out and sold them after stealing the weapon.        
	Faisals parents are said to have disowned him after he was caught making off with silver cutlery from the Faluknama Palace. The boy lived with his aunts and uncles  all relatives of the Nizam  in and around the palaces.        
	He took to serious crime after the Jah family trusts stopped paying dole to the numerous children of the Nizams mistresses, additional deputy commissioner M. Ravindernath Babu said.        
	Used to the high life but suddenly strapped for cash, many of them took to such vocations in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Bangalore, where they still had some family estates in their possession, the officer said.        
	Faisal allegedly collected thousands of rupees every day from his victims, mostly real estate agents. The police said they found ganja and other drugs on him, apparently being smuggled from Warangal to Mumbai via Hyderabad.        
	Officers said Faisal faced two murder cases and several cases of attempt to murder.        
	The Nizams family will be breathing easy after the arrest. Faisal was involved in a decade-old dispute with the Jahs over 24 acres of prime land in Banjara Hills. The plot belongs to Muffakam Jah, younger brother of the last Nizam.

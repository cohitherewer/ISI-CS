	Ranchi, Dec. 25: Thirty-five-year-old Munni Kumar paid with her life for insisting upon attending midnight mass yesterday, against her husbands wishes.        
	Satish Kumar (38), a laboratory assistant at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU), returned to his quarters on the BAU campus inebriated and started arguing with his wife when she said she was going to church for the midnight service. When he failed to talk her out of going, he attacked her with a stick and beat her till she collapsed. Kumar then went to sleep.        
	This morning, when he realised that his wife was dead, Kumar tried to cover up his crime by informing the BAU authorities that his sister-in-law had died and he needed an ambulance. Kumar was on the verge of ferrying away the body for burial when he was noticed by the woman with whom he was involved in an extra-marital relationship.         
	The woman alerted neighbours, who called the police. Soon Kumar was arrested.        
	Kanke officer-in-charge said Kumar wanted to dispose of the body secretly but was nabbed just in time.        
	Sources in BAU said his personal problems had been affecting Kumars work for some time and it had been brought to the notice of his superiors. They added that Kumar frequently assaulted his wife who objected to his drinking.

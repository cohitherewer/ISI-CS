          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Sept. 26: The most powerful woman of Bengal carries the memory of her power along with her so that even after she lost it, it was delivered at her doorstep an hour later.         
	The shop that powered her spectacles delivered them within an hour after she reported to her local aides on arriving at the Darjeeling circuit house that her glasses were missing, two hours before a meeting with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha at 4pm. Kwality Stores in Chowkbazar, the aides who prepared her itinerary said, did a good job since they delivered a new set of glasses to her within an hour.        
	It was possible because Didi knew the power that her lenses need, said one of the aides as he waved a bill for the glasses, suggesting that it was not a gift from the store, which probably did not know who would be the owner of the spectacles. But it was not clear who finally settled the bill.         
	Earlier, during her climb uphill, the railway minister stepped out of the car all of a sudden and put a khada on a 60-year-old woman trudging uphill with a bundle of grass. Some drew parallels with Rahul Gandhis style, but Mamata is no stranger to working crowds.         
	The railway minister had started from NJP around 10.40am with a cavalcade of 25 cars. Thousands stood along the Sukna-Rohini road, showering flowers and shouting Mamata Banerjee welcome and We want Gorkhaland slogans. The last such welcome was given to Darjeeling MP Jaswant Singh when he visited the hills to file the nominations in 2009.        
	Since then a lot of water has flowed down the Teesta and Singh had been suspended from his party and later taken back. But with the BJP out of power, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has realised that there is nothing more to be gained from the party.         
	Mamata sent the Intelligence Bureau personnel in charge of her security into a tizzy, when the car stopped 50 metres from the Kurseong railway station and she started walking towards the people accepting khadas, bouquets and memorandums. But soon, she was mobbed and she scurried back to the safety of her car.         
	At Elysia Building, the headquarters of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, Mamata refused to take any question from the media, but told the railway staff: Recruit brothers and sisters from both hills and plains.. and start functioning it in a full-fledged manner. To the waiting journalists, she said: We are here for tea and refreshments. Let me meet the people first.         
	On being told that she was among the few ministers to visit the hills, Mamata replied: Anyone can come here. She reached Darjeeling around 1.30pm.

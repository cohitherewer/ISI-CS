          NARESH JANA                            Mohammad Etaharul Islam, killed in the encounter                                  
	Jhargram, June 27: A security force constable and a Maoist were killed today in a four-and-a-half-hour shootout in a jungle about 14km from Jhargram town.        
	This is the first time a member of the security forces has been killed in a direct encounter with the rebels in Bengal.        
	Mohammad Etaharul Islam, 27, of the Specially Trained Armed Company (Straco), was hit by a bullet in the back above his waist and died on the way to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital.         
	The body of the Maoist, who was wearing a lungi and shirt and appeared to be in his twenties, had yet to be identified. A single-barrel gun was found near the body.        
	Shibshankar Mahato, a local leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, disputed the police claim about killing a Maoist, saying an innocent villager, Kamal Mahato, had died.         
	According to the police, a 200-strong force, comprising CRPF and Straco personnel, was marching towards Ghritakham village in the jungle around 3am today following information that a group of about 15 Maoists had taken shelter either in the village or in the neighbouring jungle.        
	Led by Jhargram superintendent Praveen Tripathi, the forces split into three groups and crept towards the village in darkness.        
	We formed a semi-circle and approached the forest from three sides. Etaharul was with the group at the centre, a police officer said.        
	As his team inched towards a paddy field 500 metres from the village, they saw three men standing.        
	As soon as the forces saw the men, Etaharul shouted kaun hai. Immediately, the rebels fired at us. Our men took position behind the low mud walls (aal), which separate one plot from another, and fired back. Etaharul had crossed the nearest mud wall and turned back to take cover behind one. As he did so, he was hit by a bullet in the back, said a police officer.        
	Under fire, the Maoists rushed towards the jungle and took cover behind bamboo groves and sal trees.        
	Police officers said they saw at least three rebels get hit by bullets as the Maoists ran towards the jungle.        
	The security forces have seen bloodstains in some parts of the forest. It appears that the Maoists were dragged in different directions. They (the forces) followed a trail of blood and recovered the body of a Maoist, said Anil Kumar, DIG, Midnapore range.

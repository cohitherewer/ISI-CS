	New Delhi, June 22: The Union home ministry will decide on the appointment of officers for the counter-Naxalite offensive that the Indian Army has offered and the Indian Air Forces pullout of helicopters from UN missions will be a phased withdrawal, government sources said here today.        
	The Telegraph had reported on Tuesday that India wants to pull out its air force helicopters from UN missions in Africa and that the army was proposing to depute colonels to Naxalite-hit states.        
	India is staking its international reputation as a peacekeeper by seeking to pull out its air force helicopters from UN missions in Congo and Sudan because it needs to keep the peace in Naxalite-hit regions within the country.        
	Confirming that the defence ministry had urged the external affairs ministry to ask the UN department of peace keeping operations for the air force helicopters to be relieved, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said today: The ministry of defence has raised this issue with us and we have raised it with our permanent mission in New York. We are considering a phased withdrawal.        
	Army headquarters sources said here that its proposal to depute colonels to help states in their offensive against Naxalites has been made to the home ministry at its request. It would be up to the home ministry in with the state governments to decide where and how to use the expertise that the army was offering through its colonels.        
	We have offered to depute colonel-rank officers with experience of commanding battalions in counter-insurgency operations to provide advice in anti-Naxalite operations, the army source said. A brigadier is currently posted to the home ministry as the military adviser.        
	Depending on how the counter-Naxalite operations shape up, the army may also send more brigadiers to the home ministry.         
	The home ministry had earlier asked for major generals as advisers.        
	But it is the IAFs insistence that its helicopters on UN duty be withdrawn that has greater strategic implications for India.         
	India cites its traditional and large contributions to UN peace missions since the 1950s as one of the reasons to justify its claim for a permanent seat in the security council.         
	It also leaves the UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations (UNDPKO) in a tight situation because India was the only country that agreed to deploy its air force in Congo and Sudan.        
	Army sources said the number of officers that it was ready to depute to the Union home ministry for the states is yet to be decided. It has sent its proposal through the defence ministry.         
	The request to army for its expertise in counter-insurgency was made after Naxalite-hit states inquired repeatedly about military assistance.        
	Last weeks cabinet committee on security meeting on the strategy to rework the counter-Naxalite operations was inconclusive. But the security establishment is moving to calibrate the direct involvement of the military.        
	The home ministry is looking for an enhanced role of armed forces in anti-Naxalite operations.         
	The defence ministry is hesitant to get involved in it although it is not averse to providing some kind of logistical support.        
	IAF told the defence ministry that its 17 helicopters deployed in the UN missions in African countries may be called to meet the shortage of choppers in counter-Naxalite operations.

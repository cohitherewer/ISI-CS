The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Modiwood cut to size

  Two Bolly teams scrapped
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                        
	Mumbai, Oct. 10: The Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab were today thrown out of the IPL, weakening the tournaments Bollywood connection that had helped make it such a hit.        
	Other than scrapping the duos contracts, the IPL governing council set the Kochi franchise an October 21 deadline to sort out its internal quarrels and register itself as a company if it wanted to continue in the league.        
	Although the official reason for punishing the Royals and Kings was breach of franchise agreement, the unspoken reason was their indirect links with disgraced former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, whose BJP associations continue to dog him under Congress rule.        
	At todays meeting, a top Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official had opposed the Royals ouster but five influential council members put their foot down, said a source who was at the meeting.        
	They said that with the government agencies going full throttle in their probe against Modi, having Royals and Kings XI in the basket will mean further trouble for the BCCI, the IPL source said.        
	Both teams have denied the boards accusations and the Royals have said they intend to mount a legal challenge.        
	Todays decision means IPL 4 will not feature 10 teams as Modi had planned. As of now, there are seven teams.... If Kochi cleans up its act, it will make the eighth team. If not, well see, the source said.                    
	The decision also suggests that the leagues Modi-inspired days as an ultra-successful mix of instant cricket and celluloid glamour may be over. The Kings were co-owned by actress Preity Zinta and the Royals by the in-laws of actress Shilpa Shetty. Now the only team left that can boast a Bollywood owner is the Kolkata Knight Riders, whose stakeholders include Shah Rukh Khan.        
	Iconic Royals skipper Shane Warne, who led his underdog team to a memorable victory in IPL 1, tweeted: Hey Shilpa, please keep me posted if you hear anything, such sad news for us and our loyal fans, shattering to all!!!        
	Although the teams are contracted for 10 years, legal sources in the BCCI said the board was confident about winning any court case. They cited two reasons: one, the board had received money from the franchises only for the first three years and two, the ousted teams were overtly guilty of agreement breach and hazy ownership patterns. (See chart)        
	This newspaper had reported on July 4 that the Royals had admitted to the BCCI that though their bid was made by Emerging Media (IPL) Ltd, the agreement was signed by another company, Jaipur IPL Cricket Pvt Ltd.        
	Some TV reports, however, said the board had kept open the provision for compensating the axed teams with around $141 million.        
	Todays decision followed several failed backdoor attempts by the two franchises to stay on. On Friday, Manoj Badale (Royals owner and CEO) had met (BCCI president) Shashank Manohar at his Nagpur residence. We got the feeling that though we may face strictures, we wont be barred. Todays decision is a shocker, a top Royals source told The Telegraph.        
	Royals spokesman Raghu Iyer, though, said the franchise had not been in touch with the board in the past 15 days.        
	The IPL source said: As a compromise measure, some members had suggested to the Royals and the Kings that they throw out respective co-owners Suresh Chellaram and Gaurav Burman. The Royals said they needed more time but since they did not act, they got the axe.        
	Chellaram is Modis brother-in-law, and Dabur scion Gaurav Burman is Modis stepson-in-law. Chellaram and family own 44.2 per cent in the Royals while 34 per cent of Kings XI stake is held between Gaurav and his brother Mohit Burman, Dabur India director.        
	There are questions over Preitys 23 per cent Kings XI stake too. Kuki Investments, through which the family of Shilpas husband Raj Kundra holds 11.7 per cent stake in the Royals, is under the Enforcement Directorate (ED) scanner.         
	At todays meeting, the Punjab team had no backers. The Kings have failed to give details of their transactions even to the ED. The Royals at least supplied all the documents, the IPL source said.        
	A Kings XI statement dubbed the board decision unfair but hoped to resolve all misunderstandings.        
	Sources said the board did not issue show-cause notices to the Royals or Kings XI because legal opinion suggested this was not required and the teams could be scrapped straightaway. Kochi, though, is still likely to be issued a show-cause notice.        
	BCCI sources said that initially, many council members wanted to chuck out Kochi too but a former India captain and an ex-governing council member lobbied to buy it time.        
	Kochi had won the IPL bid with the blessings of then junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoor by forming a special purpose vehicle but hasnt yet incorporated itself into a registered company as stipulated by IPL laws.        
	The spat between the Kochi owners is over the 25 per cent sweat equity held by Rendezvous Sports, which has Tharoors wife Sunanda Pushkar as a stake owner.        
	The other four shareholders dont want Rendezvous to operate with 25 per cent sweat equity and want them to bring investments worth 25 per cent sweat equity. Sunanda had announced she would give up her stake after the controversy over her ownership cost Tharoor his job, but she continues to hold on to the stake, an IPL source said.        
	Tharoor, though, recently said Sunanda had returned all her shares. Tharoor had wanted to mediate the row, the IPL source said, but after the loss of his ministry, the other shareholders dont take him as seriously.

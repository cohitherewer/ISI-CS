	Ranchi/Koderma, May 12 (PTI): A candlelight procession was taken out last night in Koderma in support of late journalist Nirupama Pathak's incarcerated mother and to press for arrest of her boyfriend Priyabhanshu Ranjan in the case of her death.  
	While Nirupama's mother is languishing in jail, Priyabhanshu is roaming free. He should be immediately arrested, demanded the group, comprising people from Koderma.							   
	Lighting candles at Jhanda Chowk in the district town in support of Nirupama's mother and family members, Congress worker Nirmal Ojha and social worker Prabhakar Tiwari along with others sought to know why Priyabhanshu did not come to Koderma when Nirupama was alive.The electronic media from Delhi and Ranchi have stirred up all the hype, they alleged.   
	A few days back, Priyabhanshu's friends had staged a similar show in his support in Delhi and demanded justice for Nirupama.   22-year-old Nirupama was found dead on April 29 in her parents' house in Tilaya in Koderma district under mysterious circumstances.   
	The Koderma police had filed a FIR against Nirupama's mother Sudha Pathak, after which she was arrested and charged with her murder.  However, later after an appeal to a court by Nirupama's family, a FIR had been filed against Priyabhanshu charging him with rape and abatement to suicide.   
	Priyabhanshu's advocate Rajeev Kumar, who could not yesterday file a case seeking quashing of the FIR and demanding CBI probe into her death due to some technical flaws, is yet to file the petition.  Kumar yesterday said he would seek to restrain the police from taking any coercive action against Priyabhanshu and expressed surprise over how could the police investigate the matter on the basis of two contradictory FIRs.							   
	A team of Koderma police had already questioned Priyabhanshu and some common friends of the couple in New Delhi.

  - Dispur rules out district bifurcation        OUR BUREAU                                           
	Silchar/Nagaon, April 9: Dispur has ruled out the division of Dima Hasao as trouble returned to the volatile district with a pro-bifurcation group and the police engaging in a pitched battle that left 16 injured in the district headquarters of Haflong today.         
	Reacting to the demand of non-Dimasas for vivisection of the district as a fallout of the change in its nomenclature from North Cachar Hills to Dima Hasao last week, urban development minister and convenor of the cabinet sub-committee on the district Dinesh Prasad Goala told The Telegraph today that the government would stick to its decision.        
	The new name has words from the language of the Dimasas, the largest single population group in the multi-ethnic and multi-lingual hill district. However, the change has not been accepted by the non-Dimasas who fear that it would lead to Dimasa hegemony. They also contend that the Dimasas constitute 43 per cent of the total population.         
	Trouble broke out at Haflong this morning when security forces resorted to firing after being attacked by supporters enforcing a 24-hour bandh in the district in protest against its re-christening. The bandh was called by Indigenous Peoples Forum (IPF), a wide ranging platform of nine major tribal groups inhabiting the district, and the Indigenous Students Forum.         
	Among the injured were five police personnel, including superintendent of police B.K. Ramisetti, additional superintendent of police Amitava Sinha and Haflong police station officer-in-charge S. Swargiwari.         
	The police said more than 500 supporters of the two organisations had gathered in different parts of the town and were trying to enforce the bandh. They pelted stones and used the catapult to aim marbles at the security forces.         
	The police retaliated initially with a baton charge and then moved on to firing blanks before actually opening fire on the mobs that left five injured. Six others were injured in the lathicharge.         
	Referring to the new demand of the Indigenous Peoples Forum to bifurcate the 4,888 square km district into two autonomous districts for allowing the Dimasas and the non-Dimasas to live in peaceful proximity of each other, Goala said Dispur was aware of this new demand.        
	In a one-page representation to chief minister Tarun Gogoi, with a copy to Union home minister P. Chidambaram on Monday, the forum demanded that the subdivisions of Haflong and Maibong be upgraded into two districts under Articles 244(2) and 275(1) of the Constitution as a way out of the impasse created by renaming the district.        
	IPF general secretary Ngaidam Puruolte said in the new compromise settlement of the nomenclature issue, Haflong subdivision, where the bulk of non-Dimasa tribals are concentrated, will continue to be known as North Cachar Hills district. Maibong subdivision, the granary of the district in the north-eastern flank and a bastion of the Dimasa population, would be named Dima Hasao district.

  - Bilawal adds snap with UK PM to collection          AMIT ROY                      British Prime Minister David Cameron (right) at his country residence with Asif Ali Zardari and his son Bilawal. (AP)                                
	London, Aug. 7: Fresh from Christ Church, Oxford, with a second-class honours (upper division) in history, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari went at the weekend to Chequers, the British Prime Ministers country residence, and posed for a photograph with David Cameron.        
	Bilawal, 21, is getting quite a collection of these photographs. Last week in France, he posed with Nicolas Sarkozy, and last year in the US with President Barack Obama.        
	Bilawals late mother, Benazir Bhutto, in whose memory an olive tree was planted on the grounds of Chequers, would have been proud of her son. He looked handsome in immaculate white salwaar-kameez with a tiny Pakistani flag pinned to his broad chest.        
	Protocol on this delicate issue is unclear but Bilawal affected brown brogues with his Pakistani ensemble rather than more formal black.        
	It is certainly unusual for visiting political leaders to drag their children to formal talks but President Asif Ali Zardari probably calculated this was too good an opportunity to miss if Bilawal was going to fulfil his destiny of assuming the reins of power in Pakistan one day.        
	Some say it is Pakistans embattled President who needs to shore up his declining ratings with a photo opportunity emphasising that whatever else he is, he is the father of the assassinated leaders son.        
	For good measure, Zardari also took along his daughter, Asifa Bhutto Zardari, 16, who wore an elegant long blue coat with dark harem paints but significantly did not feel the need to don a hijab.        
	Zardaris enemies have accused of him of ignoring the 14 million flood victims back home so that he can groom his son for high office. This barb has sunk in for Bilawal, who was due to address a big rally of Pakistanis in Birmingham alongside his father. He has now pulled out of the engagement. Instead, he attended an appeal for help for the flood victims held at the Pakistani high commission in London.        
	Bilawal, who is co-chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party  his father is the other - has said he wants to pursue legal studies in London, so his tryst with destiny may have to wait another year.        
	There are suggestions that another of Bilawals sisters, Edinburgh University-educated Bakhtawar Bhutto Zardari, his junior by a year, may herself go into politics by taking up her mothers mission to serve the backward and downtrodden segments of the society and especially the women.        
	It is apparently her intention to promote democratic values and ensure inclusion of women in national development.        
	The last sibling rivalry in the family, between Benazir and her brother Murtaza, ended in tragedy. According to Murtazas daughter Fatima, who has written a book on her fathers death, he was gunned down at the behest of Benazir and her husband -- a charge Zardari denies.        
	Far from being ready to plunge into Pakistani politics, Bilawal is, according to one expert, bewildered by the gathering pressures on him. In any case, under Pakistani law, the children have to wait until they are 25 if they wish to stand in elections.        
	Bilawals involvement in politics at this stage is much more to do with his father  whose popularity at home has never been so poor  wanting to launder his own reputation through his son, than Bilawals own inclinations, Farzana Shaikh, author of Making Sense of Pakistan and associate fellow of the Asia programme at Chatham House, told a newspaper.        
	After talks with Cameron, Zardari expressed satisfaction at having made the British Prime Minister apparently see his point of view. Cameron has also promised to visit Pakistan. To a very great extent, the row between Britain and Pakistan has been defused but without Cameron retracting his statement (since most people on both sides recognise what he said was true).        
	In an interview with BBC2s Newsnight, Zardari was asked if he had challenged Cameron over his remarks in India. I think we engaged... on the positive, he said vaguely. We left the negative behind. So we engaged on the things that Pakistan has done and we talked about the future. I think there is a realisation in the world that Pakistan needs more support. We talked about the positives.        
	He denied that British terrorism had roots in Pakistan, insisting: I dont think British home-grown terrorism has roots, or any terrorism has roots, in Pakistan. Ive always maintained (that) terrorism passes through Pakistan; it doesnt evolve in Pakistan.

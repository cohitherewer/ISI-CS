The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Centre tiptoes on Qatar offer to Husain
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Centre tiptoes on Qatar offer to Husain
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Husain                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: The Centre and the capitals political establishment are cool to Qatars move to honour M.F. Husain as a national, with no formal statement on the possibility that the artist might have to give up Indian citizenship if he accepted the offer.        
	India does not allow dual citizenship though it has instituted a category called Overseas Indian Citizen.        
	Late in the evening, home secretary G.K. Pillai described Husain  who has been living in self-imposed exile in Dubai and London since 2006  as the pride of India and claimed the government was willing to give him security.        
	But Pillais comment came in response to a question posed by journalists who met him.        
	Husain was virtually hounded out of the country after a Hindi magazine published an inflammatory article on his paintings of Hindu deities in the nude.        
	Criminal cases were filed against him in remote places, the main charge being he had offended Hindus by his vulgar depiction of their gods and goddesses. Subsequent attempts to exhibit Husains paintings ended in attacks by Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad activists.        
	In Ahmedabad, a show had to be called off despite police deployment when the attackers pulled off the exhibits and damaged some.        
	Although it is believed that more than 900 cases are pending in different courts of the country against Husain, his lawyer Akhil Sibal says there are only three that are known. The three cases are being heard at Patiala House court in the capital. The Supreme Court quashed four cases against him in 2008.        
	In recent years, art exhibitors and galleries have refused to display Husains paintings despite assurances of security.        
	A senior Congress minister, who is also a connoisseur of art, put the onus on Husain. There is no security issue. He can return to the country when he wants but obviously he doesnt want to. He has sought a written assurance from the Centre that his life will not be harmed. How is that possible?        
	Congress Rajya Sabha MP Satyavrat Chaturvedi said if Husain needed more security, there is a process he will have to follow.         
	A young Congress leader admitted that the politics involved in the controversy was too hot to be handled by the party and the government. Lets face it, on religious issues, we cant take sides. At best, we can err on the side of caution and thats what we have done.        
	When pointed out that the Congress was willing to take a stand on the Shiv Senas offensive against Shah Rukh Khans My Name is Khan, a leader said: Ah well, SRK himself took a stand, we didnt need to on his behalf. The media were fully behind him, the chattering classes and what have you.        
	A young avant garde artist like Bose Krishnamachari partially concurred with the Congressman just quoted.        
	Krishnamachari admitted to feeling shamed by the turn of events but added that he would blame the Centre and Husain equally. If he is strong enough, he should come back. Look at Shah Rukh, he took a risk and life is all about taking risks. But I guess hes not a movie star.        
	Hussain is over 90 and Shah Rukh is in his early 40s.        
	The BJP, which swam with the pro-Shah Rukh tide, iterated its known position on Husain. If he has hurt Hindu sentiments, he should first reflect on his wrongdoing, said Lok Sabha MP Gopinath Munde.        
	A known votary of cultural tolerance in the BJP was unyielding. I challenge him to paint blasphemous portraits of the Qatar rulers family and face the consequences, he said.

          OUR BUREAU                      Sonia Gandhi                          
	New Delhi/Lucknow, Nov. 22: Happy birthday, Mulayam Singhji. Welcome back, Azambhai.        
	Congress chief Sonia Gandhi walked up to Mulayam Singh Yadav in the Lok Sabha to greet the Uttar Pradesh leader who turned 71 today.        
	If the gesture hinted at a bid to mend fences in an approaching winter of controversies, the Samajwadi boss went a step further. He invited an expelled leader back into the fold.        
	Mulayam, desperate to reclaim Muslim support in the heartland, offered Azam Khan the post of leader of Opposition in the Uttar Assembly.        
	His (Khans) return is certain now. He could be with us in a few hours or a few days. I have accepted most of the demands made by him, Mulayam said and added that he was ready to offer Khan the post of leader of Opposition his brother Shivpal now holds.        
	This was the first time Mulayam had publicly spoken about the return of Khan, who was sacked in April 2009 after he revolted against Mulayams decision to join hands with former BJP leader Kalyan Singh.        
	Party insiders said the Samajwadi chief had bent a lot for the return of the Rampur strongman who had helped him expand his base among Muslims and earn the label Maulana Mulayam.        
	The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister, however, didnt show the same softness towards the Congress and said his party wouldnt budge from the demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the spectrum controversy. The Congress-led UPA II has become arrogant, he said.         
	In Lucknow, Mulayams supporters celebrated the day with a montage of 272 photographs since the seventies that didnt include a single one of his one-time lieutenant Amar Singh. Sources close to the socialist veteran said Mulayam wants to shed his champagne socialist tag.        
	The now-expelled Amar was, after all, the partys link with Bollywood and industry, lending a touch of elitism to the party. That is why Mulayam Singh now wants to fumigate his party from Amar Singhs influence, said a source.

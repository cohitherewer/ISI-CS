	New Delhi, Aug 9 (PTI): Trinamool Congress' rally in Maoist-affected Lalgarh had its echo in Parliament today with Left members seeking to know the Centre's stand on the alleged hobnobbing of the UPA ally with the extremists, dubbing the meeting as an "anti-national activity".
    The BJP and the BJD also used the opportunity to attack the Centre.
    Amid strong protests from the Trinamool Congress in Lok Sabha, A Sampath (CPI-M) said the Centre must spell out its stand on the public meeting in view of the Maoist-backed People's Committee against Police Atrocities (PCPA) supporting the rally called today by Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee.
    Without taking the name of Trinamool Congress or Banerjee, he wondered during the Zero Hour how could a UPA ally, including its leader who is a Union Minister, could align with Maoists, described by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as the biggest threat to internal security.

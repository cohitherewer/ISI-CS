	Lucknow, Sept. 20: One of the three judges hearing the Ayodhya case today sprang a belated dissent verdict, differing with the benchs decision on Friday to reject petitions seeking postponement of the September 24 judgment on the title suit.        
	Justice Dharam Veer Sharma, the senior-most judge on the bench, created a flutter with his potentially controversial claim that Justice S.U. Khan and Justice Sudhir Agarwal had not even consulted him before passing Fridays judgment.        
	Technically, Justice Sharmas move does not affect the September 17 judgment, which stands by a 2-1 majority decision. This means the upcoming verdict on the title suit, by the same three-judge bench, too remains scheduled for September 24.        
	However, legal experts said the dissent verdict might encourage the petitioners, who wanted a mediated settlement, to challenge the September 17 verdict in the Supreme Court. If the top court admits the appeal, it will be expected to stay the September 24 judgment.        
	Prashanth Chandra, lawyer for pro-mediation petitioner Ramesh Chandra Tripathi, appeared to drop a hint.        
	From the latest development, it seems the Supreme Court is the only place where (we) can hope to get a final judgment, he told The Telegraph. I am happy to have the support of one judge at least.                    
	If no interventions occur, the title verdict would by now be expected to be ready for pronouncement on Friday but no one apart from the judges can possibly know whether it too contains a dissent note  and if so, from which of the three judges.        
	Although dissent verdicts are not unusual, one from Justice Khan  whether it came on the September 17 judgment or the one scheduled for September 24  could have led to credibility issues since he is the sole minority judge on the bench.        
	Some jurists had suggested the bench include a judge from some other religion  a Parsi, Christian or Sikh  though justice is supposed to be blind and judges above the influence of community or personal faith.        
	The unusual feature of Justice Sharmas dissent is its timing: three days after the original verdict. Dissent notes are usually included as part of the main judgment, with the judges agreeing to disagree and to go by majority decision.        
	Additional solicitor-general Ashok Nigam clarified that a judge can choose to pass a belated dissent note. Many advocates, though, felt Justice Sharma should have registered his dissent on September 17 itself.        
	On Friday, as Justice Khan and Justice Agarwal passed the verdict, Justice Sharma had sat mostly quietly.        
	I am sorry to state that at the time of the passing of the order I was not consulted, otherwise, I would have given my views to honourable brother judges, Justice Sharma, who is due to retire on October 1, said in his nine-page order, issued from his chamber and circulated among lawyers.        
	He said he was unable to agree that the petitioners were mischievous or lacked bona fides. He ruled that petitioner Tripathi need not pay the fine of Rs 50,000, a penalty the other two judges had initially discussed before postponing a decision.        
	Zafaryab Jilani, advocate for the Sunni Central Wakf Board, one of the plaintiffs in the title suit, said: We cannot speculate how this dissent note would impact the forthcoming verdict on September 24, but the judge appears not averse to delivering the judgment on September 24.        
	His reference was to the dissent note asking the petitioners to submit their plans for an out-of-court settlement before September 24.        
	If any judge pulls out of a bench before the verdict, the entire case has to be heard again. The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court has been hearing the title suit since 1989, when it was transferred from a Faizabad court.        
	Dissent verdicts are not unusual in Indian courts. In May this year, Justice B. Sudershan Reddy had delivered one in the case where then Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justice P. Sathasivam offered relief to Mukesh Ambani in his battle against Anil Ambani over cheap gas.        
	In August 2006, when a Supreme Court bench rejected a petition alleging Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi had interfered in the judicial process in wealth and tax cases against them, Justice S.H. Kapadia (now Chief Justice) had disagreed with Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justice A.R. Lakshmanan.

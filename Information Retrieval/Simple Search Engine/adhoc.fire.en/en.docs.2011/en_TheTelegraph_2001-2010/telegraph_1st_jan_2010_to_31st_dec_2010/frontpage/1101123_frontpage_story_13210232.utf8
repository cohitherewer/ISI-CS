The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cess cloud on Asim appeal 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cess cloud on Asim appeal 
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 22: Asim Dasgupta is in Delhi to seek a financial bailout for Bengal but the Centre is citing a twice-affirmed cabinet decision that blocks a largesse the state finance minister has been banking on.        
	Central officials said the cabinet decision made it impossible to give the largest chunk of funds  Rs 4,883 crore in coal royalty arrears  to Bengal.        
	According to the cabinet decision, the royalty arrears cannot be given to Bengal as the state charges a cess.        
	The Centre gives royalty to fuel-bearing states. But Bengal levies a 25 per cent cess on companies that mine coal, because of which the Centre has not revised the royalty rate for the state since 1991-92.        
	Dasgupta had recently told The Telegraph that as the Centre did not allow the state to collect royalty at enhanced rates, the state exchequer suffered a notional loss of Rs 4,833 crore.         
	With Bengals finances in a mess, Dasgupta has been pinning hopes on this unresolved arrears to tackle the crisis.        
	The smaller change the state government seeks by way of interest relief, compensation for tax losses, Aila aid and drought relief will, however, come through over the next few months.        
	Dasgupta managed to ensure such an assurance from Pranab Mukherjee at an hour-long meeting here today.        
	We had a positive meeting with the Union finance minister about central funds which are due to West Bengal Pranabbabu has promised expeditious action to release some of the funds, he said.        
	However, asked under which heads the funds will be released, Dasgupta added: I will not go into the specifics of which money will be given at this stage.        
	Sources said the assistance and compensation would total around Rs 2,900 crore.         
	However, the big-ticket demand for coal royalty arrears cannot be given as there was a cabinet decision in 2002 and then again in 2007 which says the Centre will not give the higher royalty rate to Bengal because it is charging a cess, a source said.        
	The cabinet had three years ago decided to hike coal royalty rates by 14 per cent to give coal-bearing states an annual income of over Rs 3,700 crore. For the state government, the 25 per cent cess was more attractive when viewed against the royalty rate of 14-19 per cent.         
	Todays meeting between Dasgupta and Mukherjee was attended by expenditure secretary Sushma Nath. Nath had earlier hauled up the state government for letting its finances go downhill.        
	Dasgupta referred to an initiative that could earn him some goodwill from Mukherjee. We also discussed the goods and services tax and the constitutional amendments needed to get the act through, Dasgupta said.        
	Mukherjee has been keen on pushing through the legislation that will usher in an all-India tax, reducing levies on businesses and increasing efficiency. However, BJP-ruled states have been playing hardball.

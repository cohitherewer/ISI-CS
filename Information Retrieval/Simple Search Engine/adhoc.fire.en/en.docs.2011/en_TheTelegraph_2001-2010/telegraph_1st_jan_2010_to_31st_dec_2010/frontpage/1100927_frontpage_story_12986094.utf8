                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Vigilance to expedite land scam probe
          RUDRA BISWAS                            MV Rao: Setting a deadline                                  
	Ranchi, Sept. 26: The vigilance bureau has pressed the express button to complete investigations into the Rs 400-crore Ranchi land scam, which is more than a decade old, within a month.        
	Chargesheets will soon be filed in connection with cases that involved illegal transfer of 200 acres of government and tribal land in and around the capital to housing co-operatives and individuals.         
	The vigilance bureau had filed 10 FIRs when it took over the case from the Bihar authorities after Jharkhand was born in 2000. On November 18 last year, chargesheets were drawn up against 30 accused in five cases. The bureau plans to file chargesheets in the remaining cases by the end of next month.        
	We reviewed progress of investigations into the 10 cases related to the Ranchi land scam today and firmly resolved to complete probe at the earliest. All these cases are old and were lodged under the then Bihar government. Instructions have been issued to solve the cases within the next month, M.V. Rao, IG (Vigilance), told The Telegraph.        
	He said of the 10 cases, four had been nearly disposed of. In case of two others, clarifications are required from the high court. Investigations into the remaining four cases will be completed on a priority basis, he stressed.        
	The list of land scam accused includes former South Chotanagpur commissioner S.S. Verma, who is now posted in Bihar, 12 circle officers, nine sub-divisional officers and 12 additional collectors of Bihar Administrative Services.        
	The land scam had first come to light in 1995. Then Bihar land revenue minister and currently member of Lok Sabha Inder Singh Namdhari had claimed that bureaucrats and other state officials had colluded with the land mafia to sell off more than 200 acres of tribal and government land worth Rs 400 crore.        
	In 1998, the then Bihar government ordered a vigilance inquiry into the scam. A seven-member all-party Bihar Assembly committee was also constituted to look into 21 cases of illegal transfer of government land. A report submitted by the committee had indicted several circle officers, additional collectors and Verma for complicity.         
	In 2000, following the creation of Jharkhand, all cases were transferred to the state vigilance bureau, which lodged FIR in connection with 10.

          NICK ALLEN                            Bullock with her husband Jesse James at an Oscar party in Los Angeles. (AP)				                                 
	Los Angeles, March 18: Sandra Bullock, the Oscar-winning Hollywood star, pulled out of the London premiere of her hit film The Blind Side as a US celebrity magazine published a claim that her husband cheated on her.        
	Bullock 45, who won the Oscar for best actress last week, had been due in London to promote the drama. But a statement issued by film studio Warner Bros said: Due to unforeseen personal reasons a trip abroad to support The Blind Side has been deemed impossible at this time.        
	I apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused and thank you for your continued support of the film. The announcement came as In Touch magazine published an interview with a heavily tattooed model called Michelle Bombshell McGee, who claimed to have slept with Bullocks husband while the actress was away in Atlanta filming The Blind Side last year.        
	Bullock married custom motorcycle manufacturer and reality television star Jesse James, 40, in 2005. In several award ceremonies earlier this year the actress attributed much of her recent success to her happiness at home. After her Oscar win James said: Nobody deserves this more and works harder.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                When Deutschland came to CC amp;FC
  - German glory in former British bastion          ANDI PHRINGER                            Germanys Thomas Mueller scores the fourth goal against England on Sunday. (Reuters)                                        
	I admit that I may not be the typical football fan following each game throughout the year. But the World Cup is the World Cup. And as a German working and living in Calcutta, I was delighted when my friend Debanjan invited me to watch the England vs Germany match at the Calcutta Cricket amp; Football Club.        
	Calcutta, with all its football enthusiasm, is anyway a great place to experience such an important match. And the CC amp;FC is surely the place where the Bengali football fever started long ago.        
	The English football team has always been feared in Germany. And, when you are sitting in a football club founded by some British guys as long ago as 1792, you understand why. England has been a great football nation not just for years but for centuries.        
	Packed with football fans, the atmosphere in the club was great. The match could be seen in both the bars and in the restaurant downstairs. Debanjan and I got seats on a leather sofa just in front of one of the big screens. Perfect!        
	The match started with great speed. Soon a goal-kick from the German goalkeeper, Neuer, landed far within the English half, where nobody seemed to feel responsible until Klose outmuscled Upson and placed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner of the English goal.        
	Tor! Tor! Tor! as we would shout in Germany.        
	The atmosphere was rocking and it was heartening to see the entire audience cheering for both sides. Debanjan and I were the exceptions: he only cheered for England and I for Germany!        
	It felt as if I was at home except when my beer arrived in one of these small 300ml glasses. To really enjoy a football match a South German normally needs a Weizenbier served in nicely shaped half-litre glasses to boost his spirits throughout the match. But then, the succulent kebabs in the Club nearly made up for that.        
	Perhaps the only weak moment was when the English goal did not get counted. Even I nearly felt slightly bad when the TV replays showed how Lampards shot, which hit the underside of the bar, was well over the goal-line. Well, I guess one could consider that a late payback for Geoff Hursts shot in 1966. Sorry, Debanjan!        
	But what a match! 4:1!        
	Both sides played outstanding football. Later, even some of my Brazilian friends in town agreed that this had been the best match in this World Cup so far.        
	Thank you Thomas Muller for your two goals, thanks Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski for your strikes. Thanks Schweinsteiger. Thanks Debanjan for the beer and kebabs. And thank you CC amp;FC for the outstanding atmosphere. It was a memorable night.        
	Deutschland! Deutschland! Hurra!

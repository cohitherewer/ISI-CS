          OUR BUREAU                                     
	Jan. 4: Unidentified militants fired on a police convoy, killing a constable and injuring two others, including a sub-inspector, this afternoon on the Haflong-Mahur road in North Cachar Hills, breaking a seven-month lull in the otherwise violence-prone district.         
	Two siblings, one of them a 10-year-old girl, also died in the ambush after they were caught in the crossfire as the security forces retaliated after the gunmen, hiding in the foliage on both sides of the road, opened fire on the two-vehicle Assam Police convoy.         
	The rebels managed to flee.        
	The incident took place near Impui Basti, a small settlement of Zeme Nagas around 10km from Mahur and about 75km from the district headquarters of Haflong.         
	The slain constable has been identified as Lamuat Throngia, 27, of the Special Task Force attached to 12 Assam Police Battalion. The constable belonged to Titabar in Jorhat.         
	Sub-inspector Khitish Kumar Bora and constable Rantu Khungia of the 2nd Assam Police battalion were injured in the attack. Bora hails from Nagaon, while Khungia comes from Sivasagar district. The two have been admitted to Silchar Medical College Hospital for treatment.        
	The civilians are yet to be identified.         
	NC Hills deputy commissioner S. Jagannathan said over phone that the identity of the group in the ambush was yet to be ascertained.         
	Mahur police station officer-in-charge Nandeswar Bey, who was in a Maruti Gypsy, the vehicle that led the convoy, had a narrow escape. His vehicle was riddled with bullets but none of the occupants were injured.         
	The second vehicle, a 407 mini van, took the full impact of the fusillade of bullets fired by the militants. It happened very suddenly and by the time our men retaliated, the rebels had already fled, Bey told The Telegraph over phone.         
	The second vehicle had 12 occupants, including the civilian driver.        
	The convoy was returning to Mahur from Laisung on patrol duty.         
	The injured personnel were initially admitted to Mahur civil hospital but later shifted to Haflong civil hospital from where they were airlifted to Silchar for treatment.         
	Krishna Kemprai, superintendent of Haflong Civil Hospital, said Khungia took bullets in his stomach and hands while Bora was hit in the back of his left arm and left hand.         
	A senior police official at Haflong said that the incident could be the handiwork of NSCN (Khaplang) rebels.        
	Police had killed two Khaplang rebels about two weeks ago near Haflong in an encounter. Todays attack could be in retaliation to that, the official added.               
	KLNLF move        
	The Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF) today said that the outfit would soon come overground and asked Union home minister P. Chidambaram to be present at the surrender ceremony.        
	Addressing a press meet at Diphu this evening, KLNLF publicity secretary Rejek Dera said four designated camps would be set up in Karbi Anglong after the surrender.

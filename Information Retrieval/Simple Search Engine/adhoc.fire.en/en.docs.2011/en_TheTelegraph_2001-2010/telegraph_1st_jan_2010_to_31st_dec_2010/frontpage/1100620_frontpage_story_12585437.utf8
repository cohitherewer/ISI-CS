          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Kohima, June 19: Sumi Hoho, the apex organisation of Sumis in Nagaland, has banned NSCN (I-M) general secretary Thiungaleng Muivah from entering areas inhabited by the indigenous community in the state.        
	Muivah is scheduled to visit Pughoboto, the hometown of NSCN (I-M) chairman Isak Chishi Swu, in Zunheboto district on Monday. The hoho took the decision during a meeting of all frontal organisations of Sumis at Zunheboto town yesterday.        
	A representative of the hoho said the statements made on Sumis by the NSCN (I-M) under the leadership of Muivah have sown seeds of discord between the outfit and the Sumi people. The organisation maintained that Muivah had no moral right to visit Sumi soil.        
	We will not allow him (Muivah) to enter our land. Why should we allow him to enter when they (the NSCN-IM) had banned us, Sumi Hoho president Hokishe Yepthomi told this correspondent. The NSCN (I-M) had banned Sumi Hoho in 2008 for its alleged nexus with the NSCN (Khaplang).         
	The NSCN (K) has also warned Muivah that he would not be allowed to enter Zunheboto. On June 16, Muivah had sent an olive branch to NSCN (K) chairman S.S. Khaplang but alleged that the outfits general secretary N. Kitovi Zhimomi was against the reconciliation process. Zhimomi lives in Zunheboto town.         
	The NSCN (K) had recently summoned the village chiefs of Pughoboto subdivision and warned them not to let Muivah in. But in clear defiance of the Khaplang threat, the people have decided to welcome Muivah. The decision was taken yesterday during a public meeting in Pughoboto town.         
	The NSCN (I-M) said Muivah, who is on a goodwill mission to facilitate the ongoing reconciliation process among Naga factions, would visit Pughoboto.         
	Muivah said he would visit Nagaland districts before his next schedule.         
	The Khaplang group has also skipped the ongoing Naga reconciliation meeting at Chiang Mai in Thailand, which has been sponsored by several international organisations, churches and the Forum for Naga Reconciliation.         
	Konyak Union, the apex body of Konyak indigenous community, said it would neither welcome nor oppose Muivahs visit to Mon. NSCN (K) commander-in-chief Khole Konyak hails from Mon.

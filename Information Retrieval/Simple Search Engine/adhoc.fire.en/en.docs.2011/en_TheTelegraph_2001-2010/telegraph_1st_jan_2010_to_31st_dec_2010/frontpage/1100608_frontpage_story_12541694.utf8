          RASHEED KIDWAI                                      
	Bhopal, June 7: As accused Kishor Kamdar, his shoulders drooping, walked up to the court gates alone, he was stopped by police.        
	Twenty-six years after the tragedy, it was perhaps difficult to recognise some of the guilty, none of whom had spent a single night in a jail or lock-up.        
	I am Kamdar, accused number three, the then vice-president of Union Carbide India said slowly as rights activists, survivors and journalists sized him up.        
	Kamdar, however, seemed oblivious to the looks of hatred or the odd derisive remark directed at him.        
	Aaiye, aaiye, a policewoman almost welcomed him in with a smile.        
	Kamdar stepped in without a glance at Hamida Bi or the dozens of others who had lost loved ones in the gas leak.        
	Gas victim Shahnawaz Khan, however, had no trouble recognising J. Mukund, former works manager at the Union Carbide factory. Khan, a lawyer, said he felt like grabbing Mukund and shaking him but restrained himself fearing the courts wrath.        
	On March 24, 1983, some 20 months before the disaster, Khan had sent a legal notice to Mukund saying the 50,000 people living around the factory may be exposed to poisonous gas. Mukund had replied that Khans anxiety was unfounded and baseless.        
	I wish I had the guts to hold him, shake him up and leave him to his destiny, Khan said, tears rolling down his cheeks. I am a small man. I failed that day (to stop the leak) and I failed today.        
	Victim and former Union Carbide mechanic Ram Charan Batham said K.V. Shetty, the then plant superintendent, owed him an explanation.        
	On the afternoon of December 2, 1984, Batham had called up district collector Moti Singh and said he feared that small amounts of poisonous gas were leaking out of the factory. But a team of officials that included Shetty dismissed the claim. Nine hours later, catastrophe struck.         
	Inside the courtroom, the guilty men sat in the first three rows, their heads down and eyes fixed on the floor. There were six of them  the seventh, S.I. Qureshi, was absent because of poor health.        
	As chief judicial magistrate Mohan P. Tiwari began pronouncing the judgment amid a ruckus outside the courtroom, some among the six men looked relieved.        
	Vijay Gokhale, then Union Carbide India managing director, had spoken of how the tragedy had cast a long shadow over his life and that of his family. He had said he wanted closure. While my family and friends have stood rock solid behind me all the way, social acquaintances had a field day. At parties, some of the jabs I took were: Are you Nathuram Godse or Vijay Gokhale? Gokhale had told an interviewer six years ago.        
	Keshub Mahindra, 86, then Union Carbide India non-executive chairman and now the chairman of Mahindra amp; Mahindra, had declined the Padma Bhushan in 2002. He had written to then home minister L.K. Advani, saying: It was important to put absolute sanctity of the national awards above personal satisfaction.        
	Mahindra had said: It is known that I was not in any way involved with the day-to-day operations of that company. I sympathise deeply with all who suffered. I can also empathise with their frustration at the protracted process of providing assistance.        
	The gas victims blamed the CBI. Lawyer Khan said the investigative agency had failed to take account of either his legal notice to Union Carbide or Mukunds reply.        
	The CBI never produced Batham, the mechanic, as a witness, either.

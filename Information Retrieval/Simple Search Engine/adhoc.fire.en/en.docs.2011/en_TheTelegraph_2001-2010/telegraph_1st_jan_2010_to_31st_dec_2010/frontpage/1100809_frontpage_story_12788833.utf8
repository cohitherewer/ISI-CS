          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Jamshedpur, Aug. 8: The 24-hour Maoist bandh in Jharkhand, Bihar and Chhattisgarh was total in the rural areas of mineral-rich Kolhan today after last nights jitters when rebels tried to blow up a school building in Palamau, half-an-hour before the shutdown came into force.        
	The incident took place at Kandla village, around 30km from Daltonganj, when a group of armed Maoists damaged a school partially in an explosion, Palamau superintendent of police Anup T. Mathew said. The rebels had called the bandh in protest against the arrest of one of their leaders, Rajesh Sinha, alias Udayji.         
	Shops and business establishments remained closed in Ghatshila and other townships of East Singhbhum since early morning. Vehicles kept off roads while commercial organisations, including banks and ATMs, downed shutters. National Highway 33 also remained deserted.         
	DIG, Kolhan, Naveen Kumar Singh said there were no reports of violence from the twin districts of Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mighty master, meek serf
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mighty master, meek serf
          AMIT ROY, G.S. MUDUR AND BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                            Anand during a simultaneous game with 39 mathematicians in Hyderabad on Tuesday. All but one, 14-year-old Bangalore schoolboy Srikar Varadaraj, lost to the grandmaster. Srikar drew the game. (PTI picture)                                   
	Aug. 24: Manmohan Singh should be relieved that Kapil Sibal does not run the United Kingdom. Equally indebted to such a quirk of fate should be Amartya Sen, Ratan Tata and Bill Gates.         
	All four have managed to take home honorary degrees from either Cambridge or Oxford, untrammelled by the gimlet glare of either the Queen or Her Majestys government there and escaping the fate that befell world chess champion Viswanathan Anand in Hyderabad.        
	The uncomplaining Anand left the venue of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) without the honorary doctoral degree promised by the university but with the satisfaction of having beaten 38 of the 39 math brains he played against simultaneously.        
	As reported in The Telegraph on Tuesday, the University of Hyderabad could not grant Anand the honorary doctoral degree it had proposed earlier this year after the bureaucracy in Delhi raised questions about his citizenship and delayed processing related documents.         
	Human resource development minister Sibal scrambled to control the damage by personally apologising to Anand this morning.        
	But the minister let the nanny cat  the mindset that stifles academic freedom in India  out of the bag when he said: Were ready to hand over the degree to him whenever he wishes.        
	Which begs the question if Sibal and his officials  unless he chose the majestic plural we to describe his exalted self  have appointed themselves or himself the vice-chancellor(s) of India.        
	Such degrees should be the business of universities, not ministers and their bureaucracy. But Sibal has gone one up on the late Anil Biswas (the erstwhile CPM Bengal secretary who fine-tuned the art of controlling the education establishment without appearing to do so) by declaring in public he decides what universities in the country should do, said a chronicler of such matters in Calcutta.         
	However, in the sycophantic academic atmosphere in the country, varsity officials sometimes bend over backwards to humour those in power or do not challenge rules designed to shackle the academic environs. Sources said a senior varsity official was insisting till this morning that Anand was Spanish, probably mixing up the chess wizards place of residence and country.         
	The Hyderabad university has cited Rule 29 (1) of its statute to justify its approach to the Union ministry for forwarding its proposal to the Visitor (in this case the President of India). The executive council may, on the recommendation of the academic council and by a resolution passed by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting, make proposal to the Visitor for the conferment of honorary degrees, the rule states.        
	The rule is so loosely drafted that an independent-minded varsity should have had no difficulty in conferring such degrees on its own. But the varsity appears to have played safe, sending the proposal for permission several months ago and hoping that the ministry would get it cleared.        
	The tale of the degree proposal itself is worthy of a doctorate in red tape.        
	 Sibal said he approved Anands name on May 22 but indicated the delays were linked to the HRD ministry and the university. There were some errors on our side, he said, adding that the university did not specify that the degree was to be conferred during the math congress.        
	The list was sent to the Visitors office on June 2. But the Visitors office wanted details about one of the awardees. By the time the details were furnished, the regular convocation got over.         
	The university again decided to give honorary degrees to Anand and a senior American mathematician, David Mumford, at the ICM. The list again came to the ministry for clearance from the Visitor. This time also the Visitors office sought clarifications about an awardee and, in the process, it was delayed.         
	That is the whole point, said several academics. Why should the ministry and the President get involved?         
	My view is that this matter of awarding honorary degrees should be left to the university and its chancellor, Delhi University vice-chancellor Deepak Pental said. He said a universitys Visitor should not be troubled over honorary degrees.         
	It also emerged that there was no uniform rule. B.B. Bhattacharya, the vice-chancellor of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, said JNU did not need to seek such clearances. At JNU, we give degrees on our own  a university should be allowed to honour anybody it decides, Bhattacharya said.         
	Told of the fiasco in Hyderabad, British universities threw up their hands in horror at the suggestion that the UK government should clear the names of the people academic institutions wished to honour.        
	 The idea is almost too absurd to be dignified with a reply, one academic said, asked by The Telegraph whether a similar situation could occur in the UK.        
	We dont ask the government, said a spokesperson for Oxford. Any member of the university is free to nominate a candidate for an honorary degree, with a senior Oxford committee then taking the final decision.                                         
	At Cambridge, the spokesman was equally firm. The government has no role, he said. Its an internal matter. UK varsities enjoy another right Indian masters will find heretic: they also dare turn down suggestions to that somebody be honoured.         
	At Oxford, a proposal to honour the Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher was once famously knocked down by members of the university. Similarly, the universitys decision to honour Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had to be withdrawn because of the Pakistani leaders role in the war over Bangladesh  even though the British government of the day might well have liked the honour to have been awarded.        
	 Nor is the system any different at Liverpool Hope University which honoured the Mahatma Gandhis grandson, Rajmohan Gandhi, earlier this summer.         
	 A spokesman could not be clearer. We dont need to seek permission before we award an honorary degree, he said. The university has full degree awarding powers. When it comes to honorary awards, we have a committee of senior academics who nominate and rigorously scrutinise the credentials of the candidates. The selections then go before University Council for the final approval.        
	So, is there any hope in India? Hear out Sibal: the institutions will now be asked to provide all details about the persons to be awarded so that a similar problem will be avoided.

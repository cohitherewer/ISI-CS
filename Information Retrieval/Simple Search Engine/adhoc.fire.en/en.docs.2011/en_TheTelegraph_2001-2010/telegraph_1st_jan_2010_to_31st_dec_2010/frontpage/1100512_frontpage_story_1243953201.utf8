                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                BJP rules out rotational power-sharing with JMM in Jharkhand
										                BJP senior leader Venkaiah Naidu. A PTI file picture      
	Bangalore, May 12 (PTI): BJP today ruled out sharing of power on a rotational basis with JMM in Jharkhand and asserted that it will soon form the government with its leader as Chief Minister.  
	 "There is no question of 50:50 ratio power sharing with JMM. We will have BJP Chief Minister in Jharkhand soon," BJP senior leader Venkaiah Naidu told reporters here.   
	The JMM had on May 10 asked BJP to share power with it on a rotational basis, two days after the latter said it would head the coalition for the rest of the four-and- half-year tenure of the present Assembly.   
	To a question, Naidu said the delay in government formation was not due to differences of opinion on selection of a chief ministerial candidate, but on account of wider consultations on the issue among party leaders.   
	Accusing the central government of misusing CBI in a "brazen manner" to further its political interests, Naidu demanded a "White Paper" on the functioning of the investigation agency.  
	 The White Paper should contain information on number of cases referred, registered, investigated and prosecuted by CBI, and the number of cases withdrawn and dropped in between, he said.  
	 "CBI has become the political arm of the government, be it trial of strength during the confidence motion in July 2008 or the recent cut motions in Lok Sabha," Naidu said.  
	 He alleged that Congress was adopting all "unethical, extra-constitutional and immoral" methods by misusing various institutions to further its political interests, harass political opponents and also muster support as and when needed.   
	The BJP has embarked upon a public awakening campaign from today across the country against the "politicisation of CBI".   
	He termed as "irresponsible and baseless" the charge by former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh that terrorism was on the rise after L K Advani undertook rath yatra.

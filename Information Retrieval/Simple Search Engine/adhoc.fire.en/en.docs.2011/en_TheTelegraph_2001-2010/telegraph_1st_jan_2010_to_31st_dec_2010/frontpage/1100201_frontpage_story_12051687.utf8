  - Little chance of nod to   ballot from abroad         K.P. NAYAR                            A delegate at the meeting in Delhi on January 8. (PTI)                                              
	Washington, Jan. 31: Mil  lions of Indians abroad, who   had rejoiced earlier this   month that Prime Minister   Manmohan Singh had recog  nised their legitimate desire   to vote in elections back home,   are discovering that voting   rights for them will remain a   mirage.        
	The government is merely   planning to include their   names in the voters lists of   the constituencies where they   were domiciled in India.  
	There are no plans to en  able them to vote at Indian em  bassies or other designated   voting centres abroad during   elections back home, as most   countries ranging from the US   to Venezuela that allow their   overseas citizens to cast bal  lots.  
	This will mean that an In  dian resident in New York, for   instance, will have to spend a   few thousand dollars, travel to   his original home or residence   of choice and be present in his   constituency on voting day to   cast his ballot in any poll in   India.  
	The Prime Minister had   said on January 8, while inau  gurating the eighth Pravasi   Bharatiya Divas, an annual   gathering of people from   abroad of Indian origin, that   non-resident Indians (NRIs)   should have a say on who gov  erns India. He added: I sin  cerely hope that they will get a   chance to vote by the time of   the next regular general elec  tions.  
	Sources in the Prime Min  isters Office (PMO) working   on the issue said they expected   Singhs statement to revive a   report on NRI voting rights   from a parliamentary stand  ing committee, which has   been dormant with the Union   law ministry for over three   years.  
	Prime ministerial state  ments usually act as catalysts   in government, and issues   which have been neglected for   years have a habit of magical  ly coming to life. So it will be   for NRIs hoping for their right   to vote in Indian elections.  
	But the catch is that the   three-year-old report from the   standing committee on per  sonnel, public grievances, law   and justice merely provides   for the names of NRIs to be in  cluded in the rolls in their con  stituencies of domicile.  
	The Representation of Peo  ples Act will have to be   amended to make this possi  ble: under the existing law, any   Indian who has not resided   continuously in his or her nor  mal place of residence for six   months before a revision of   the electoral rolls is struck off   the list and cannot vote. This   will be amended to enable   their names to remain on the   rolls if they are working,   studying or have gone abroad   for any other legitimate pur  poses.  
	The Prime Ministers   statement this month had   raised high hopes among over  seas Indians that they will be   able to take part in elections in   India from their locations   abroad as early as 2014.  
	But in South Block, con  cerns are said to have been   raised that the prospect of mil  lions of Indians queuing up in   the Gulf states for voting   would send shivers down the   spines of many Arab despots   who do not give their citizens   any democratic rights.  
	Fears have been expressed   that Gulf states may even   move to stop implementation   in their jurisdictions of any   Indian law amending the act   in order to prevent their own   citizens from being witnesses   to the excitement of democra  cy in action.  
	Officials of the Union   home ministry have been, for   decades, institutionally op  posed to anything that allows   those abroad  Indians or for  eigners  any more rights in   any sphere because of their   paranoia over Khalistanis and   Pakistanis. They are bound to   oppose anything that goes be  yond the limited changes pro  posed to the act by the parlia  mentary standing committee.   The committees report was   based on a bill tabled in the   Rajya Sabha on this subject in 2006.  
	The Union cabinet has already cleared the amendments to the act and these are now under consideration. It is unlikely that the cabinet will make further changes that allow Indians to vote abroad like Americans and other developed democracies.  
	Several Union ministers are of the view that the problem of domestic migrants being unable to vote in India because of changes in their residence must be aggressively addressed before NRIs are allowed to vote, only because they constitute a more affluent lobby.  
	International organisations which deal with migration estimate that between 100 to 200 million Indians change their place of residence between general elections: most of them are disenfranchised because of the cumbersome procedures for electoral registration.in India.

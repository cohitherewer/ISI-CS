The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Simon push   for Sita berth
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Simon push   for Sita berth
          RAJESH KUMAR PANDEY                                    
	Dumka, Sept. 19: JMM is headed for a stormy party convention, beginning tomorrow, with firebrand Littipara MLA Simon Marandi upping the berth ante again, but this time in favour of Shibu Sorens widowed daughter-in-law and Jama legislator Sita Soren.        
	Simons demand  coming a day after the JMM chief categorically said it was impossible to please all MLAs  is likely to widen the rift within the party at its ninth convention, scheduled in Dumka for the next three days.         
	Reason: Soren, despite pressure from senior party leaders to include Sita in the new cabinet, may not be prompt because the latter was largely instrumental in jeopardising his government by not vacating her seat to facilitate a by-election.        
	If Hemant Soren, a political novice, can become the deputy chief minister by virtue of being the son of the party chief, why cant Sita Soren be provided with a cabinet berth? Simon said, speaking to The Telegraph today.         
	He pointed out that Sitas claim to carry forward the political legacy of the Soren family was more authentic, as her husband, the late Durga Soren, had made significant contributions to strengthen the party even in the face of adversities.        
	Advocating greater role for Sita at the organisational level (read in the new central committee to be formed at the conference), Simon revealed that there were attempts by a section of the party leadership to introduce the post of working president for Hemant at the convention.         
	The same, he said, would be vehemently opposed. Hemant has been at the helm of affairs for the last couple of years. What about our sacrifices during the statehood movement led by Guruji (Shibu Soren)? he said.        
	Simon has been mobilising dissident JMM MLAs, particularly those from Santhal Pargana, on the berth issue to cause much embarrassment to Soren at a time when the JMM has to form its new central committee for another three years.        
	On his claim to a cabinet berth, Simon, who along with his wife has been representing the Littipara Assembly seat for three and a half decades as JMM nominees, flashed the minority card.         
	If a Muslim MLA can be accommodated in the ministry from the minority quota, why should a Christian be deprived? he said, warning that it might scupper the partys poll prospects in the future since a sizeable section of voters belonged to his community.

  - People pelt stones, cops burst teargas         OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Dibrugarh, March 30: Scores of people were injured as security forces opened blank fire, burst teargas shells and wielded the baton to disperse a 2,000-strong mob that stormed the office of the deputy commissioner and pelted stones, injuring some policemen, in Dhemaji district of Upper Assam this morning.         
	The people, mostly villagers, had assembled under the banner of Krishak Mukti Sangram Samity in support of their demands, including a high-level inquiry into alleged gross anomalies in the public distribution system and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act in the district.         
	They also sought an immediate halt to the construction of mega dams without carrying out proper downstream impact study.        
	Around 100 persons, including the general secretary of the samity and RTI activist Akhil Gogoi, were injured in the police action. Of these, 23 were admitted to Dhemaji civil hospital. The condition of two women, Punyawati Payeng and Bina Dehingia, is stated to be critical, a source said.         
	Gogoi said the use of force to disperse a peaceful mob was sheer dominating attitude on the part of the civil administration.         
	Dhemaji deputy commissioner P. Ashok Babu said he had in writing asked the samitys leaders to meet him before 11.30am, as he would not be available after that because of prior official engagements.         
	However, the mob of around 2,000 people came to the office after that and asked for the deputy commissioner to turn up within 15 minutes. On being informed about his unavailability, the KMSS leaders refused to meet the additional deputy commissioner, Unnat Baruah, an official said.        
	Sensing a law and order problem, the administration called for a huge contingent of security forces to be deployed on the premises of the deputy commissioners office.         
	The contingent, led by additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Gautam Baruah, arrived at the site shortly. Baruah was leading the team as SP Satyaraj Hazarika has been posted out of the district and his successor Pradip Ranjan Kar has not yet assumed charge on health grounds.        
	The presence of security forces fuelled the anger of the mob, which started pelting stones on the police personnel and tried to break open the main entrance in order to get inside the campus.         
	Seven policemen, including the additional SP (HQ), were injured in the stone-pelting. We were left with very few options and had to open blank fire and burst teargas shells to disperse the mob, the additional deputy commissioner said.         
	Under his orders, security forces also resorted to a baton charge in order to chase away the mob, which had entered the premises of the DCs office by then. The krishak samity said it would continue to fight for the rights of farmers and the downtrodden.

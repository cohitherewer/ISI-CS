	Dhanbad, March 27: Coal India Ltd is exploring options to pass on the benefits of its proposed public offer to project affected people who were yet to receive compensation.        
	CIL chairman P.S. Bhattacharyya, who arrived here from Calcutta today, told reporters that part of the compensation due to those who had given up their land for various CIL projects, could be in the form of shares.         
	But since there were certain legal complications, the allotments would be done at a later stage. Besides, the break-up is being worked out by a committee and a final picture would emerge next month, he told The Telegraph.        
	CIL, the countrys largest coal producer, has the government as its only shareholder, which controls 100 per cent equity in the company. The government is planning to divest 10 per cent of its equity through a public offer in the next few months.         
	CIL is looking to further sell a percentage of the equity to its employees. Ten per cent of the listed shares, i.e. 6.316 lakh shares, would be reserved for employees who will get shares at 5 per cent lower rate than others, added Bhattacharyya, who was felicitated by the BCCL top brass at Sijua Grounds.        
	On the CILs social sector initiatives, Bhattacharrya said 125 students belonging to BPL families would be given scholarships of which 25 would be reserved for children of project affected families.        
	Among those who were present at the function were BCCL CMD T.K. Lahiri, director personnel P.E. Kacchap, director technical (operations) Rakesh Sinha, director technical (project and planning) D.C. Jha and director finance P.G. Nandi.        
	In Delhi yesterday, CIL announced a dividend of Rs 2,210 crore for financial year 2009-10 with coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal handing over the dividend cheque to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

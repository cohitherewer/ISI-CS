	Balasore (Orissa), Nov 25 (PTI) India's nuclear capable Agni-I strategic ballistic missile, which has a striking range of 700 kms, was successfully test-fired by the Army during a user trial from the Integrated Test Range at Wheeler Island off Orissa coast today.
    "The trial of Agni-I was smooth and the test flight was fully successful," ITR Director S P Dash told PTI.
    The indigenously developed surface-to-surface single-stage missile, powered by solid propellants, was test fired from a rail mobile launcher around 1010 hours from launch pad-4 of ITR, 100 km off Orissa coast, defence sources said, adding "all parameters were met during the trial." 
    User of the missile - the Strategic Force Command (SFC) of the Indian Army - as part of their training exercise, executed the entire launch operation with the logistic support provided by the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) at the ITR, said a DRDO official.

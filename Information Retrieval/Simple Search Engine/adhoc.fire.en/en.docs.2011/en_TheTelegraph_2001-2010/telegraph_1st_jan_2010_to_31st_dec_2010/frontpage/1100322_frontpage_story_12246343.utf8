          G.C. SHEKHAR                      Tharoor conversing with fellow tweeters in Chennai                           
	Chennai, March 21: If you cant keep your passport complaint to 140 letters, start practising.        
	Not only does junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoor act on grievances tweeted to him, he wants his ministry to have an official Twitter account, to be updated five times a day.        
	These remarks from Tharoor came here on Friday night at his tweetup  a real-world meeting of people who have connected via Twitter  where the contrast between the setting and the occasion was hard to escape.        
	The covered courtyard of a typically old Madras home, with its shining rosewood pillars and staircase, paintings and portraits and tastefully placed terracotta figures, was playing host to the followers of a modern communication marvel.        
	Perhaps the mismatch mirrored that between the ministers style and the establishments  one that Tharoor spent much of the evening exploring.        
	He held forth on his tweeting, his brush with the media and the way he was trying to adjust to the demands of a hyper-sensitive political set-up. The 30-odd Twitter faithfuls were too polite to entangle him in any tricky question.        
	Tharoor said tweeting had given him the little creative outlet he craved, now that he was too busy for any serious writing. I try to do it as often as I can, mostly in the car between meetings.        
	He admitted the government was not yet ready to use Twitter to receive and redress public grievances, as was happening in the western democracies. However, Tharoor said that he, his secretary Sandeep Chakravarthy and officer on special duty Jacob John had been responding to foreign ministry problems that came to them on their Twitter accounts.        
	We have responded and acted upon 25 to 35 interventions based on tweets to us from passport delay to inability to transport a dead relatives body from a foreign country, he said.        
	If I have the right to make policy, I would insist that the MEA(ministry of external affairs) has a Twitter account on which five times a day we put links to our statements, actions and announcements.        
	There was, however, a villain in the story. So far, the medias visceral reaction to my tweeting has made it really difficult to persuade anybody in politics that it is a good idea to tweet. I am hoping the media will mature, since every foreign ministry in a democracy is already doing it, Tharoor said.        
	He said he had been surprised by the way the Indian media had reacted to him.        
	I spent 29 years in the UN giving thousands of interviews and ended up supervising media relations even when it was not my job. The organisation saw me as an asset when it came to speaking to the media. It is only in India that I am a liability, as anything I say is promptly misunderstood, he said ruefully.        
	Fellow tweeters presented a bat to the cricket-loving Tharoor  who fronted a consortium that won the IPL Kochi team today  with all their Twitter IDs written on it.        
	If you use the bat then our names will disappear, a fan joked.

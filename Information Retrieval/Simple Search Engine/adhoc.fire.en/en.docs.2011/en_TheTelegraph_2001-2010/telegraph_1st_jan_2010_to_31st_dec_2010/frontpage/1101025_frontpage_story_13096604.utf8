  - Protests by villagers in Nagri mouza lead to fresh search          AMIT GUPTA                             IIM-Ranchis temporary address at Suchana Bhavan                                        
	Ranchi, Oct. 24: Protests by villagers of Nagri mouza have forced the authorities of IIM-Ranchi to scout for a new site, delaying further the premiere management cradles search for a permanent campus.        
	IIM-Ranchi director M. Joseph Xavier and convener B.B. Chakrabarty, along with Kanke circle officials, inspected a 40-acre site in Jhiri on the outskirts of the capital on October 21 in this regard. A portion of the site was being used for dumping solid waste generated in Ranchi.         
	Ranchi additional collector Birsai Oraon said the search for a new site was necessitated following protest by villagers of disputed Nagri mouza in Kanke block, where 214 acres were earmarked for IIM-Ranchi.         
	According to sources, the Nagri mouza land is disputed as the villagers from whom the land was acquired way back in the 1950s were never duly compensated and the government was never in possession of the land, which was originally acquired for Birsa Agriculture University (BAU).         
	Speaking to The Telegraph over phone from Chennai, Xavier confirmed that he had inspected both the Jhiri and Nagri sites. We want a good plot, free from encumbrances. The state government is extending every help, but finalising land for a permanent campus will take some more time, said Xavier, who will formally take charge of the management cradle on November 8.         
	Xavier and Chakrabarty also visited facilities at the National Games Village, a portion of which could be utilised for hostel facilities from the next session.         
	At present, IIM-Ranchi is operating out of a temporary address at Suchana Bhawan, where 44 students who enrolled this year for a two-year PG programme in management attend class. The training hostel of neighbouring Sri Krishna Sinha Institute of Public Administration is being used to provide residential facilities to the students.         
	Xavier added that they were open to several options and were keeping chairman of IIM-Ranchi board of governors R.C. Bhargava and director of mentor IIM-Joka Shekhar Choudhury informed.         
	Recently, the state decided to scale down the land requirements of IIM-Ranchi and Central University of Jharkhand. The IIM authorities maintained that 100 acres was the minimum required.        
	The IIM is thinking of introducing short-term management courses for serving executives in industries operating in the state. According to Xaviers, from the next academic session, the institute would aim to select 65 students for the two-year basic management programme through the Common Admission Test.         
	The authorities are also happy with the good response from qualified aspirants who have applied in large numbers to be a part of the permanent faculty at IIM-Ranchi.         
	About 500 applications have been received by IIM-Joka for 14 permanent faculty positions. The process of interviewing will start soon.

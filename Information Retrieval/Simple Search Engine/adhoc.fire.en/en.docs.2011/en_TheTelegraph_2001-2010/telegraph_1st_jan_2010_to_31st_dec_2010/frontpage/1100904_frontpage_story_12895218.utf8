                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Maoists kill different cop
          RAMASHANKAR AND GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Patna, Sept. 3: One of the four policemen abducted by Maoists was found with a bullet hole in his chest this morning, but he wasnt the one the rebels had claimed to have killed yesterday.        
	Lucas Tete, a Bihar Military Police assistant sub-inspector, lay dead near Simra Tari Sringirishi dam, about 150km from Patna and not far from where he and his colleagues had been taken hostage in the forests of Lakhisarai. The policeman from Simdega in Jharkhand was dressed in a vest, a blue shirt and a sarong.         
	Local journalists learnt about the body around 7am, three hours before the expiry of the Maoists latest deadline for a swap of the hostages with eight jailed rebels. Lakhisarai superintendent of police R.K. Mishra announced Tetes death around 10.30am.        
	The announcement snuffed out the hopes of Piyari Tete who had arrived in Patna this morning from Jharkhand with her three daughters, looking to meet chief minister Nitish Kumar and plead with him to get her husband freed.        
	But hope flickered for Rajni Devi, wife of assistant sub-inspector Abhay Kumar Yadav, whom the rebels had yesterday claimed to have murdered after one of their swap deadlines had passed.        
	A Maoist leaflet left beside Tetes body implied that the three other hostages, all abducted after Sundays battle in Lakhisarai that killed seven policemen, were alive.        
	The jamadar has been killed after the expiry of the deadline for the release of my eight colleagues, it said. The three police officers in our custody would be eliminated if our demands are not met.        
	However, the Maoists have not set any fresh deadline for the swap. Self-proclaimed rebel spokesperson Avinash, who had been speaking to news channels till yesterday and had announced Yadavs killing, could not be contacted today.        
	Nitish, under attack from the Opposition for his alleged failure to handle the situation, has convened an all-party meeting in Patna tomorrow. Former chief minister Lalu Prasad has appealed to the Maoists to come forward for talks.        
	Stunned by Tetes killing, the state government, which advocates the development tack to deal with Maoism, appeared to have decided to go all out against the rebels. It launched an intense search for the hostages and an offensive against the guerrillas.        
	There is no question of maintaining restraint after the killing of Lucas Tete in captivity, said additional director-general (headquarters) P.K. Thakur.        
	The state has rushed 200 additional policemen to Lakhisarai and Munger to look for the hostages  Yadav, Rupesh Kumar and Md Ahsan  in the hilly terrain of Jamui, Munger and Banka districts of eastern Bihar.        
	Police headquarters has requisitioned three helicopters and 40 companies of central paramilitary forces for the operation against the Maoists, a senior officer said. He said an air force helicopter had reached the state this afternoon.        
	The decision to intensify operations was taken at a meeting chaired by Nitish. A comprehensive plan is being worked out to launch a joint operation along the Bihar-Jharkhand border to flush out the Maoists, an officer said.        
	The operation was intensified after 2pm, with security teams combing the Dharhaa forests in Munger. Another team raided Laraiyatand and Khaguria villages, considered Maoist strongholds.        
	There had been reports that some Maoists were trapped on the hills, encircled by security forces.        
	A senior CRPF officer, however, said: We have feedback that the second and third-rung leaders, who were mostly from Orissa, Bengal, Chhattisgarh and southern India, have escaped towards Giridih.

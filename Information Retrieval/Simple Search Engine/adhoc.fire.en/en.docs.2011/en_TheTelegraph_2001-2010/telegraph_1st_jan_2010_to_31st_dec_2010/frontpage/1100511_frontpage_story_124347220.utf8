                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Nirupama rsquo;s clothes sent for forensic tests
                                  Nirupama Pathak, alleged victim of quot;honour killing quot;.                                      Ranchi, May 11 (PTI): Nirupama Pathak, the 22year old Delhi based journalist rsquo;s clothes are now sent for forensic studies. After her alleged ldquo;honour killing rdquo; police has seized her clothes from her residence in Jhumri Talaiya. According to police sources, the clothes have been sent to a forensic laboratory in Ranchi, after obtaining the court rsquo;s permission. 
    On the other hand, Priyabhanshu Ranjan, the boyfriend of Nirupama Pathak, will move a writ petition in the Jharkhand High Court today seeking cancellation of FIR against him and demanding a CBI inquiry into her death.
    Advocate Rajeev Kumar had filed a writ petition, on behalf of Priyabhanshu Ranjan, in the Jharkhand High Court yesterday. However, the registry of the High Court returned the petition due to some technical flaw and asked him to file the same today. Kumar said. ldquo;We have filed a writ petition in the high court seeking the cancellation of the FIR against the petitioner and stay on investigation by the state police as the same was faulty and self contradictory rdquo;, said Kumar. He adds ldquo;we have also sought a CBI probe in the death of Nirupama Pathak rdquo;.
    He said the petition has sought to restrain the police from taking any coercive action against Priyabhanshu. The advocate says how can police investigate the matter on the basis of two ldquo;contradictory rdquo; FIRs.
    A stay has been sought on the FIR filed by the police against Priyabhanshu on the charge of cheating, rape and abetment to suicide filed by police on the instructions of a Koderma court. Earlier, the Koderma police had filed a FIR against Nirupama's mother Sudha Pathak, after which she was arrested and charged with her murder.
    Kumar said ldquo;we have also prayed to the court to restrain the police from tempering with the evidence in the case rdquo;. A team of Koderma police had questioned Priyabhanshu and some common friends of him and Nirupama in New Delhi. Earlier the SP Koderma Kranti Kumar had interrogated the family members of the girl.  All India Student's Association (AISA) along with All India Progressive Women's Association (AIPWA) and students and alumni of Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) will hold a protest demonstration before the Jharkhand bhawan tomorrow from 12pm to demand justice for Nirupama.

  - Statement, intercepts suggest injury          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	March 28: A purported Maoist statement and a string of telephone intercepts have lent credence to suspicion that Kishan, the guerrillas military wing chief, has suffered bullet injuries and is in need of emergency medical attention.        
	We will reply to each bullet that hit Kishenji and comrade Bikram, said an email sent to Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik and attributed to the central military commission of the Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army on Saturday. It was not clear whether the Bikram the email referred to is a former Jadavpur University student or a senior Maoist leader who goes by the same name.        
	As soon as you launch the joint special operation or Green Hunt, we will start attacks at Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Puri simultaneously, the email said while threatening to blow up the Orissa chief ministers residence.        
	Speculation about Kishans injury  some police officers said they thought he was dead  has been rife ever since joint forces in Bengal mounted a 12-hour offensive on Thursday within 30km of Lalgarh in West Midnapore. The security forces had then described the offensive as the biggest yet in Bengal.        
	Bengal police believe the 58-year-old Kishan has been trying to sneak into Jharkhand for treatment after being hit by two bullets in the gun battle on Thursday when the security forces alone were said to have fired 2,500 rounds.        
	According to sources, Kishan took part in the encounter on the outskirts of Lalgarh. We havent faced such intense firing in recent times. It was clear that there was a big leader there. We think it was Kishan, said an officer.                    
	Although the police could not find a body in the forest, they were sure of some casualties.         
	While the forces were advancing towards a deserted Lakshmanpur village on Friday afternoon, their telecom wing recorded conversations on bullet injuries to Dada.         
	People in the region are known to address Kishan, who is also a politburo member of the CPI (Maoist), as Dada.         
	Several factors  heightened resistance, the telephone intercepts and local intelligence  make the police believe that the Dada in the conversation was Kishan. He is believed to have been hit in his shoulder and leg.         
	Kishan and his aides, earlier accessible to the media after advance notice of a few hours, were not reachable over the phone. For over a month  since the security forces offensive gained momentum  the Maoists have slipped into the silence mode.         
	The police have apparently learnt from the intercepts that Dada has been moved somewhere in Belpahari, about 20km from the Hatishole forest where the encounter took place, in the past 24 hours.         
	Jharkhand is just a few kilometres from Belpahari and it appears he is trying to sneak into the neighbouring state. Ferrying him in a motorbike will be risky and he cant walk on his own. So, they are taking time, an officer said.         
	Security forces have found empty medical kits near a deserted irrigation department building in a forest adjacent to Lakshmanpur. It is not possible to handle bullet injuries in a forest. We have checked all nursing homes and health centres in the region. Crossing over to Jharkhand seems to be his only option, the officer said.         
	The forces have fanned out to prevent Kishan from crossing the metalled road between Belpahari and Banspahari on his way to the Jharkhand forests, he added.

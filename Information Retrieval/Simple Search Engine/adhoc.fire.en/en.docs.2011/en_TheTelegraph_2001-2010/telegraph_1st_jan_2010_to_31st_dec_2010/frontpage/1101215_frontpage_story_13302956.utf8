The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Core ministries on shuffle casualty list

          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is said to be dissatisfied with the performance of infrastructure-related ministries and would like to bring more efficient ministers in these departments in the cabinet recast expected after the Congress plenary.        
	Although the performance of a few other ministers are also less than satisfactory, sources in the government said the Prime Ministers concern about infrastructure-related ministries was higher as they are supposed to be the engines of economic growth.        
	 There is a feeling among the key players of the government that corrective steps should be taken before it is too late, a senior minister told The Telegraph.         
	While power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and surface transport minister Kamal Nath appear to be in trouble, the fate of steel minister Virbhadra Singh also hangs in balance. Sources said Shindes failure to reform the power ministry has been a worry for a long time and the issue had cropped up at cabinet meetings on several occasions in the recent past.        
	The displeasure with Kamal Nath, however, goes beyond his ministerial performance and there are hints about his decline in the party, too. Virbhadra Singh, too, has created a poor impression, and the sources said his ouster from the steel ministry was almost certain.        
	The other cabinet ministers in the doubtful category are minister of heavy industries Vilasrao Deshmukh and minister of state for coal Sriprakash Jaiswal. The sources said the Prime Minister would like to inject a sense of urgency and dynamism in these ministries.        
	Although making such drastic changes in the government that would affect many Congress stalwarts would have been difficult under normal circumstances, the sudden image crisis caused by the Opposition offensive on corruption may eventually make the overhaul much easier.        
	According to the sources, both Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi feel the urgent need for an image makeover and would like to tone up the system for delivering on the promises.        
	There is a possibility of some ministers going back to the organisation as Sonia is serious about implementing the one-man-one-post rule this time. The poor political management on the party front, too, has highlighted the need for a stronger AICC team and senior leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad or Ambika Soni may be drafted for party work as general secretary.        
	Soni, now information and broadcasting minister, was herself not very keen to join the government but internal political dynamics eased her out of Sonias team. Soni is said to have adequately repaired her relations with Sonia and her political secretary Ahmed Patel and is set to rejoin the core team.        
	Sonia is planning to include many younger leaders  mostly from Rahuls team  in the AICC set-up as secretaries.         
	These changes were earlier supposed to have taken place before the three-day Congress plenary from December 18. Sonia may now declare her new team only in the new year, probably in the auspicious period that dawns after makarsankranti on January 14. The cabinet shuffle is also expected to be carried out around the same time.

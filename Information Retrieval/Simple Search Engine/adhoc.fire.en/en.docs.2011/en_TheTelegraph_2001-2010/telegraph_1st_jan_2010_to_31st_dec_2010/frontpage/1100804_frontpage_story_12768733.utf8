          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Ranchi, Aug. 3: The Election Commission today directed Jharkhand to file an FIR regarding a television expos alleging bribing of MLAs to vote in a particular way in the recent Rajya Sabha elections.        
	The commission discussed today the said news report in all its ramification and directed that the Jharkhand administration lodge necessary FIR under relevant provisions of the law in the matter, an EC release issued in New Delhi said.        
	A TV channel had shown a few Jharkhand MLAs as saying that on payment  amounts ranging from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 2 crore  they could get their colleagues first and second preference votes in the manner desired by the payer.        
	This amounted to offence of bribery at an election under Section 171-B of the IPC, the EC release said. It also amounted to an offence under Sections 8 and 9 of Prevention of Corruption Act, it added.        
	These offences carry prison terms that vary between 6 months to five years.         
	In Ranchi, in a quick move to distance itself from alleged wrongdoing, the state BJP, and the Congress and its ally JVM, promptly served showcause notices to some of their MLAs named in the sting.        
	On the instructions of state party chief Raghubar Das, a showcause notice was today served on Uma Shanker Yadav Akela asking him to explain his position within seven days, in the light of the TV channel expos, BJP spokesman Sanjay Seth said.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Strum away the blues, no strings attached 
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                            Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Sarod maestro                                  
	Calcutta, March 23: Welcome to Asim Dasguptas Sonar  as in sound waves  Bangla where you can listen to Bach after lunch, Beethoven in the evening and Tchaikovsky when depressed.        
	The finance minister, known to pick a Mozart when in the mood, today struck a chord with musicians and music makers with something as non-sonorous as the state budget.        
	Dasgupta waived the four per cent value-added tax on musical strings, with one eye on the needs of small traders and businessmen and another on his singer wife.        
	I cannot sing but my wife (Shyamali) is a classical Rabindrasangeet singer and she sings well. Im sure she will be happy on learning of this proposal, Dasgupta told The Telegraph over the phone, on returning to his Salt Lake home after a long budget day. (No, there wasnt Tchaikovsky playing in the background, although earlier in the day the Opposition had cried itself hoarse in the Assembly.)        
	I am very fond of western classical music and listen to it regularly, Dasgupta added. Music is a great healer. After lunch, you should listen to Bach. In the evenings, one should go for Beethoven. And if you are depressed, try listening to Tchaikovsky. I am very fond of their creations.        
	So was it his love for these composers or his admiration for his wifes vocal chords that had prompted the finance minister to spare a thought for musical strings in his budget?         
	I think as finance minister I have the responsibility of addressing the needs of small traders and businessmen. Particularly when anything related to music is concerned. In the last budget, I had given a tax exemption to musical instruments.        
	This year, it was the turn of musical strings. This is a good move that is sure to boost our business, said Tapan Sen, younger son of the late Hemen Chandra Sen, founder of the now-legendary Hemen amp; Co. on Rashbehari Avenue.        
	Sens sarods for the masters like Amjad Ali Khan are made of the finest Burma teak and use strings from German makers Roslau. The cost of the sarod is around Rs 60,000 and that of the string about Rs 600.         
	The slash is not substantial, but sends out a positive signal, feel makers of the sarod and guitar alike.        
	Peter Remedios, the chairman of the 101-year-old J. Reynolds amp; Co. on Mirza Ghalib Street, said that in a meeting earlier this year, the proposal to bring down the VAT on all musical instruments was placed before state representatives.         
	Singer Durga Jasraj and sitar player Purbayan Chatterjee were among the artistes present at the meeting, convened by the Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry, or Assocham, which acts as an umbrella body for professionals in the music industry, from artistes to instrument makers.        
	A lot of younger musicians struggling to buy proper instruments will also benefit from this, said Purbayan.        
	Amyt Datta, guitarist with the bands Pink Noise and Skinny Alley, agreed: A small gesture like this could eventually mean a lot.                    WITH INPUTS FROM ARKA DAS AND MOHUA DAS

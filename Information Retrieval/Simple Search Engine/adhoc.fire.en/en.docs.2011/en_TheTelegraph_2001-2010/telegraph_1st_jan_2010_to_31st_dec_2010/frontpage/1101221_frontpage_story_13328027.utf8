  - Guess how Mamata pulled a sweet one on Leander          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Leander Paes with Mamata Banerjee on Monday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                      
	Calcutta, Dec. 20: Multiple Grand Slam-winner Leander Paes wanted to surprise Mamata Banerjee with a Nahoums Christmas cake. As it turned out, the railway minister and Trinamul chairperson wanted to surprise him in exactly the same manner!        
	She did.        
	Arre, even youve bought me a cake from Nahoums, jaa... Just goes to show we were thinking alike, a smiling Mamata told Leander, who gave the impression that hed been served an ace by a lady who may soon become chief minister.        
	It was to have been a 15-minute courtesy call at the Trinamuls Topsia office this evening but Leander spent over three-quarters of an hour and almost missed his flight back to Mumbai.        
	Clearly, the affection shown by Mamata made it difficult for Leander to make a quick getaway.        
	Ive known Leander from the time he was a small boy... Actually, Ive known the Paes family for long, Mamata said.                                      
	Didi has always been very supportive and, as a Union minister in the 1980s, had helped whenever Dad (Dr Vece Paes) approached her to get clearances, Leander pointed out.         
	As Leander accepted tea and rusk, Mamata (clad in her trademark cotton sari and hawai chappals) said: Youve become very slim, why? It was time for the tennis star to unleash a winner  Didi, Im now into films, too.        
	Leander continued: Im already shooting in Mumbai and theres an offer from Hollywood as well.... Ill personally invite you for the premiere of my first film.        
	Mamata insisted a personal invitation wouldnt be necessary.        
	Asked by The Telegraph if she had favourites in the world of cinema, Mamata replied: I know a lot of people, both in Bollywood and Tollywood.... Recently, I inaugurated the international film festival in Goa.... But no, I wont pick favourites....        
	Laughing, Mamata quickly added: Actually, Leander will become my favourite hero. The hero-in-the-making blushed.        
	Talking about sport, Mamata emphasised that she admired and saluted winners. Look at Sachin (Tendulkar), hes the golden boy of Indian sport.... Ive been a huge supporter of Sachin and one doesnt have to be parochial.        
	When it was mayor Sovan Chatterjees turn to be introduced to Leander, Mamata described him as another golden boyof Indian sport, whod done Bengal and Calcutta so proud.        
	Indeed, besides a dozen Grand Slam titles in doubles and mixed doubles, Leander brought home a bronze from the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.        
	Trinamul vice-president and spokesperson Derek Brien, whod co-ordinated Leanders visit, chipped in to say that hed once thrashed him in tennis.        
	That didnt impress Mamata. No, no.... It must have been a got-up game!        
	That lightened the mood further.        
	Within a few minutes, though, tension became palpable as word spread that a Trinamul student leader, Sanju Malakar, had been shot at twice.        
	Every day, so many lives are being lost. I know were supporting the central government, but the Centre isnt doing anything, Mamata stated, somewhat agitatedly.        
	Turning to MLA Madan Mitra, Mamata then said: Oke (Malakar) bachao. That has to be our priority.        
	With more politicians coming into the chairpersons room, it was time for Leander to take leave. Mamata blessed him and suggested that he start an academy in the city.        
	Ill give whatever help is needed.... After all, youve done so much for sport, was Mamatas assurance.         
	Leander, for his part, indicated hed begin to put plans in place after the London Olympics (2012).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Chinese radar runs into rough weather
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Chinese radar runs into rough weather

	Paradip, Oct. 31: The Made-in-China label has put a question mark on a Doppler radar station proposed to be set up at Paradip.        
	The radar will help generate accurate weather data, especially advance information about cyclones, storms and cloudbursts. It was scheduled to have become operational from November but the defence ministry is reported to have objected to its Chinese make on security grounds. The ministry has sought its replacement with an indigenously manufactured radar.         
	An official of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said: We have been asked not to install the China-made radar till further orders.        
	Construction work for the radar station is on in full swing. Earlier, it had been decided to install the Doppler radar by December 2010. But we have been asked to wait for sometime as the radar here would be put through scientific tests, said G.V. Prasad, chief of the Paradip meteorology station.         
	However, sources said the radar project had been grounded following objections raised by defence officials on security grounds. Since the radar meant for the Paradip meteorology wing is manufactured in China, security concerns are being raised. It is feared that the in-built chips in the radar might help pass on information to the manufacturing country.        
	As far as I know, the Paradip Doppler radar station is awaiting clearance from the ministry of defence and the ministry of science and technology. We are expecting clearance shortly, Prasad told The Telegraph. However, no formal information in this regard has been received.         
	The IMD radar station at Mumbai had also faced defence-related problems as the Doppler radar was made in China. But we dont know whether the delay in the installation of the radar at Paradip is for the same reason, Prasad said.        
	The Doppler radar station would be of use to the natural calamity-prone Orissa coast as it would make accurate forecasts about the changing weather patterns, cyclones, storms and cloudbursts, said the Paradip meteorology station chief.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | SPAIN ATTAIN   Late justice as Iniesta foils Dutch kickers and cloggers
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                SPAIN ATTAIN           Late justice as Iniesta foils Dutch kickers and cloggers                                          
	Justice left it very, very late but finally had the overdue and utterly deserved last word as Spain added the World Cup  remarkably, their first  to the European title.        
	Not until four minutes from the end of extra time and the fearful threat of a penalty shootout did Andres Iniesta strike down a Dutch team who, with their clumping, kicking and clogging, did not even deserve to be in the 2010 final.         
	Bert van Marwijks team turned football tradition on its head as the inheritors of the tradition of pure, free-flowing total football showed merely envious nastiness.         
	The Netherlands might claim their strategy was justified since they fashioned the two clearest, easiest chances of normal time in the all-European 2010 showdown.         
	They could have been painting Johannesburg orange through the night.        
	Instead, Arjen Robben, to Spains relief, was foiled on both occasions deep in the second half by keeper-captain Iker Casillas.        
	For those stops, Casillas deserves the world games thanks for averting a totally wrong-headed outcome from concluding the most controversial staging of the World Cup since Argentina  for totally different reasons  in 1978.

	South Africa, supported by Fifa president Sepp Blatter, had campaigned initially to win host rights in 2006 but was outmanoeuvred politically by Germany.         
	Fifa, at Blatters behest, then introduced a system of rotation which designated 2010 for Africa and made it inevitable that South Africa would win at second attempt.        
	Nelson Mandela, against doctors advice, made the journey to Zurich to lay his hands on the World Cup ahead of its journey. He was back, having missed the opening match through family bereavement, to greet the Soccer City crowd during the closing ceremonials before kick-off.        
	The ceremony also featured Shakira projecting the official song which had thumped around South Africa for a month.         
	It will take far, far longer before any conclusion can safely be reached about the cultural, political and social benefits of this experience.         
	At least the spectre of negativity proclaimed abroad about South Africas hosting capacity has been exorcised and the 3-million-plus ticket sales have topped that in Germany in 2006 despite a slow initial local take-up.   
	Just a pity the two teams in the final could not rise to the challenge in similar fashion.         
	The early exits of France, Italy and England had prompted premature obituaries for European football.         
	Instead, the twists and turns of fate turned up not only the eighth all-European final but the certainty of a new (European) name on the World Cup itself.         
	But Spain made desperately hard work of it.         
	Dutch football, through its coaches and players  Johan Cruyff most notably, in both roles  had played a singular role in the evolution of the Spanish game.        
	Indeed, in a role reversal, Dutch coach Van Marwijk had long proclaimed an admiration for Barcelona and a wish that his team could mimic them.         
	This was his  and their  moment of truth and they betrayed their own heritage.        
	Spain played all of the football that there was and exerted much of the pressure. But they had only two clear chances in normal time, both through attacking fullback Sergio Ramos.        
	Early in the first half, he was denied by a fine save from Maarten Stekelenburg; midway through the second, he misdirected a free header horribly high over the bar.         
	The Netherlands, battling aggressively to break up Spains rhythm, had a sequential stream of players booked by English referee Howard Webb.         
	In the Premier League, he would have produced a red card before the 90 minutes were up.         
	If he had done so  particularly to Mark van Bommel for one awful tackle from behind  he might have done Spain, himself, the World Cup Final and football in general a favour.        
	Finally, as justice would have it again, it was the policemans unarguable expulsion of John Heitinga that came just in time to thin out the Dutch defence and save us all from shootout hell.         
	Thus justice was done  thanks, in part, to a British Bobby.

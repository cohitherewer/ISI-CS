The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Prime time relief for Bigg Boss
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Prime time relief for Bigg Boss
          SADAF MODAK                            Pamela Anderson who made a guest appearance in Bigg Boss                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 27: Bigg relief, eh!        
	You could also call it prime-time reprieve.        
	Bombay High Court today allowed Bigg Boss to be telecast at 9pm, the prime-time slot it has enjoyed since the reality show went on air on October 3.        
	The order, five weeks after the court stayed an information and broadcasting ministry directive to reschedule the telecast to a late-night, 11pm-to-5am slot, means the show will be aired on prime time till its scheduled January 7 grand finale.        
	Theres a condition, though: Colors, the channel that beams the Salman Khan-hosted show, will have to censor content.        
	The vacation bench of Justices S.J. Kathawala and U.D. Salvi said the show could be allowed to continue on prime time as the channel had given an undertaking that it would not broadcast any objectionable content.        
	In November, a government committee had concluded, apparently based on complaints from viewers, that Bigg Boss 4, which also featured Baywatch babe Pamela Anderson, was unfit to be watched by children.         
	The I amp;B ministry served a notice on the channel directing it to reschedule the show to after 11. In its directive, the ministry said the show offended good taste and decency.        
	On November 18, the court stayed the directive.        
	Three weeks later, on December 8, the court directed the ministry to issue a fresh showcause notice to the channel and specify the contents it found objectionable. The ministry then specified objectionable content in eight episodes.        
	On Saturday, Viacom 18, which owns Colours, approached the court after the I amp;B ministry again directed it to shift the show timings from 9pm to 11pm.        
	Ram Jethmalani and Ameet Naik, the lawyers for Viacom 18, argued that the channel had not aired any such episodes after it received the directive.        
	The court today asked the channel not to re-telecast these episodes, or share them with news channels.        
	A source in Viacom said the company had not yet received the final copy of the order. So we dont know whether the court has ordered not to re-telecast any episode or just those eight.

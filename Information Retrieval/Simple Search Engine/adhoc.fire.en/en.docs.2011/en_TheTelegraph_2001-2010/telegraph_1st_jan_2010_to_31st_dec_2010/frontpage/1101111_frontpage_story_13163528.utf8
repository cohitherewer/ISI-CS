	Bokaro, Nov. 10: Shibu Sorens daughter, Anjali Sorens tryst with politics ended prematurely as her nomination papers for contesting panchayat elections has been rejected.        
	Anjali, sister of deputy chief minister Hemant Soren, was to contest for district board (zilla parishad) from Jaridih block of Bokaro district. But, Bokaro additional collector and election officer Anugrah Narain Pathak rejected her papers on two counts.        
	First, Anjalis name was missing from the Jaridih voters list as on September 15, the cut-off fixed by the election commission for prospective candidates. Secondly, her proposers address was incorrect as he mentioned a wrong panchayat.        
	Additional collector Anugrah Pathak confirmed the rejection of the nomination papers filed by Anjali, whose husband is a senior officer working for Bokaro Steel plant.

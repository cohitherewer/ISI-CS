The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Biharis want a bright future
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Biharis want a bright future
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                      
	A crackerburst rang out as soon as I sat down for this interview. Stop that, stop that immediately, Nitish Kumar instructed an aide. That sort of thing shouldnt happen here. Even in his moment of triumph he was his own distinct self. He was barely even ready to flash a V sign, he had to be coaxed into it. Already, he was disengaging from the celebrations and talking of the huge responsibilities.         
	Excerpts from the conversation:        
	Q: Is this the arrival of the Nitish Kumar cult?        
	A: Where is the cult? There is no cult.         
	Q: But the moment?        
	A: But yes, this is a huge moment, a historic victory for the people of Bihar. They have risen above caste and defied the stereotypes of Biharis. They too want a bright future. This is not my victory, this is the victory of Biharis.         
	Q: Did you even expect it?        
	A: I did and I told you that a few months ago. But many did not see the ground-shift either because they could not sense it or because they did not want to sense it. It frightened them that the easy politics of caste would not work any more. They had no alternative to offer to the people. The more I travelled the more I realised that things had changed radically. That a new Bihar has emerged.         
	Q: Your priorities now?        
	A: Essentially, to continue the work we have been doing. Governance is a 24/7 thing, it must go on and governance is not about occupying office, it is a whole spectrum of things.        
	Q: Specifically?        
	A: An anti-corruption law  a zero-tolerance legislation. I want to empower the state to seize the personal properties and assets of those found guilty of corruption. That signal needs to go out strongly. We have seen caste arithmetic being neutralised, we want to deal strongly with corruption.        
	Q: Anything else?        
	A: Power. Bihar has suffered badly for the lack of power.        
	Q: Whats happening on the power front?        
	A: We should become power sufficient and even power surplus in the next few years. We have ongoing projects both in the public and private sectors. Those that are with us, we are already working on, like enhancing the generation capacity from Barauni and Kanti, and of course the newer projects in Nabinagar and Fatuha. I can only say we are working on it and are very keen on quick delivery.                    
	Q: How do you expect to attract investment?        
	A: Money began to come in a while ago, but with this election more people will be assured that investments in Bihar are safe.        
	 Q: BJP has made greater gains than you. Does that worry you?         
	A: Look, I do not look at it the way you do. This is the victory of a combine. We are in an alliance that has run very smoothly for more than a decade. I do not want to speculate on who has got more and who less, this is the NDAs victory and the NDA in Bihar will continue to run as it has. I leave the rest of the speculation and analysing to the media to do.        
	Q: After Bihar? There is also talk already of you being a prime ministerial prospect in 2014        
	A: (laughs) Kaahe ko? (Why?) I have been mandated to serve the people of Bihar and that is what I want to do. I do not want to look left or right. I want to focus on my given task. I have not thought of myself as a prime ministerial candidate and to tell you frankly, I do not even consider myself qualified enough for the job.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, June 2: Two unidentified criminals, who were allegedly on a mission to kill, were gunned down by the police inside an apartment complex at Hinoo in Doranda police station area this evening.        
	Senior superintendent of police Praveen Kumar, who reached the spot soon after the incident took place around 8pm, said the two belonged to the Bhola Pandey gang. The two were acting on the orders of Kishore Pandey, who has been running the gang after Bhola Pandeys death, to kill one Satish Srivastava.         
	The criminals came on a brand new bike which had no number plate. After confirming from the guards that their target indeed lived in the apartment, they moved in. Once they identified Satish, they fired at him, said Kumar.         
	Satish, a businessman, is the brother of criminal Sushil Srivastava, who is now lodged in Hazaribagh jail. Satish lives in the four-storey Saroj Apartment with his family.         
	Senior superintendent of police Kumar said the police had prior information about the possible attack on Satish and his family members by the criminals, and some plainclothes policemen had been deployed near Satishs residence.         
	As they fired at me, I ducked and saved myself. I ran inside my house and locked the door from inside, said Satish.        
	As soon as the shots rang out, the plainclothes men who were in the vicinity, swung into action and opened fire. In the encounter that followed, the two criminals were killed.         
	The SSP said though the criminals were yet to be identified, one appeared to be from the state capital, and the other from somewhere else.

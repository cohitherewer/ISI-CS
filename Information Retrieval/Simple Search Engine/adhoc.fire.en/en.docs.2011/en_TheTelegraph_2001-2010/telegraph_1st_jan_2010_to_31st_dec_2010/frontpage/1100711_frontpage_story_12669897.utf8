The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Final call: style or safety   The tactics of the teams for Super Sunday
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Final call: style or safety     The tactics of the teams for Super Sunday
          
	Some of the biggest names in world football will grace Sundays World Cup final, but will Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie turn on the style or be shackled by a safety-first desire to bring the title home for the first time?        
	Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk said his team has buried the happy-go-lucky style of play that thrilled fans for 40 years.        
	Instead of the free-flowing moves of Johan Cruyff, theres tight discipline, an emphasis on possession  and careful build-up from the back. The tactics have brought criticism, but also results: the Dutch unbeaten streak is now up to 25 games, including 10 straight wins.        
	The same could be said to some extent for Spain. The team has yet to truly light up the World Cup, losing to Switzerland and struggling to get past lesser teams. But the European champions seem more driven by a collective desire to win rather than shine individually.        
	Heres a look at both teams, and the tactics they may adopt on Sunday at Soccer City:        
	The Netherlands defence        
	The Netherlands plays a flat back four in front of tall Ajax goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. Stekelenburgs one-handed save against Kaka in the quarterfinal win over Brazil is one of the best of the tournament, but his blunder on Diego Forlans equaliser in the semifinals also stands out.        
	In front of him, John Heitinga and Joris Mathijsen are expected to play in the centre on Sunday. Heitingas pace and tackling complement the strength and aerial prowess of Mathijsen. Captain Giovanni van Bronckhorst will be at left back and 22-year-old Gregory van der Wiel on the right. Both know how to make probing runs on the wings.        
	Considered the biggest liability coming into the World Cup, the backline has proven to be a sound foundation, if not impregnable.        
	Van Marwijk, however, counts on everyone to contribute. Even the forwards.        
	Midfield        
	Van Marwijk will field defensive midfielders Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong to reinforce the defence.        
	Van Bommel has had a sterling season with Bayern Munich and has used the same mix of grit and intimidation to lead the team. De Jong is stockier, a tireless tackler whose job is to break up opposition attacks.        
	Their work gives both Robben and Dirk Kuyt freedom on the flanks.        
	Kuyts work rate stands out and contrasts with Robbens flashes of brilliance as he cuts inside from the right, passes defenders and shoots from long range.        
	Attack        
	Van Persie recovered from an ankle injury that had blighted his club season just in time to lead the Netherlands attack at the World Cup. He has stuttered in South Africa with just one goal in six appearances. Playmaker Wesley Sneijder has glossed over that deficiency by scoring five goals from his deeper position. It turned him into the star of the team and he is joint leader of the scoring chart with five goals.        
	Spain defence        
	Barcelona centre back Carles Puyol is a rugged fighter, but also a threat at set-pieces. It was his powerful header from a corner that put Spain into the final, and he marshals a backline of goalkeeper Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Barcelona team-mate Gerard Pique and Joan Capdevilla. The defence soaked up Germanys attacks and rarely looked threatened and gives the team a solid backbone.        
	They have the collective ability to neutralise individual threats, as they did with Cristiano Ronaldo in the second-round match with Portugal. Theyre likely to adopt the same tactics against Sneijder.        
	Midfield        
	Iniesta and Xavi have what seems to be a telepathic understanding and can wear teams down with their intricate passing patterns. When on form, frustrated opponents are forced to chase the game and often struggle to get hold of the ball. They can suddenly switch gear and probe opposition defences in the safe knowledge that midfielder Xabi Alonso is behind them, breaking up opposition attacks and launching Spanish moves from deep.         
	Attack        
	David Villa is joint top scorer with Sneijder with five goals.         
	The Barcelona-bound striker is a classic poacher but has proved lethal from distance, too, scoring an opportunistic goal from 45 metres against Chile in the group stage.         
	Fernando Torres has had a disappointing tournament. Yet when on form, Torres is among the best in the world and he scored the only goal in the 2008 European Championship final against Germany.        
	Whether to play Torres or Pedro Rodriguez, who played in the semifinals and at times tormented the German defenders with his quick dribbling and pace, is probably the major tactical decision Del Bosque must take.

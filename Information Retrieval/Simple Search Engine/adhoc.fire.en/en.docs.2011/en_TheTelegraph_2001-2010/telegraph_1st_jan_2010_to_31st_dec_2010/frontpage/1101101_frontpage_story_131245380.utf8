	New Delhi, Nov 1 (PTI): Congress President Sonia Gandhi today held consultations with senior party leaders on the fate of Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan who has been embroiled in a upscale housing society scam in Mumbai.
    Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Defence Minister A K Antony and senior party leader Ahmed Patel met Gandhi here and are understood to have discussed the matter.
    The meeting took place even as the embattled Chief Minister left for Mumbai early this morning.
    Talk in the political circles was that Chavan had stayed put in the capital to meet Mukherjee who returned here late last evening from West Bengal.
    Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh, whose ministry's clearance was also an issue in the matter, also joined the meeting. The parleys come a day ahead of the AICC meeting here.

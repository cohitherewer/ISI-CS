          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 5: Calcutta High Court today rejected Aftab Ansaris appeal against his death sentence in the American Center attack case, but set free two of his co-convicts and reduced the punishment to a five-year term for three others.         
	Apart from Aftab, aide Jamiluddin Nasser missed the mercy bus with the two-judge bench upholding the death sentence against him on grounds of equal participation in the attack.        
	Five policemen were killed and 16 people injured in the January 2002 morning raid.        
	The two convicts to walk out of jail free after spending more than four years on death row are Adil Hasan and Rehan Alam.         
	This bench is acquitting Adil Hasan and Rehan Alam of all the charges for want of evidence, said the verdict.        
	Hasrat Alam, Musharat Hossain and Shakil Ahmed are also technically eligible for instant freedom, having served eight years, more than the reduced sentence of five years.         
	Advocate Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee, the counsel for the trio, however, said his clients would have to wait at least another week to walk out of jail.         
	The bench wrapped up the proceedings by staying the execution of the death sentence against Aftab and Jamiluddin for three months. The duo are allowed to move Supreme Court in the meantime.        
	The review verdict seemed to have pleased neither the prosecution nor the defence. Shahid Imam, the counsel for Aftab and Jamiluddin, said: The prosecution could not prove that my clients were involved in the incident.        
	Public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami said he was unhappy about three of the convicts getting a lighter sentence.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 19: The Reserve Bank today raised two benchmark interest rates  the repo and the reverse repo  by 25 basis points each to 5 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively in a signal of monetary tightening as it struggles to tamp down on inflation.        
	Inflation is hovering at 9.89 per cent but is expected to go up to double digits later this month.        
	With money sloshing about in the financial system, the reverse repo has emerged as a key rate-signalling device for the banking industry.        
	The reverse repo is the rate at which the central bank soaks up excess cash from the system against government securities, or gilts.         
	The repo is the rate at which the RBI gives out money to banks in exchange for gilts.        
	This is the first interest rate hike by the central bank since October 2008 when it started slashing interest rates to quell the withering effects of a global recession.        
	Bankers, however, said the increase would not trigger a surge in lending rates  at least not immediately. Most banks raised their home and vehicle loan rates recently.

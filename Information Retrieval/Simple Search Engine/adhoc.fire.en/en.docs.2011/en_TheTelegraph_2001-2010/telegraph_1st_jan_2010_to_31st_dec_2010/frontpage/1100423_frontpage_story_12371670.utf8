          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                    
	April 22: Expect changes with a change at the top in the Indian Premier League (IPL).        
	According to key sources of The Telegraph, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) intends moving towards empowering the state associations concerned to fully conduct IPL matches.        
	Then, and this will hurt the swish set, the BCCI wants to do away with the after-match parties, which have come in for criticism from many quarters.        
	The BCCI has already played a big role in the successful hosting of two World Cups (1987, 1996) and is about to jointly stage another (2011). Arent our affiliates capable of hosting a handful of T20 matches? asked one key source.        
	Right now, the IPL is managed by the International Management Group (IMG), which gets a hefty fee (Rs 27 crore this season) from the BCCI.        
	The staging associations are given Rs 50 lakh for every match.        
	Another key source said: The after-match parties dont have to be a part of the IPL package and should be delinked. The feedback hasnt all been favourable and we dont want the tournament, an excellent property, to get a bad name because of the behaviour of a few whore out largely to seek cheap publicity.        
	The changes will, of course, be effective from the post-Lalit Modi era.         
	Even as government agencies are turning up the heat on the IPL chairman and commissioner, the BCCI is in overdrive for Monday.        
	That, indeed, has become the most important day as the IPLs governing council meeting is scheduled that morning.        
	If the embattled Modi does stay away, on the ground that its unauthorised, the members will elect the chairman for that meeting.        
	Indications are that the no-nonsense BCCI president, Shashank Manohar, would be given that responsibility.        
	Unless Modi steps down, its expected that the governing council will move a motion of no-confidence against him. That will be communicated to the BCCIs working committee and, on ratification, a special general meeting called.        
	At that stage, a three-fourths majority will be required to end Modis controversial innings. If anything, his position looks to be getting weaker by the day.         
	Manohar wasnt available for a confirmation, but one learns that the franchises are going to be told that they have no business handing out certificates to Modi.        
	Royal Challengers Bangalore owner Vijay Mallya and Shilpa Shetty, co-owner of the Rajasthan Royals, have gone on TV to praise the under-acute-fire IPL chairman and commissioner.        
	Modis quite good at this game.... Hed been up to tricks even when the BCCI had a problem with IMG over their fees. Trying to create pressure through the media just isnt going to help him, one of the key sources pointed out.        
	Because of the mess, nobody is going on record, but the talk is that Modi would invariably present the governing council with a fait accompli.        
	Specifically, hed enter into contracts and, then, move the governing council (which has 13 other members) for ratification. Apparently, some governing council members would get intimidated.        
	Whatever, in a remarkably candid interview in New Delhi, former India captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, one of three cricketers on the governing council, admitted it had been a failure.        
	We should have been more aware of what was happening. We should have been doing the questioning, but we didnt, because everything seemed okay. We were all carried away by how well he (Modi) was doing, Pataudi said.        
	Asked if Modi should put in his papers, Pataudi replied: Yes, I think so.        
	Significantly, its understood that the BCCI isnt initiating an internal probe into Modis deals  at least, not yet  as there are international ramifications and it lacks the instruments to investigate.         
	The BCCI, therefore, is waiting for the government to complete its inquiries.

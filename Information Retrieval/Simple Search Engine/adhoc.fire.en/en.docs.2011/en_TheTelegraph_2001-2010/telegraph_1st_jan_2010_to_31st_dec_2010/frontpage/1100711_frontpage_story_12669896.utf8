The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Anti-terror thrust faces Valley threat
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Anti-terror thrust faces Valley threat
  - Delhi fears Pakistan will use unrest as a stalling excuse          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                                          Krishna and Qureshi      
	New Delhi, July 10: The foreign office is bracing for a frontal  and, in its view, disruptive  Pakistani manoeuvre on human rights in Kashmir when external affairs minister S.M. Krishna meets counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi in Islamabad on July 15 to continue the recently resumed dialogue.        
	Late last month, foreign secretaries Nirupama Rao and Salman Bashir had concluded constructive talks on the promise that the mid-July meeting could yield tactile confidence-building measures.        
	Over the past two weeks, though, that optimism has come under the familiar dark shadow of Kashmir. Or, as many in the Indian establishment suspect, its a shadow that has been deliberately resurrected by elements inimical to peace in Pakistan.        
	The current flare-up in the Valley, sections of the foreign office and the home ministry strongly believe, is designed to enable the Pakistani side to place a flaming counter-argument to terror on the bilateral table.        
	It is clear from recent phone intercepts, and from noises emanating from Pakistan, that the effort is to foreground Kashmir at the expense of terror issues which are our real concern, a source in the ministry of external affairs (MEA) told The Telegraph on Saturday, adding: We would consider such a move a deliberate diversionary effort to shift the focus. We are trying to pick up the threads of a broken dialogue; such tactics will not be helpful.        
	New Delhis response to any Pakistani hectoring on Kashmir will be stock and preclusive: Kashmir is an internal matter and a democratically elected government is seized of the situation; flagging human rights in Kashmir is tantamount to interference in Indias domestic matters.                                
	But the MEA knows better than most that verbal fencing wont make a credible enough bulwark against Pakistani concerns on Kashmir, especially since India is committed to discussing all issues, including Kashmir, even though it will not countenance any compromise on Kashmirs absolute integration.        
	New Delhis argument is likely to be that whats unfolding in the Valley is a local problem, none of Pakistans business it is unconnected to the larger and long-term discussion on a political resolution to the Kashmir dispute.        
	Our unresolved grievances on the Mumbai attack and the demand to dismantle the terror machine that functions from Pakistani soil are far more urgent matters because, as we keep saying, they constitute a daily threat to India, an MEA source said.        
	The MEA sources readily concede, though, that Islamabad is all geared up to confront Krishna with the Kashmir issue upon his arrival for talks. They have discerned what they call a clear pattern between events in the Valley and the pitched-up rhetoric on the Pakistani side over the last fortnight.        
	Qureshi has raised the brutal trampling of human rights in Kashmir in almost every public statement and said it would be his priority item in talks with Krishna.                     
	And as phone intercepts --- allegedly between Kashmiri separatist actors seeking escalation of violence --- filtered through, Syed Salahuddin, the Pakistan-based leader of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen, the strongest home-grown insurgent group, was allowed to mount a stage near Islamabad and renew his call for a liberation jehad in Kashmir.        
	These are all concerted events, an MEA source said. It is lost on nobody that Pakistan controls the faucet and keeps opening and squeezing the tap according to what suits its interests; at the moment, clearly, they are letting it flow in Kashmir. They talk about resolving the Kashmir issue, but they are the chief problem there.        
	Fresh moves are afoot, both in New Delhi and Srinagar, to re-open channels with moderate separatist leaders like Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, if only as a means to defusing a stand-off that necessitated a call to the army for the first time in close to two decades.        
	It is unlikely that the Mirwaiz, or any other Hurriyat leader, will respond to the governments back-channel effort in the thick of volatility. But if and when communications are established, New Delhi is firm about keeping Pakistan out.        
	Dialogue with the Hurriyat or other Kashmiri political forces is strictly an internal affair and there is no question of involving Pakistan, a source emphasised.        
	The Mirwaiz and other Hurriyat leaders have been demanding tripartite talks that include Pakistan as one of the preconditions to lending New Delhi an ear.        
	We have to be realistic, the Mirwaiz had told The Telegraph last month. No resolution of the Kashmir dispute can happen without involving Pakistan. We are not saying sit on the same table at the same time, but Pakistan must be involved with the Kashmiri people if India wants to solve this problem.        
	In Kashmir itself, both chief minister Omar Abdullah and Opposition leader Mehbooba Mufti of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have suggested broadening talks with political forces in the Valley (this essentially means the Hurriyat parties) but at the moment it is not even clear whether Omar and Mehbooba are ready to sit on the same table.        
	The chief minister has called an all-party meet in Srinagar on Monday ---- minus the separatist groups ---- but the PDP today refused to be part of it.

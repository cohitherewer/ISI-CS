	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Delhi authorities today announced a massive mosquito-killing exercise along a 2km stretch of the Yamuna to reduce the risk of dengue in the Commonwealth Games Village complex.         
	The state government said it would deploy over 400 workers, some of them drawn from the National Disaster Response Force, to spray pesticides in the water bodies girdling the Games Village.         
	The anti-mosquito squad workers will also release larvae-eating fish into the water bodies.         
	The government has so far registered about 1,600 cases of dengue this year, and four patients have died. But health officials say the infection is largely mild with a 150: 1 ratio of mild-to-severe cases.         
	The waterlogged areas around the Games Village have triggered concern about the possible outbreak of dengue  or other mosquito-borne infections  among the participants.         
	But the health ministry today claimed mosquito-control actions had already reduced larvae-breeding within the Games Village and the fresh initiatives would concentrate on the water bodies.         
	The dengue outbreak is under control, said Union health secretary Sujatha Rao. The increase in cases this year is not a surprise. Weve had excessive rain and conditions conducive for mosquitoes.        
	Public health experts have pointed out that previous outbreaks in 1996 and 2006 suggest that the number of cases usually peaks around early October.        
	We have much better treatment algorithms  doctors in government and private sector, even doctors in small nursing homes, can use these algorithms to determine exactly how to manage dengue, said M.K. Bhan, a senior paediatrician and secretary in the department of biotechnology. This has helped reduce fatalities since 1996.         
	Limited genetic-typing studies on samples from a few patients suggest that the dengue virus circulating in the capital this year is the serotype 1 virus, which spreads very fast but causes only mild disease.         
	There is no vaccine or medicine for dengue, an infection that spreads through the bites of the Aedes egypti mosquito. Doctors say that while the immune system eliminates the virus, patients are treated for symptoms such as fever and body ache.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Snow-bound mission                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: A 62-year-old glaciologist and Antarctic-veteran will lead the countrys first expedition to the South Pole  a 2,200km journey across icy and crevassed terrain from Indias Antarctic outpost to the pole this week.         
	Rasik Ravindra, director of the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research (NCAOR) in Goa, will lead the eight-member expedition that comes three decades after Indias first expedition to Antarctica  and 99 years after humans first touched the South Pole.         
	The team of scientists and logistics personnel will travel in ice trucks, conducting studies of snow chemistry, the continents bedrock topography, the atmosphere, and glacial landforms along the way. The return-trip back to Maitri, Indias Antarctic outpost, is expected to take about 40 days.         
	Although it is summer in Antarctica, the maximum temperatures the team is likely to encounter will be below -15C. As we move closer to the pole, we also gain altitude and average temperatures are expected to be 45C, Ravindra told The Telegraph.         
	The team members include only scientists who have previously spent winters in Antarctica and are familiar with the challenges that the continent offers. Ravindra was the leader of Indias wintering team during 1989-91, and has visited Maitri five times.         
	The other members include Mirza Javed Beg, a geologist and head of logistics at NCAOR, Thamban Meloth, an ice-core drilling expert, Ajay Dhar, a geophysicist, Asit Swain, a scientist with the Geological Survey of India, Pradip Malhotra, a central government health scheme doctor, and Krishna Murthy and Surat Singh, ice truck experts.         
	The South Pole is located on a plateau about 2,835m above sea level and marks the southern end of the Earths axis of rotation. The area around the pole is featureless except for hardened ridges of ice on the surface.         
	The team wont be the first Indians to reach the pole. In the 1970s, Paramjit Singh Sehra had done that as part of a Soviet expedition. And in 1989, another Indian, Colonel J.K. Bajaj, had also visited the South Pole as part of an international expedition.         
	Five members of a Norwegian expedition led by Ronald Amunsden were the first to reach the South Pole on December 14, 1911. A month later, a British expedition led by Robert Scott also reached the Pole, but died on their way back.         
	Indian scientists have asked the government to support a South Pole expedition since the early 2000s. India had launched scientific exploration of Antarctica in 1981 and had set up its permanent station, Maitri, on the edge of the continent in 1989.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Amar and Amitabh				                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: Amar Singh desperately wants to make himself politically dispensable in the Samajwadi Party.         
	He wants to spend more and more time with his family, nuclear and extended, which includes his wife Pankaja, twin daughters Drishti and Di- sha, the Bachchans and Anil Ambani and his wife Tina.         
	Three of us are in three different professions, acting, politics and business, but emotions and affection bind us together against all odds. I pray for this togetherness in times to come, said Singh.         
	That is why, when the Samajwadi is fighting with its back to the wall to retain its strength in the Uttar Pradesh legislative council elections, due on January 7, Singh, the partys general secretary and the second-most important person after chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, chose to ignore the polls.        
	In his latest blog, posted on December 31, Singh explained why. Of late, my level of sensibility and sense of political responsibility have taken a back seat. I have learnt to take personal criticism in my stride and for the first time in my political career I am giving more preference to my family and in the bargain I have chosen to ignore the council elections in my native state. No one is indispensable. I am desperate to create my political dispensability in order to avoid unnecessary tension and lot of hard work which is detrimental to my present state of health and is against my doctors advice.        
	Singh had his kidney transplanted last year in Singapore and was out of action for at least two months. Once he was certified fit, he was back in the thick of things, overseeing the Firozabad byelection that Mulayams daughter-in-law Dimple Yadav lost.         
	A section in the Samajwadi, resentful of Singhs enormous clout, spread the word that if he had not been around, Dimple might have won.         
	Singh himself attributed the defeat to Mulayams overconfidence.         
	Matters got complicated when Mulayams cousin and Rajya Sabha MP Ram Gopal Yadav ticked off Singh for speaking in a different voice and crossing the limit.         
	As rumours were rife that Singh would quit the Samajwadi, Mulayam, Ram Gopal and Mulayams son Akhilesh mollified him. Akhilesh publicly said Singh was like an uncle to him and all was forgotten and forgiven.        
	But Singhs blog indicated he was still under the weather. I am an eternal optimist and that is why in the present situation of absolute pessimism of political downfall, I want to reinvent myself as a family-oriented person, he wrote.        
	He is holidaying in Dubai with Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan and his family. I am missing Abhishek and Aishwarya as they are busy shooting somewhere in India, he said.         
	Ambani junior put in a brief appearance and then left for Goa to join his wife and sons.         
	Singhs Bollywood companions in Dubai included the members of Hindi cinemas erstwhile first family, the Kapoors, who were celebrating the 80th birthday of Raj Kapoors wife Krishna. The Bachchans are closely related to the Kapoors as our (Amitabh-Jaya) daughter Shweta is married to Nikhil who is grandson of the late Raj Kapoor, he wrote.        
	None from the Samajwadi brass  Mulayam, Ram Gopal and Akhilesh  was available for reaction.         
	An old-time MP dismissed Singhs pessimistic outpouring, saying: He is too indispensable to be sidelined or dumped. In the past, we know what happened to people like Raj Babbar, Beni Prasad Verma and Azam Khan when they took him on.

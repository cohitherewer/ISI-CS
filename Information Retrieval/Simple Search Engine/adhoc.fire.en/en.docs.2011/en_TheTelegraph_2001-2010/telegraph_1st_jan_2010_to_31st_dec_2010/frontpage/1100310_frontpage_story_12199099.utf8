          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                             A TV clip shows watch-and-ward staff preventing MPs from grabbing papers from Hamid Ansaris table on Monday                                  
	New Delhi, March 9: His eyes fixed on the TV set beaming images of pandemonium from the Rajya Sabha chamber, watch-and-ward officer Raghavender Singh waited to see if he would be called to the House.        
	The walkie-talkie in his right hand crackled, and Singhs tense face appeared to relax as he listened.        
	Sab control me hai (everythings under control), he smiled.        
	Rajya Sabha chairman Hamid Ansari today ordered watch-and-ward staff, or marshals, to evict seven MPs disrupting a planned discussion on the womens bill, but Singh wasnt among those summoned to the House.        
	For Parliaments watch- and-ward staff, occasions when they are called upon to physically remove MPs from a House are rare and bring them into the national spotlight, fleetingly, through television.        
	But these are occasions we would rather avoid altogether. Thats why he was smiling, Shoaib Ali, another watch-and-ward officer, laughed, pointing to Singh as they watched the TV in a room on the first floor of the Parliament complex.         
	Marshals summoned to ensure discipline inside the House are drawn from the watch-and-ward staff, who are responsible for the security of the inner precincts of the Parliament complex.        
	The marshals are picked on the basis of their perceived physical ability to lift MPs out of the House with ease, if necessary, a senior official in the Parliament security division said.        
	The marshals are trained to lead the MPs gently out of the House. But if the need arises, they may have to physically lift them. They need to be strong enough to do that easily, and gently, without hurting the MP, the official said.        
	Watch-and-ward staff have to repeatedly interact with MPs in the Parliament complex and the prospect of having to lift a member out of the House can be embarrassing, Singh said.        
	We cannot behave like cops dealing with a rowdy rally. We have to, at all times, ensure the dignity of the House, he said.        
	Normally, the Lok Sabha Speaker and the Rajya Sabha chairman are flanked by two marshals, one on either side. Other watch-and-ward staff monitor the entrances to the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha chambers.        
	But if the Speaker or Rajya Sabha chairperson anticipates disturbance by MPs, he can seek the deployment of additional marshals inside his House.        
	Additional marshals were deployed in the Rajya Sabha yesterday when the House met in the afternoon after repeated disruption in the morning by Samajwadi Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal members.        
	Today, Vice-President and House chairman Ansari called on marshals to physically evict seven MPs who were refusing to leave even after they were suspended for disrupting proceedings.        
	After the seven were evicted, a ring of marshals stood around the well of the House to prevent a repeat of yesterdays raid on Ansaris desk by any other protesting MPs.        
	Others like Shoaib Ali pasted photographs of the suspended MPs on a bulletin board outside the Rajya Sabha chamber so that fellow watch- and-ward staff can prevent them from entering for the rest of the session should they try to do so.

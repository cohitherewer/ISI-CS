          SAMBIT SAHA                                         
	Dec. 30: Shivraj Puri, the Citibank manager accused of masterminding a Rs 300-crore fraud on wealthy clients, was arrested today by Gurgaon police who said he might have played the stock market through the brokerage firm Normans Martin, possibly owned by his father.         
	Shivraj, a relationship manager in the Citibank branch in tony DLF-II City in Gurgaon, did not just involve his father in the swindle but several members of his family, whose origins lie in Calcutta.         
	Raghuraj, his father, used to live with his family near Gariahat and ran a foreign exchange outfit called Normans Ross, which had its office in Gillander House at Dalhousie Square till the end of the last decade.         
	Shivraj had sold a trust scheme to corporate and other moneyed clients of Citibank by showing a forged approval from the stock market watchdog, Sebi, and dangling the bait of 18-24 per cent annual return when bank interest rates were ruling at 6-8 per cent.         
	He funnelled the money into 81 accounts opened in various banks in the names of his relatives, and then into three brokerage firms, Religare Securities, Bonanza and Okaya. The brokerages did not know whose money they were handling and treated Shivraj as another rich client.         
	The alleged fraud came to light on Tuesday when one of Citibanks clients mentioned to a senior manager the scheme Shivraj had sold.         
	Gurgaon police commissioner S.S. Deswal said: The size of the fraud in which investors were allegedly swindled could be around Rs 300 crore.         
	He estimated that Rs 200 crore belonged to companies and the rest to individuals, whom Shivraj might have met by virtue of his position in Citibank, where he has worked for eight years. A resident of Gurgaons upmarket Hamilton Court, he could have come in contact with some as neighbours.         
	The Hero Group of the Munjals today admitted that it was one of the victims of Shivrajs swindle.         
	Deswal said Raghuraj might be the owner of Normans Martin. The Mumbai offices of Normans Martin and Normans Ross bear the same address, 94 Mittal Chambers at Nariman Point.         
	Another link suggesting that the two companies have the same people behind them is Rajendra Chand, who is a non-executive director in Normans Martin. Chands connection to the Puri family goes back to Calcutta where he was managing director in ITC Classic Financial Services.         
	Raghuraj and wife Diksha, who also have a daughter, were well known on the citys social circuit. Shivraj grew up in Calcutta where he studied in St James School but moved to Delhi after Chands shift to the capital following an unceremonious exit from ITC Classic. Chand, said to be something of a godfather to Shivraj, professed ignorance about the alleged scam.

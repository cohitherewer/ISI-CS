          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, March 6: A car driver tried to rob a woman passenger at knifepoint at Salt Lakes Sector V just hours before a cabbie kidnapped IT professional Sandipan Das from the same area.        
	The attack on Deborpita Bagchi on February 26 afternoon came to light last night after driver Sushanta Ghoshs arrest, turning the spotlight once again on the unsafe roads around the citys software hub.        
	Ghosh, the driver of a private car, was plying the blue Swift Desire as a share taxi without the owners knowledge, police said. Deborpita, a private firm employee in her mid-20s, had hailed it at Rajarhats Chinar Park around 3.30pm, meaning to travel to Topsia. The car already had a passenger; another got in a while later.        
	The car took the Rajarhat Expressway. The other two passengers got off in front of the DLF Building at New Town and Technopolis at Sector V, an officer said.        
	The car then climbed the Nabadiganta flyover across the Wipro intersection. After crossing the flyover the car made a sudden turn. The driver pulled out a knife and told the woman to hand over all her belongings, the officer said.        
	At that point, Deborpita apparently screamed for help and a nervous Ghosh opened the door to let her out. She noted down the cars number before it sped away towards the Wipro crossing, the officer said.        
	Deborpita lodged a complaint with Sector V police station in the evening. Ghosh, arrested from Salt Lake, was today remanded in nine days judicial custody.        
	His lawyer claimed a frame-up. The (alleged) incident took place around 3.30pm and she lodged the police complaint only at 8.30pm. What was she doing all this while? Soumyajit Raha asked.        
	The police said Ghosh did not have a criminal record and that his amateurish attempt at robbery may have come on the spur of the moment.        
	The news of the incident comes at a time the home secretary has promised another police station in Sector V following the abduction of Sandipan on February 26 night.

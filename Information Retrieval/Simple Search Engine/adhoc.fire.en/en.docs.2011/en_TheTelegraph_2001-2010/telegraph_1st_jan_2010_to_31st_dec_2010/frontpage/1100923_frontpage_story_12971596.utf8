The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Over to the three judges
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Over to the three judges

	The Ayodhya verdict is scheduled to be delivered on Friday, unless last-minute interventions come through. The Union government has appealed for calm and banned the transmission of bulk SMS and MMS to avert the spread of mischievous rumours. ( )        
	The Telegraph portrays the three judges  and their life away from the bench and law books  who are on the threshold of delivering the judgment.              
	Armed policemen stand guard outside 24 Gautam Pally  the address in the heart of Lucknow that houses a 62-year-old judge.        
	Justice Dharam Veer Sharma, the senior-most judge on the special bench of Allahabad High Court that is due to give its verdict on September 24, shares the house with his elder sister.        
	He did not get married, says Ashoke Kumar Sharma, a veteran advocate of Allahabad High Court. He is a deeply religious man and cooks his own food.         
	A strict vegetarian, the judge sometimes cooks for his colleagues, too. Their verdict: hes as good with the ladle as he is with the gavel. But such occasions are few and Justice Sharma, who sprang a surprise with his dissenting verdict on Monday, mostly keeps to himself.              
	Colleagues speak of his austere lifestyle  Sharma is seen either in white dhoti-kurta or white shirt and white trousers  and his well-stocked library of law books and journals. He is known for his sense of fair play, adds Ashoke. For Justice Sharma, law has a human face and he goes out of his way to help poor petitioners, says another colleague.        
	Spondylitis has caused him immense physical discomfort in the past few months, but he sits hunched in front of the personal computer in his study poring over court papers and possibly the judgment he will deliver six days before he retires on October 1.        
	Sharma graduated in arts in 1967 and got his law degree in 1970 from a college in Bulandshahr. In 1972, he got through the judicial service to become a district court judge.         
	Before joining Allahabad High Court, he had worked as the chief law officer, Uttar Pradesh Financial Corporation, Kanpur Nagar, from July 1989 to October 1991 and then as joint secretary, legal remembrance, for the state government in the late nineties. This assignment, which he fulfilled till July 2001, would have exposed him to the role that law plays in government departments.         
	In 2002, he was promoted as district and sessions judge, and joined the Lucknow bench of the high court in 2005.        
	Justice Sudhir Agarwal, at 52 the youngest of the three judges on the special bench, could not have been more dissimilar to Justice Sharma. Hes well turned out, likes to read comics and watch soaps on TV, and enjoys spending time with friends from the Bar and the Bench.        
	Unlike the senior judge, who sticks to Hindi, Justice Agarwal is mostly heard speaking in English even outside the courtroom.        
	The judge, who lives with his wife and children on Beli Road in Allahabad, is known for his incisive and precise judgments. During 25 years of his association with the Bar as advocate in Allahabad High Court, Justice Agarwal has been familiar with the way a case is contested by senior advocates. The Ayodhya title suit being a multi-cornered contest, he easily swam through these procedures and arguments during the last three years as member of this bench, said a former colleague in Allahabad.        
	A junior who had worked under Justice Agarwal described him as extremely articulate and well-versed with the nuances of civil law. He is unbending in his approach to the issues of law and always plays by the law book, the junior added.        
	Agarwal graduated with science from Agra University in 1977, then studied law at Meerut University, earning his degree in 1980. He joined the Allahabad High Court Bar in October the same year. Starting out as a tax advocate, he later shifted to service laws.         
	As standing counsel for the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation, Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam and Allahabad University in the nineties, he proved his depth of understanding of law. In September 2003, he was appointed additional advocate-general. He joined the Allahabad High Court Bench in October 2005 and was confirmed as a permanent judge in August 2007.         
	His verdicts are always marked by earthy legal wisdom and rarely contradicted by the Supreme Court, an advocate said.         
	Justice Sibghat Ullah Khan, the third member of the special bench, was Justice Agarwals colleague in the Allahabad High Court Bar and is known for his razor-sharp wit. He has always been aided by a strong sense of history and the role of law in altering history. He is not ready to put a foot wrong, says advocate D.P. Gupta.        
	Justice Khan, 58, earned his law degree from Aligarh Muslim University in 1975 and enrolled himself as an advocate the same year. He specialised in the civil, service and revenue areas of law for 25 years before being elevated as permanent judge of Allahabad High Court in 2002.        
	We have many verdicts of Justice Khan in the AIR Law Books which are milestones on civil disputes, a law officer in Allahabad High Court said. The All India Reporter law books report judgments of the Supreme Court and the high courts.        
	Originally from Etah in western Uttar Pradesh, the judge now lives with his wife and children on Dramond Road in Allahabad. He lives a simple life, is usually turned out in shirt and trousers in sober colours and equally at ease in Hindi and English.        
	Known to push for out-of-court settlements of civil cases, he is said to have settled 2,000 cases through negotiations. Justice Khan, who was not even born when the Ayodhya title dispute was brought to court 60 years ago, has been vocal in asking the advocates to let the special bench deliver the verdict this week and not delay it any further.

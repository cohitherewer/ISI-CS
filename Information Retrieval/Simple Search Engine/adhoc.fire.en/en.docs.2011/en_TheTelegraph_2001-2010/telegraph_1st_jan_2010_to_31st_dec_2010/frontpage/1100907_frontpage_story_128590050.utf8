	New Delhi, Sep 7 (PTI) Teen amateur sensation Rashid Khan will spearhead a five-strong Indian golf team announced today for the Asian Games in Guangzhou, China this November.
    The 19-year-old Rashid, a two-time champion at the prestigious amateur event the Faldo series, will be joined by Abhijeet Chaddha, Rahul Bajaj and Abhinav Lohan with Ashbeer Saini as the reserve player.
    The women's team for the event was also announced today by the Indian Golf Union (IGU). The team comprises Shreya Ghei, Vani Kapoor, Gurbani Singh with Shradhanjali Singh as the reserve player.
    The golf event is scheduled November 12 to 15.   The players were selected after a trial in Noida and Bangalore in July.
    "I am glad that the team has been chosen early which gives adequate time for the team members to travel and live together," the team's Australian coach Peter Murphy said.

	New Delhi, March 18: Next time he wisecracks the only womens bill that matters is your shopping bill, you can tell him to go take a ride in his shopping cart.        
	Men spend more money than women in Indias malls, according to the first detailed analysis of mall crawlers across seven cities.        
	The study has thrown up unexpected findings that contradict prevailing assumptions, reinforce some beliefs and suggest the countrys modern malls share parallels with traditional melas.         
	A sample: window-shopping appears important for all  people with large disposable incomes as well as low-volume buyers who bring footfalls rather than money. (See chart)        
	There are plenty of surprises, said Shelja Jose Kuruvilla, assistant professor at the Institute of Technology and Management, New Mumbai, and lead author of the study published this week in the Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services.         
	Mall managers have long feared that low-volume shoppers visit the sites more often and spend more time just peering at merchandise, while contributing little to actual retail sales, Kuruvilla said.         
	Her study, however, shows that heavy-volume shoppers visit malls more often and spend more time  22 per cent of heavy shoppers spend more than four hours in a mall during a typical visit, in contrast to just 9 per cent of low-volume shoppers.        
	It was assumed heavy shoppers would walk in with clear intentions of what theyre going to buy, quickly pick up stuff, and leave, Kuruvilla said. But we found that heavy shoppers enjoy window-shopping as much as low volume shoppers.         
	It appears window-shopping is a very important part of the mall experience in India. People seem to enjoy the experience of just looking around  its just the same thing they would do in a traditional mela, she said.         
	The findings are drawn from the responses of 2,700 mall visitors in Bangalore, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Mumbai, New Delhi, New Mumbai, and Vadodara, who were intercepted and questioned.        
	International studies show that women spend more money in malls. But the Indian analysis suggests that men not only spend more money, but also visit malls almost as frequently and spend almost the same amount of time there as women.        
	Kuruvilla said she had also expected to find that smaller families and families with a single child  more likely to have higher levels of disposable income  would buy more in malls. But she found that larger families purchase more and the greater the number of children, the greater the purchases. The study also found no correlation between the number of earning members in a family and the purchase volume.        
	Retail marketing experts say the trends could change over time. Indias mall sector is still evolving  malls are still drawing many who may be seeking novelty, said Prashant Mishra, associate professor of marketing at the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, who was not associated with the study. This might explain the window-shopping patterns observed, Mishra said.        
	Footfalls driven by mere curiosity could persist, he said, for up to two years after a mall has opened for the public.        
	Kuruvillas research, which was part of her doctoral study at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, has also led to a mathematical model to predict the viability of malls in a city or a new area of a city.

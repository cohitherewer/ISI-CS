The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Police gun stolen at IPL 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Police gun stolen at IPL 
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                      Cheerleaders at Wednesday rsquo;s match in Delhi                          
	New Delhi, March 19: Five thousand security personnel, 90 closed-circuit cameras and 180 metal detectors  enough to keep the likes of the Lashkar-e-Toiba away from IPL matches, Delhi police had claimed.        
	But not enough, apparently, to prevent a petty thief from stealing a policemans service revolver right off his hip at the capitals first Indian Premier League III match on Wednesday.        
	Minutes after the Delhi Daredevils vs Mumbai Indians match began at the Feroz Shah Kotla, Babulal Meena, a probationary sub-inspector, realised his holster was empty.        
	He thought the revolver might have fallen off the holster while he was being jostled by the crowds, and began searching for it. When he failed to find it, he panicked and alerted his superiors at the grounds.        
	While no officer was willing to confirm or deny the incident on record, police sources said it had caused huge embarrassment to their bosses at a time they were engaged in planning for Commonwealth Games security.        
	It comes across as if we, the police, who are supposed to protect the common man, cannot take care of our own belongings. Also, theres another worry: a service revolver in the hands of a criminal could have dire consequences, an officer said on condition he not be named.        
	But what is really making the police hang their head in shame is that they let a man carrying a revolver get out of their three-tier security cordon at the stadium.        
	More than 2,000 police personnel were inside the stadium and at least 3,000 others manned the immediate neighbourhood, which includes the towering police headquarters.        
	At the stadium, the outermost security ring covered the Kotla perimeter, with Delhi police in charge; the middle tier was manned by paramilitary forces along with the police; and the innermost ring had a team of 25 commandos.        
	The police say they have 90 CCTV cameras inside and outside the stadium. Of these, 12 are PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) cameras.        
	There are 80 door-frame and 100 hand-held metal detectors for scanning the spectators. Also, for the first time, four scanners have been installed inside the stadium to check even the food brought in for the players.

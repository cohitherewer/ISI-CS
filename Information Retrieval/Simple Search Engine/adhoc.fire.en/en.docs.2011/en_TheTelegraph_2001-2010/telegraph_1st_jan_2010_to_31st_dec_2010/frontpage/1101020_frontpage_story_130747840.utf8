    However, some passengers complained of uneasiness as lights went off inside the compartments immediately after the derailment at about 9.30 AM, they said.
    Passengers were evacuated through the driver's cabin door by police and fire brigade personnel.
    Metro services have been suspended after the incident. But presently metro service is available between Girish Park to Dum Dum in one side and Maidan to Kavi Subhash on the other side.   
	Authorities say its still not confirmed when the service will run in its usual way.

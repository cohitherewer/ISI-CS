The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamata on Delhi rollercoaster
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mamata on Delhi rollercoaster
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	New Delhi, June 1: She came, she skipped, she scowled and then she smiled.        
	Mamata Banerjee rode a rollercoaster of emotions in Delhi on Tuesday, a day before the results of the Bengal civic polls in which exit polls have put her party ahead of the others.        
	The railway minister skipped the mornings cabinet meeting, perhaps thinking she had earned a well-deserved break after a gruelling campaign against her own ally in Delhi, the Congress, and the enemy everywhere, the CPM.        
	However, when she chose to address the media at her Delhi house after 2.30pm, conspiracy theorists had a field day and some journalists peppered her with questions on the possible reason for staying away from the cabinet meeting.        
	Maybe it was the heat  that particular belt in Delhi clocked a maximum temperature of 42.5 degrees Celsius today, over 6 degrees above that in Calcutta. Mamata lost her cool and committed what her rivals termed a blunder.        
	There was nothing serious in the cabinet. So, I did not go. It is a casual affair, she said.        
	Ministers  and movers and shakers in other fields  made to sit through soporific meetings or presentations may empathise with her but the cabinet meeting today had only one agenda: Presidents rule in Jharkhand where somersault specialist Shibu Soren has tied the BJP up in knots.        
	The CPM seized on Mamatas comment to insist that it had insulted and belittled Jharkhand. Being a cabinet minister, you are concerned with India as a whole and you are not concerned only with your state or constituency which you come from. To say that Jharkhand is a small issue is very, very insulting and belittling, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said.        
	Politicians in Jharkhand were also not amused. JMM central committee member Supriyo Bhattacharya advised Mamata to remember that Jharkhand generated the maximum freight revenue for the railways.        
	Bhattacharya is not too far off the mark. Jharkhand, which has vast natural resources, accounts for Rs 9,000 crore or 30 per cent of the railways annual freight revenue.        
	It was then the turn of Mamata to smell a conspiracy. Some powers are trying to drive a wedge between us (the Trinamul Congress and the Congress). And you (the media) are making an issue of it. Attending or not attending a meeting is my decision.        
	She did not identify the powers but told a television channel later: Maybe other political parties who dont like us, perhaps the CPM.         
	However, returning to Delhi after a long gap, the Trinamul leader chose to leave behind the bitterness that marked the campaign against the Congress during the civic elections.        
	Mamata clarified that Congress leaders were not to be blamed for the attempt to create the divide. Relations between the Trinamul Congress and the Congress are very good. I have great respect for the Prime Minister, she said.        
	The edge was back in her voice when asked about perceived differences with the home ministry on the inquiry into the Jnaneswari Express tragedy. You (the media) feel there is problem but there is nothing from my side. But if there is problem, then I will not tell you. It is between me and the home minister.         
	She charged a section of the media with being CPM mouthpieces. It is our government. The rail ministry or the home ministry is ours. We will decide what steps are to be taken, she declared.        
	Mamata did not repeat the suggestion of a CPM hand in the train disaster but she also did not point fingers at the Maoists, unlike home minister P. Chidambaram. I am not an astrologer. I cannot say anything before the investigation, she said.        
	In the evening, a mellower Mamata attended an event to mark UPA IIs first anniversary. She was seen discussing with Sonia Gandhi the contents of a booklet on the performance of the government, sometimes sharing a laugh with the Congress president.        
	Mamata is expected to be in Calcutta in time for the civic poll results.

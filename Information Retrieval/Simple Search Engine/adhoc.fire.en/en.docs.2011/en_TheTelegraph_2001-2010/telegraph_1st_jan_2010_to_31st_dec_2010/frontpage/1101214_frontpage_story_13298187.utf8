										                      The one-year-old who was found at the ghat after the blast Tapas Chakraborty                                
	Lucknow, Dec. 13: Varanasi police have traced the parents of the one-year-old girl who was found at the Dashashwamedh Ghat after the December 7 blast and have detained them for questioning.        
	Officers suspect that Neelesh Pandey, 42, a security guard with a private company in Varanasi, and wife Geeta, 37, had abandoned the baby because they already had four children.        
	The couple, who had left Varanasi the evening of the blast, were today traced in Ballia, 60km away, and brought back for questioning. The child, named Ganga by the priests who found her, is in a childrens home run by Child Line, a voluntary organisation. Her real name is Gauri.        
	The parents are contradicting each other. Neelesh said he had a one-year-old daughter who died recently, said Prem Prakash, Varanasi deputy inspector-general of police.  
	According to him, Geeta had acknowledged Gauri as her daughter but claimed the blast had knocked the baby out of her arms and, failing to find her, the couple had decided she was dead.        
	She couldnt explain why they did not wait to find out if the girl was actually dead, and why they did not inform the police, Prakash said.        
	Gauris photograph was published in the newspapers on December 8 morning, but it was only yesterday that the neighbours of Neelesh and Geeta in Varanasis Bhelupur area contacted police and identified her.        
	The Pandeys home was locked. The police broke the door open and found a phone book that had Neeleshs mobile number. By tracking the number, the police ascertained that he was in Ballia. The Pandeys landlord too confirmed that the couple had left for Ballia on the day of the blast.        
	Today, the police found Neelesh in a gurdwara in Ballia where he had given his name as Tuntun. Neelesh and Geeta had apparently put up with a relative in Ballia before they moved to the gurdwara.        
	The police found Neelesh alone and learnt Geeta had left for Ghazipur, 30km from Varanasi, where the couples four other children  two boys and two girls  lived with a relative. She was picked up from Ballia railway station before she could catch her train.        
	Sister Linci, coordinator of Child Line, who had been in touch with the police, said she had called Neelesh on his mobile yesterday. He said his daughter was dead and refused to talk to me any further.

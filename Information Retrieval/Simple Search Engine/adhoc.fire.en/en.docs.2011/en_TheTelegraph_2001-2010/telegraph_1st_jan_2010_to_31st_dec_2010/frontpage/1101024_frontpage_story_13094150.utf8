	New Delhi, Oct. 23: At least 72 per cent Indians should be legally guaranteed subsidised food grains in the next financial year, a Sonia Gandhi-headed panel recommended to the Centre today.        
	By 2014, when the general election is scheduled, the figure should reach 75 per cent, said a National Advisory Council meeting, chaired by Sonia, which discussed the proposed law on food security.        
	The council estimates that the programme would cost the government an additional Rs 23,231 crore on food subsidies in 2014 alone. The Centre now spends about Rs 56,700 crore a year towards subsidies under the public distribution system (PDS). The food security plan, to be implemented mainly through the PDS, would raise the figure to Rs 80,000 crore a year by 2014.        
	Panel member Harsh Mander said 36 per cent of the population now fell in the below-poverty-line (BPL) category and received 35kg grains a month at a subsidised Rs 6 a kg. Of the BPL card-holders, the poorest 40 per cent were covered by the Antyodaya scheme, entitling them to 35kg of grains a month at Rs 3 a kg. Some states also provide subsidised grains to above-poverty-line (APL) families, but there is no official data on these beneficiaries numbers.        
	According to the panels recommendations, the proposed national food security act should legally guarantee cheap grains to 90 per cent of the rural population and 50 per cent of the urban population by 2014. This comes to a national average of 75 per cent of the total population.        
	The beneficiaries are to be divided into two categories: priority and general households. The priority households  46 per cent of rural families and 28 per cent of urban families  would be entitled to 35kg of grains a month (rice at Rs 3 a kg, wheat at Rs 2 a kg, and millets at Re 1 a kg).        
	The general households  44 per cent of rural families and 22 per cent of urban families  would be entitled to 20kg of grains a month at a price not exceeding half the current minimum support price for the grains.        
	Academic and panel member Narendra Jadhav said: If implemented, it would go a long way in eradicating hunger and malnutrition.        
	The new programme will be supplemented by a few other nutrition schemes for pre-school children and pregnant women.        
	The council wants the food law passed quickly so the programme can start the next financial year, covering 72 per cent of the population, including 85 per cent of rural families and 40 per cent of urban families. It has recommended biometric smart cards to check PDS corruption.        
	Right to Food Campaign, a pressure group advocating subsidised food for all, expressed disappointment.         
	These recommendations are a step forward but they are not close to what we are demanding, said lawyer Colin Gonsalves who is associated with the campaign.

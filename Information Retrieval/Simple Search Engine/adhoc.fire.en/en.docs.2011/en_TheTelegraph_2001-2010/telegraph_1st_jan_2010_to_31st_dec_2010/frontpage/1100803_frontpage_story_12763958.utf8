The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Party packs Presidency VC panel
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Party packs Presidency VC panel
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 2: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has dipped into its inner circle to pick three academics who will find the first vice-chancellor of Presidency University.        
	The choice of the three nominees makes it clear that the CPM will grant Presidency freedom but the reins will be held by a Left loyalist.        
	Economist Amiya Bagchi will head the panel that will have as members the former director of ISI, Calcutta, Sankar Pal; and the Jadavpur University vice-chancellor, P.N. Ghosh.         
	The chief minister had acted with rare alacrity to help his alma mater break free from government-party control after Mamata Banerjee asked at The Telegraph-Calcutta Club debate last November why the Left government had failed to do so in over three decades.         
	But the drive to rescue Presidency appears to have remained restricted to passing a bill that allows it to be a university.        
	Bagchi, Pal and Ghosh have impeccable academic records. There is no reason to doubt their proficiency in their fields, but this was one opportunity for Bhattacharjee to show that the Left could look beyond what was readily available. He squandered that chance.        
	Bagchi has been associated with the party for over four decades. Our party had once thought of making him an MP, given his involvement. He is now the director of the Institute of Development Studies, which organises seminars on subjects close to our partys heart, a CPM leader said.        
	In a Bengal where the Anil Biswas model of education rules, becoming a vice-chancellor without being in Alimuddin Streets good books is impossible. JU vice-chancellor Ghoshs credential, thus, is impeccable even beyond academics.         
	Pal is known to be close to finance minister Asim Dasguptas brother Atish. The finance ministers twin enjoys the personal support of the chief minister, whom he knows from their Presidency days.        
	Asked if the move to pack the committee with CPM faithful could lead to the selection of a mediocre person with strong party links, a state committee member said: Presidency University needs a VC with good academic credentials. But it is also to be seen whether the chosen one is supportive of the state governments policies. A person from a different school of thought could be worrisome for us.         
	It is this worry that pulled Bengal from a more glorious academic past as the CPM led by Biswas continued with the demolition job begun by his guru Promode Dasgupta. Biswas used to pick and choose VCs. If thats done again by the CPM nominees, Presidency will have a mediocre VC, said an economist.         
	Bhattacharjee seems to have blown the chance to get the best from Bengal, from Nobel laureate Amartya Sen to Kaushik Basu, the former Cornell University professor who is now an adviser to the Union finance ministry.        
	Basu had earlier told The Telegraph how keen he was to see Presidency reclaim its former glory. I would not mind, he had said when asked if he would agree to join a panel for Presidency.        
	Several Presidency teachers expressed doubts whether those on the panel were in the know of the best models of education around the world at the moment.        
	The panel has been asked to submit the list of suitable candidates to the government within September 3, said Satish Tiwary, principal secretary, higher education.        
	The panels shortlist will be sent to the governor, the chancellor, who will pick the vice-chancellor.         
	The notification on the search committee does not mention the number of candidates the panel is supposed to recommend. Normally, up to three candidates are named.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Battle of Gayatri wills in court 
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                            Gayatri Devi                                  
	Jaipur, May 20: One will, allegedly forced out of an infirm Rajmata Gayatri Devi, and another written on a hotel letter-pad by her son today took centre-stage in the continuing court battle over the Jaipur royal familys property, worth over Rs 1,000 crore.        
	Gayatri Devis grandchildren told a court their late father Jagat Singhs so-called 1996 will that disinherited them was a fake and a part of a conspiracy by Prithviraj, the Rajmatas stepson who managed her financial affairs.        
	Devraj Kumar, 28, and Lalitya Kumari, 30, claim to be in possession of the late queens last will that allegedly bequeaths to them all her properties. It was made last year, months before the Rajmatas death in July, and was apparently left with her eldest stepson Bhawani Singh.        
	Prithviraj claims the Rajmatas will was made under duress in her last days when she was old, weak and unable to even talk properly. He recently sought a court stay on the operations of the succession certificate, issued by a Jaipur court in February 2009 to her grandchildren.        
	Petitioners Prithviraj and his niece Urvashi Devi want the courts to accept the 1996 will made by Gayatri Devis son Jagat, disinheriting his children and leaving all his property to his mother. If this will is accepted, the properties will be distributed among other members of the royal family, including the petitioners but excluding Devraj and Lalitya.        
	Today, arguing Devrajs case, his counsel M.M. Ranjan said Jagat had inherited all his property and therefore had no right to disinherit his children. Also, Jagats will was never executed by any court, he said.        
	Ranjan said Jagats so-called will appeared to be merely a letter written under the letterhead of Raj Mahal Palace Hotel, one of the many heritage hotels owned by the Jaipur royal family.        
	Devraj alleged that since Jagat stayed with Gayatri Devi before his death in 1997, there was no reason for him to write a letter. He added that the letter had never before been presented in any court.        
	Prithvirajs counsel Ramji Lal Gupta said Gayatri Devi had herself wanted to probate Jagats will (get a judicial certificate saying it was genuine) and that the will bore her signature. Also, he said, a letter written on a letter-pad can be considered a will. The next hearing is on May 24.        
	Gayatri Devi had mentioned the 1996 will by Jagat in 2006, saying he had disinherited his children and left all his property to his mother. This had soured her relations with her grandchildren.        
	In November 2008, Gayatri Devi had mended ties with her grandchildren by withdrawing the 1996 will and having a settlement certificate drawn up, making Devraj and Lalitya sole inheritors of her property.        
	Devraj had received the succession certificate on February 19, 2009, but made it public only in August after the Rajmatas death on July 29. At that time, there was no expression of dissent from any royal family member.        
	Sources, though, claimed that the Rajmata never owned the familys immovable properties such as Lily Pool, Moti Doongri Fort or the Rambagh complex, all being disputed in courts.         
	However, Gayatri Devis 2009 will also mentions her personal movable properties like streedhan (gifts before, during and after marriage). Legally, no one could stop her from passing on these properties to anyone she wanted, legal experts said.        
	In 2006, Devraj and Lalitya had alleged that Prithviraj had diluted their share in heritage hotel Jai Mahal Palace, inherited by their father and later passed on to them, from 99 per cent to 7 per cent and transferred the remaining 92 per cent to his son Vijit Singh. They had moved the Company Law Board, where the case is pending.

	Durgapur, July 29: In Sholays Chambal-like badlands, train dacoits had to put logs on tracks; in Bengal they just pull the chain, get their accomplices in, take their time robbing passengers and then jump off without any railway employee or guard arriving to ask questions.        
	A gang of about 30 robbed and slashed passengers in five coaches of an escort-less night train in Purulia in the early hours today, after stopping the Bihar-bound Tata-Chhapra Express for what the victims claimed was an hour.        
	The robbers seemed to know the train would not move till they were done: they had parked their SUVs and motorcycles nearby, the passengers said.        
	Guard J.C. Mudi was later beaten up by passengers who claimed he was drunk and had slept through the attack near Murulia village, between Muradi and Madhukunda stations in Adra division.        
	Of the 30-odd passengers robbed of cash, cellphones and other valuables, some 12 were hit with revolver butts or slashed with choppers and knives, and a 70-year-old man had to be hospitalised with a gash in his left palm.        
	The incident comes at a time Mamata Banerjees handling of the railway ministry has come under the scanner following a series of railway tragedies, some in her home state.        
	Railway officials offered the plea that there was no hard and fast rule to have Railway Protection Force (RPF) guards on every night train. It all depends on the vulnerability of the route and the availability of manpower, an official said.        
	S.N. Chakraborty, superintendent of railway police, Kharagpur, claimed the train had stopped for only about 15 minutes, not an hour. He, however, failed to answer either of these two questions:        
	 Why had no one come to see who had pulled the chain and why?        
	 On whose instructions did the train start moving again?        
	The passengers of the Chhapra-bound train said the robbers were speaking in Hindi but Chakraborty suggested this could have been a ploy by a local gang to mislead the police.         
	Ashok Singh, 34, a trader from Tatanagar, said: Around 2am, the young man sitting next to me pulled the chain. When I asked what he was doing, he slapped me and pointed a revolver at me. As the train stopped, masked men climbed in from near a level-crossing.        
	Later, when the train reached Damodar station around 3.30am, the passengers beat up the guard. They also alleged that the Government Railway Police post at the station refused to register a complaint saying the crime was committed outside their area.        
	When the train reached Burnpur around 4.10am, the passengers sat down in front of the station managers office and on the tracks demanding immediate treatment for the injured. The train left Burnpur around 8.30am after 11 of the injured had been discharged with first aid.        
	The divisional railway manager of Adra, A.K. Garekar, said RPF guards were not deployed on the Adra-Asansol stretch as there had not been any such crime on that stretch earlier.        
	Trinamul Congress leaders reacted cautiously. Its a railway matter; we wont comment, Partha Chatterjee said.        
	Former railway minister Lalu Prasad said that if the route is sensitive, escorts should have been provided. Passenger ki suraksha par koyi dhyan nahi dey raha hai (nobody is giving a thought to passenger security), he said.

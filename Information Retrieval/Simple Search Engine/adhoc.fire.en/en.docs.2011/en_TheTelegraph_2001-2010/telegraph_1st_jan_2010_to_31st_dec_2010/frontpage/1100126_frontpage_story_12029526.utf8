	New Delhi, Jan. 25: A water filter that can withstand a nuclear, biological and chemical attack and slake parched throats despite a mushroom cloud hovering will shortly be available in your neighbourhood mall.        
	If that isnt enough, the government has also chosen the auspicious eve of the 60th Republic Day to mark half-a-dozen military technologies for the retail market today.        
	The filter, using reverse osmosis, was so far produced by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) only for frontline soldiers who are assessed to be the most vulnerable in the event of a tactical nuclear or biological attack in a war scenario.        
	An American outfit, Texas Universitys IC2 Institute, was engaged by the Ficci after it entered into an agreement for a technology commercialisation programme for the DRDO.        
	The DRDO offered 125 products to IC2, which specialises in identifying and assessing technologies. The outfit selected six. They are:        
	A multi-insect repellent used by soldiers in counter-insurgency operations mainly in the Northeast. A memorandum of understanding was signed with Jyothy Laboratories and Alkali Metals for the transfer of knowhow and for its marketing.        
	Woolcare, another insecticide. MoU with Jyothy Laboratories.        
	Electrochromic window, a technology that allows soldiers in the desert to electronically regulate the flow of light and heat through the specialised glass into their bunkers. MoU signed with GSC Glass.        
	The nuclear-attack-protected Reverse Osmosis-based water purification system; MoU signed with Deltapure Water and Ariva Group.        
	Explosive detection kit that helps in analysing the contents of a bomb, for installation in airports, railway stations and public spaces; MoU with Vantage Security.        
	High altitude pulmonary oedema chamber, used by soldiers in Siachen. DRDO says it can also be used for the elderly who suffer from hypoxia (difficulty in absorbing oxygen). MoU with MGM Associates.

          OUR BUREAU                             A different ball game: Shibu Soren at his Bokaro residence on Thursday. Picture by Pankaj Singh                                        
	Ranchi/Bokaro/New Delhi, May 20: Chief minister Shibu Soren today declared he would continue in office, virtually ruling out handing over the reins to BJPs Arjun Munda next week.         
	Laughing off suggestions that he had blessed Munda as his successor, Soren said he had never committed to relinquishing office. He added that if the BJP wanted to share power on a rotational basis, then he would be chief minister for the first 28 months.        
	Soren said the formula of leading the government by turn had been worked out by BJP and not JMM. These issues will be decided by the JMM executive committee, he added.        
	When reminded that he was yet to get himself elected to the Assembly, Soren said he would announce his plans tomorrow. According to him, all his party members would assemble in Bokaro tomorrow to decide the course of action.         
	However, that could be easier said than done as two dissenting JMM MLAs, Teklal Mahto and Lobin Hembrom, have already left for Delhi, officially for health check-ups, but almost certainly to meet Congress leaders.        
	Another disgruntled legislator, Simon Marandi, is already camping in Calcutta and he said that Nalin Soren, the Shikaripara MLA, would be joining him soon.         
	Sources claimed other dissenting MLAs, already in touch with the Congress, would be leaving the state as well, making the task of procuring letters of support difficult for the BJP on D-Day.         
	Meanwhile, with party chief Nitin Gadkari away in Europe and nobody apparently authorised by him to deal with the Jharkhand issue, the BJP today appeared to be in total disarray over what to do following Sorens sudden turnaround.        
	Party spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman refused to entertain questions over the latest crisis and most other senior party leaders too skirted queries over the issue.        
	BJPs situation could be gauged from the fact that Munda flew to Delhi yesterday to finalise distribution of portfolios in discussion with central leaders. But before he could do so the JMM chiefs latest flip-flop saw him rushing back to Ranchi this afternoon.         
	BJP sources said the party was caught between the devil and the deep sea. Insiders said the onus would land at the door of a couple of central leaders of the party since they pushed for forming a government in Jharkhand against will of a majority.         
	Advaniji was firmly against forming a government with JMM support. Some senior party leaders including Gadkariji were more than eager and had their way, said a senior leader of the party.         
	Gadkari is squarely being blamed for the embarrassment and in Jharkhand, party leaders are calling him gadmad-kari (wobbly) who had gaddha-kari (dug a grave) for the party. We are losing public support in the state because of our power hungry approach. Party workers are demoralised, said a BJP leader.         
	Speculations were rife that the BJP might precipitate the situation and withdraw support to the government.         
	It was learnt that a section of central party leaders opposed to government formation from the beginning wanted the party not to allow the situation to drag on and embarrass the party further. The pro-government section, however, does not want to act in hurry and is using the pretext of Gadkaris absence to wait and watch.         
	We are not taking Shibu Soren seriously. We are mediating with his son Hemant. Munda has gone to Ranchi to assess the situation and based on his feedback, the party will take a decision, said a BJP leader in favour of government formation. The BJP leader said Soren was actually bargaining by refusing to quit and pointed out that he had little option but to quit as there was no way he could get elected before the June 25 deadline.         
	When contacted, Hemant refused to comment on the U-turn. The party legislators and leaders have authorised Guruji to take a decision and he will be taking it at an opportune moment. Right now, we are busy preparing for tomorrows programme, he added.                     
	Tomorrow is his brother Durgas first death anniversary.        
	BJPs Jharkhand in-charge Karuna Shukla said she did not attach much significance to what Soren was saying. We are hopeful that he will stick to the decisions taken at a meeting of senior party leaders of the alliance partners, she told The Telegraph over phone from Raipur.        
	Munda, too, refused to attach much importance to what Soren was saying        
	A senior BJP leader said the party was not taking Sorens statement seriously. It is a game being played by the Congress. We will have the upper hand even if the JMM betrays at the eleventh hour, he maintained.        
	The state BJP leader was of the opinion that Sorens comments were aimed at appeasing dissenting MLAs. By saying that the final decision will be taken by the JMM executive committee, Soren has tried to accommodate other party leaders in the crucial decision- making, he pointed out.        
	But senior BJP leader Sarayu Roy, who had played a crucial role in putting Munda in the drivers seat, said it was time to call it quits. We should concentrate on strengthening our organisation instead of forming the government if the JMM continues to change its stand, he told The Telegraph.        
	The Congress in Jharkhand, in the meantime, said the BJP had insulted Soren by forcing him to quit.         
	In a bid to put up a united front in the face of BJPs troubles, the Congress and JVM held a joint press meet to target Munda, saying he was the real villain of the state.         
	Congress leader Radha Krishna Kishore and JVM general secretary Praveen Singh also demanded that the governor ask Munda to parade the MLAs and not rely on the letter of support while inviting him to form the government.         
	In another development, the Supreme Court today refused to give an urgent hearing to the petition filed by JVM chief Babulal Marandi, seeking dismissal of the Soren government for misusing Constitutional provisions.

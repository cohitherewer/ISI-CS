The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mid-year hope for iPad in India
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mid-year hope for iPad in India
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Jan 28: The iPad, Apples touch-screen tablet computer, is expected to reach the Indian shores as early as July-August this year, said industry watchers.         
	However, it will be the non-3G version as high-speed wireless data services are not available in the country now.        
	Apple said international pricing and worldwide availability would be announced later. However, analysts are pegging the Indian price above Rs 25,000.        
	The iPad, unwrapped yesterday in San Francisco by Apple chief executive Steve Jobs, comes in two versions --- one with Wi-Fi and the other with both Wi-Fi and 3G (wireless) capability. Wi-Fi (widely used in India) can be used to access the Internet within a limited area, whereas 3G provides always-on-the-go web access.        
	The iPad can be used for browsing the web, reading e-books, sending and receiving email, viewing photos, watching videos, listening to music and playing games.        
	But the iPad lacks some features common in laptops and phones. A camera is absent, and Flash, the ubiquitous software that handles video and animation on the Web, does not work on the device.        
	According to Apples online enquiry chart, India stands second in volume for questions related to the iPad and 10th for the keyword Apple tablet.        
	There is a lot of curiosity, interest and intent. How much of that can be converted to sales depends on Apple. Pricing, content bundling and applications would all be issues that Apple would have to iron out if it plans to make iPad a success in India, said Diptarup Chakraborti, principal research analyst at Gartner, an IT research and advisory firm.        
	In India, the iPad would not replace the laptops or smartphones, said Rajat Agrawal, editor at the website CellPassion, but will carve out its own distinct category as a companion device that takes mobile social computing to the next level.        
	One of the most significant applications for the iPad may be Apples own creation, called iBooks, an e-reading program that will connect to Apples new online e-bookstore.        
	Jobs said Apple so far had relationships with five major publishers  Hachette, Penguin, HarperCollins, Simon amp; Schuster and Macmillan  and was eager to make deals with others.         
	The real deal, for Indian market, will be when newspapers and magazines can be downloaded to the device and offered free of charge... a challenge for Apple, Agrawal added.        
	Others, however, said Indians no longer shirk paying for online content. The Apple iPhone applications have seen a few million content downloads in the country over the past year.         
	Amazons e-book reader, Kindle -- touted the nearest competitor to the iPad -- is available in India at Rs 18,000. It has to be purchased online and the price includes shipping charges.         
	Comparing the iPad to the Kindle is not appropriate as the iPad has more features than being just an e-book reader, said Chakraborti.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Soren cuts BJP to size
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Soren cuts BJP to size
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Soren                                  
	Ranchi, April 27: Chief minister Shibu Soren sprung a surprise in the Lok Sabha today by supporting the UPA government on the Opposition-sponsored cut motions, a move that left alliance partner BJP stunned and set the ball rolling for possible political realignments in Jharkhand.        
	It is a serious issue and will be discussed at our party forum, Jamshedpur MP Arjun Munda told The Telegraph in Delhi on a day the BJP top brass summoned its ministers from the state to discuss ramifications of Sorens tacit attempts at installing son Hemant as chief minister.        
	Soren, an MP from Dumka, must contest Assembly elections to become an MLA within six months of his swearing in. That deadline ends on June 29, but he has so far been unable to find a safe seat, leading to speculation he was stalling to install son Hemant.        
	P.N Singh and Nishikant Dubey, BJP MPs from Dhanbad and Godda respectively, confirmed that Sorens move had stumped them.         
	The BJP was aware of the numbers game and its (cut motions) only purpose was to expose who stands where on the issue of price rise. So, it would not have made much difference if Soren had abstained, Singh maintained.         
	Sorens move, however, sparked fresh speculation in Ranchi that Guruji had opened up a channel of communication with the Congress with the idea to explore possibilities of joining the hands with it along with Babulal Marandis JVM if the BJP refused to support his move to make Hemant chief minister.        
	JVM general secretary Pravin Singh said Sorens move wasnt surprising as the JMM had contested the Lok Sabha elections with the Congress and had extended support to the UPA government.         
	He never formally withdrew support from the UPA government at the Centre, he pointed out while not ruling out the possibility of forming an alternative government if the BJP withdraws support to the Soren government.

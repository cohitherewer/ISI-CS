	Sept. 16: When a Greek Cypriot named Charles Antoni died at his home in Larnaca in July after a long bout of illness, not too many people in faraway India seemed to have taken note.        
	Few were aware of the role he had played one afternoon 45 years ago in Cambridge, where he then owned an eatery that became the setting for a momentous event in Indias recent political history.         
	Had Varsity Restaurant had an empty table by the window that day in 1965, Sonia Maino might have returned to Italy with a solid grasp of the English language but never having heard the word gherao. And her path never having crossed that of a certain Rajiv Gandhi.        
	It was Antoni, the tall and handsome restaurateur, who had played Cupid for Sonia and Rajiv that day, leading the lonesome Italian teenager past the table where the shy Indian sat and was smitten at first sight.        
	During his (Antonis) illness I spent a lot of time with him and he told me stories about Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi and how he used to tease them, his brother Charillis Zavros told The Telegraph.        
	Antoni, who died in his late 70s, had been ill the past couple of years and had become almost blind but was always keen to hear any news of Sonia and her children, Zavros said.        
	When the Sonia-led Congress returned to power in May 2004, Antoni distributed chocolates.        
	The elderly Greek may not have understood all the news about Sonia he received. In 2006, he posted a letter to her, addressing it to 7 Race Course Road, New Delhi, the Prime Ministers residence.                          
	But Antoni, the romantic, appears to have had little time for details. When Rajiv became Prime Minister, he landed up in Delhi to spend a weekend. He flew in at his own expense but was detained at Delhi airport. He did not have a valid visa.        
	Antoni had a ready explanation: he had not expected a friend of the Gandhis to require a visa. The airport authorities did not take him seriously but allowed him one phone call.        
	Within half an hour, half-a-dozen official Ambassador cars arrived and Antoni was on his way to 7 Race Course Road, happily sipping a cola on the back seat.        
	The Gandhis took good care of him. He spent a magnificent weekend on an island in the Indian Ocean and spent the rest of the week sightseeing in Delhi and Agra.        
	In his last days, Antoni fought the good fight against illness. Charles used to travel to Athens every month to get an eye injection to improve his sight, Zavros said.        
	He was told the chance of improvement was 20 per cent. He said he would try it even if there was just a one per cent chance.        
	He was good at turning chance to success. Like the day a homesick and miserable Sonia, then 18, fetched up at his St Andrew Road restaurant, famous for its moussaka.        
	Antoni knew the girl from Orbassano who had come to study English at the Lennox Cook School of Languages, the most expensive school in Cambridge. She wanted a table by the window and Antoni was sorry to tell her they were all occupied, and led her to another.        
	A few months before his death, Antoni had told this correspondent over the phone what happened next.        
	It was lunchtime. Rajiv was at the round table (table number 11) with a group of friends. As Sonia walked past, Rajiv glanced at her and was smitten. For Sonia, too, it was love at first sight. I sensed that both were mesmerised, he had recalled.        
	Tahir Jahangir, one of the friends sitting with Rajiv, later described how Antoni came to play cupid. He said that when Sonia passed by their table, all conversation halted.                  Charles Antoni      
	Soon the conversation resumed, but I noticed that Rajiv was lost in thought and did not participate. He had a dazed expression. He got hold of a paper napkin and a biro and carefully began to write out a poem on the napkin, the Pakistani national said.        
	He (Rajiv) then called Charles over and asked him to get the best bottle of wine Varsity had. Rajiv then requested Charles to personally go up to the girl, present the bottle of wine, pour it out, and then present the napkin with the poem to the girl and to top it all, belt out an aria!        
	In her book Rajiv, published in 1992, Sonia has given a shorter account, recalling: Our eyes met for the first time directly at a close distance. I could hear my heart pounding. As far as I was concerned, it was love at first sight. He later told me that it was for him too.        
	Zavros who assisted Charles at Varsity when Sonia and Rajiv were seeing each other, said he still remembered them.        
	They were very pleasant and valued customers of Varsity. They were both very polite, generous customers and always willing to talk to us.                    
	Life in Cambridge was fun. Rajiv shared an apartment at 28 Derwent Close with Arun Singh and Deep Kaul, son of former diplomat T.N. Kaul, Pakistani national Mehmood and Anderson, who now runs a successful publishing business in Amsterdam and London.        
	The roommates contributed money to buy a beat-up Volkswagen Beetle.                    Sonia and Rajiv in Darjeeling in 1972      
	Sonia had a local host, a 50-year-old Italian woman called Patina, who lived with her boyfriend Saleem and owned several bed-and-breakfast homes that she offered to students.        
	Sonia stayed at 59 Tennison Row near the station. She also stayed for a short time at 65 Lensfield Road, next to a pub called Spread Eagle.        
	During their Cambridge days, Rajiv and Sonia frequently watched films at the three cinemas in Cambridge. The first movie they saw together was Satyajit Rays Pather Panchali. Rajiv often took Sonia out on the River Cam, their destination one or the other of the riverside counties.        
	The couple were fond of dancing but shared a dislike for alcohol.        
	For quite sometime, though, Sonia had only a hazy idea of Rajivs political links and the premier position the Gandhis enjoyed in India.        
	It was only when a friend showed her a photograph of the visiting Indian Prime Minister one day that she realised that the name Gandhi was almost synonymous with Indian politics of the day.

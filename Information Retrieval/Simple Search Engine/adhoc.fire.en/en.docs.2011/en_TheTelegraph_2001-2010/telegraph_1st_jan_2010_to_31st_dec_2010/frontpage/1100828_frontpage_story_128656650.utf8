	Kolkata, Aug 28 (PTI): Normal life was disrupted in large parts of south Kolkata today due to a strike called by the CPI(M) to protest an alleged attack on their activists by the Trinamool Congress.
    Office-goers had a trying time commuting as transport was seriously affected in large areas of south Kolkata.
    Shops, markets and business establishments remained closed at Santoshpur, Baghajatin, and some parts of Kasba area, officials said.
    No untoward incident has been reported so far, police said.
    At least 22 people, including a CPI(M) MLA and a Trinamool Congress councillor, were yesterday injured in a clash during a borough election under Kolkata Corporation at Baghajatin, which falls under the chief minister's assembly constituency.
    The CPI(M) had called a bandh in two boroughs in wake of the violence.
    Armed police force and Rapid Action Force personnel are patrolling the bandh-hit areas to prevent any further violence.

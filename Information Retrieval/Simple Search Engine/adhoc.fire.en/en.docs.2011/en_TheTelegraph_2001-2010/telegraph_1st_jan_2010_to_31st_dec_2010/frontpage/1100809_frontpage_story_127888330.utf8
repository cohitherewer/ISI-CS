	Berhampur (Orissa), Aug 9 (PTI): About 85,000 people in three south-western districts of Orissa have been affected by flash floods as rivers submerged vast areas following heavy rains, state Revenue and Disaster Management minister S N Patro said here today.
    In 151 villages of the affected blocks, relief camps have been set up and food served to the affected people through community kitchen, Patro told reporters after a visit to the flood-hit districts of Nabarangpur, Kalahandi and Koraput.
    Patra, who was accompanied by Information Technology Minister Ramesh Majhi and Labour minister Puspendra Singhdeo yesterday, said he had asked the district administration to assess the damage as quick as possible he said.
    The affected people would be compensated as per the provisions of the state relief code, he assured.

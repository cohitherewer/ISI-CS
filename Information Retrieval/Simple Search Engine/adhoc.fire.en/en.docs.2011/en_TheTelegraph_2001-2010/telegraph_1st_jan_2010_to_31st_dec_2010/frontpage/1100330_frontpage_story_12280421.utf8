          MEGAN K. STACK                            An injured woman outside Moscows Park Kultury Metro station, one of the blast sites (AFP)                                   
	Moscow, March 29: Two female suicide bombers known as Black Widows blew themselves up on packed subway cars in Moscows city centre this morning, killing at least 37 people and raising the grim spectre of violence creeping back into the symbolic and bureaucratic heart of Russia.        
	The first attack came just before 8am, when a woman set off a suicide bomb just as the doors of the subway carriage slammed shut at Lubyanka station, located near the headquarters of the successor to the Soviet-era KGB.        
	Officials said they suspected that the attack there was intended as a message to the security services, which have helped lead the crackdown on Islamic extremism in Chechnya and other parts of the Caucasus region in southern Russia.                  
	Less than an hour later, the second explosion came. This time the bomber struck at Park Kultury, another iconic station alongside Gorky Park, where Russian children flock for roller-coasters, sprawling gardens and ice-skating.        
	The explosions blasted through the underground at rush hour just as the citys commuters jammed the Metro system on their way to work and school. It was the first such attack in the capital in six years.        
	Investigators were hunting for two women who were captured on surveillance cameras accompanying the two bombers to the doors of the Metro stations.        
	The terrorist acts were carried out by two female terrorist bombers, said Moscows mayor, Yuri M. Luzhkov. They happened at a time when there would be the maximum number of victims.        
	Traffic snarls brought much of the city to a crawl as underground trains were rerouted and frazzled commuters packed themselves into gypsy cabs. Sirens screamed through the streets, and helicopters hovered overhead. Worried family members overloaded some of the citys mobile networks searching for loved ones.        
	Soon, the political ramifications began to unfurl. Obviously, we have not done enough, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told an emergency meeting. We must consider this problem on a national scale, rather than focus on particular means of transportation or particular cities.        
	The explosions come just a few days after the 10th anniversary of Vladimir V. Putins election to the presidency. Now serving as Prime Minister after being forced from the Kremlin by term limits, Putin is still widely seen as Russias top leader.        
	Putins time in power has been marked by struggle with Islamists in the Caucasus. After two recent Chechen wars, the installation of proxy leadership and heavy-handed efforts to squash violence, bloody unrest continues to roil the southern edge of Russia  and raise questions about the governments ability to stabilise the country.        
	The militants receive moral and perhaps financial support from al Qaida. Dozens of contributors to three websites affiliated with al Qaida wrote comments in praise of todays attacks.        
	Officials speculated that the blasts could be revenge after the reported killing this month of Sayed Buryatsky, an Islamist ideologue who was touted as a leader of the anti-government insurgency.        
	New Yorks transit system beefed up security as a precaution following the Moscow bombings.                    THE LOS ANGELES TIMES

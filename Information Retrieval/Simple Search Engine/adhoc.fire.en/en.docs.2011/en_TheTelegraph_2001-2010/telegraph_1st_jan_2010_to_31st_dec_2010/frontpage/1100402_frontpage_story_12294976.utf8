				       LOVE IT OR HATE IT: IF IPAD IS THE BIGGEST POLARISING AGENT IN A DECADE, IT MAKES SENSE TO GO THROUGH TWO REVIEWS      DAVID POGUE                      Steve Jobs with the iPad                          
	In 10 years of reviewing tech products for The New York Times, Ive never seen a product as polarising as Apples iPad, which arrives in US stores on Saturday.        
	This device is laughably absurd, goes a typical remark on a tech blogs comments board. How can they expect anyone to get serious computer work done without a mouse?         
	This truly is a magical revolution, goes another. I cant imagine why anyone will want to go back to using a mouse and keyboard once theyve experienced Apples visionary user interface!         
	Those are some pretty confident critiques of the iPad  considering that their authors have never even tried it.         
	In any case, theres a pattern to these assessments.         
	The haters tend to be techies; the fans tend to be regular people. Therefore, no single write-up can serve both readerships adequately. Theres but one solution: Write separate reviews for these two audiences.         
	Read the first one if youre a techie. (How do you know? Take this simple test. Do you use BitTorrent? Do you run Linux? Do you have more e-mail addresses than pants? Youre a techie.)         
	Read the second review if youre anyone else.               
	For Techies         
	The Apple iPad is basically a gigantic iPod Touch.         
	Its a half-inch-thick slab, all glass on top, aluminum on the back. Hardly any buttons at all  just a big Home button below the screen. It takes you to the Home screen full of apps, just as on an iPhone.         
	You operate the iPad by tapping and dragging on the glass with your fingers, just as on the iPhone. When the very glossy 9.7-inch screen is off, every fingerprint is grossly apparent.                   Apple iPad      
	Theres an e-book reader app, but its not going to rescue the newspaper and book industries (sorry, media pundits). The selection is puny (60,000 titles for now). You cant read well in direct sunlight. At 1.5 pounds, the iPad gets heavy in your hand after awhile (the Kindle is 10 ounces). And you cant read books from the Apple bookstore on any other machine  not even a Mac or iPhone.        
	When the iPad is upright, typing on the on-screen keyboard is a horrible experience; when the iPad is turned 90 degrees, the keyboard is just barely usable (because its bigger). A keyboard dock will be available in April, but then youre carting around two pieces.         
	At least Apple had the decency to give the iPad a really fast processor. Things open fast, scroll fast, load fast. Surfing the Web is a heck of a lot better than on the tiny iPhone screen  first, because its so fast, and second, because you dont have to do nearly as much zooming and panning.         
	But as any Slashdot reader can tell you, the iPad cant play Flash video. Apple has this thing against Flash, the Webs most popular video format; says its buggy, its not secure and depletes the battery. Well, fine, but meanwhile, thousands of Web sites show up with empty white squares on the iPad  places where videos or animations are supposed to play.         
	YouTube and some other sites are converting their videos to iPad/iPhone/Touch-compatible formats. But all the news sites and game sites still use Flash. It will probably be years before the rest of the Webs videos become iPad-viewable.        
	Theres no multitasking, either. Its one app at a time, just like on the iPhone. Plus no USB jacks and no camera. Bye-bye, Skype video chats. You know Apple is just leaving stuff out for next years model.        
	The bottom line is that you can get a laptop for much less money  with a full keyboard, DVD drive, USB jacks, camera-card slot, camera, the works. Besides: If youve already got a laptop and a smartphone, whos going to carry around a third machine?               
	For everyone else              
	The Apple iPad is basically a gigantic iPod Touch.        
	The simple act of making the multi-touch screen bigger changes the whole experience. Maps become real maps, like the paper ones. You see your e-mail inbox and the open message simultaneously. Driving simulators fill more of your field of view, closer to a windshield than a keyhole.         
	The new iBooks e-reader app is filled with endearing grace notes. For example, when you turn a page, the animated page edge actually follows your fingers position and speed as it curls, just like a paper page. Font, size and brightness controls appear when you tap. Tap a word to get a dictionary definition, bookmark your spot or look it up on Google or Wikipedia. Theres even a rotation-lock switch on the edge of the iPad so you can read in bed on your side without fear that the image will rotate.        
	The iPads killer app, though, is killer apps. Apple says that 150,000 existing iPhone apps run on the iPad. They either appear actual size  small and dead centre on the screen  or, with a tap, doubled to fill the screen, a little blurry. Still, all the greats work this way: Dragon Dictation, Skype (even voice calls, through its speaker and microphone) and those gazillion games.        
	But the real fun begins when you try the apps that were specially designed for the iPads bigger screen.        
	That Scrabble app shows the whole board without your zooming or panning: a free companion app for your iPhone or Touch is called Tile Rack; it lets you fiddle with your letters in private, then flick them wirelessly onto the iPads screen. Newspaper apps will reproduce the layout, photos and colors of a real newspaper. The Marvel comic-book app is brilliant in its vividness and panel-by-panel navigation. (Oops, maybe that app belongs in the review for techies.)        
	Hulu.com, the Webs headquarters for free hit TV shows, wont confirm the talk that its working on an iPad app, but wow  can you imagine? A thin, flat, cordless, bottomless source of free, great TV shows, in your bag or on the bedside table?         
	Speaking of video: Apple asserts that the iPad runs 10 hours on a charge of its non-removable battery  but we all know you cant trust the manufacturer. And sure enough, in my own test, the iPad played movies continuously from 7.30am to 7.53 pm  more than 12 hours. Thats four times as long as a typical laptop or portable DVD player.        
	The iPad is so fast and light, the multi-touch screen so bright and responsive, the software so easy to navigate that it really does qualify as a new category of gadget. Some have suggested that it might make a good goof-proof computer for technophobes, the aged and the young; theyre absolutely right.        
	And the techies are right about another thing: the iPad is not a laptop. Its not nearly as good for creating stuff. On the other hand, its infinitely more convenient for consuming it  books, music, video, photos, Web, e-mail and so on. For most people, manipulating these digital materials directly by touching them is a completely new experience  and a deeply satisfying one.        
	The bottom line is that the iPad has been designed and built by a bunch of perfectionists. If you like the concept, youll love the machine.         
	The only question is: Do you like the concept?

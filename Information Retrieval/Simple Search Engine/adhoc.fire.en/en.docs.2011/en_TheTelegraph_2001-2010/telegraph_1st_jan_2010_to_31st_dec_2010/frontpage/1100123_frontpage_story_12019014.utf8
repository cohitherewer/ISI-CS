                                Timeless appeal                            
	London, Jan. 22: Scientists have launched a search for an 80-year-old man who looks like James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery.        
	 The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) said Sir Sean, who turns 80 this summer, was admired for his undimmed appeal in old age. It is aiming to find another equally imposing gentlemen who should share the octogenarian limelight.        
	 The aim is to show the importance of British scientific research and development, currently threatened by 600 million science-funding cuts, in improving the health and fitness of Britain, the RSC said.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

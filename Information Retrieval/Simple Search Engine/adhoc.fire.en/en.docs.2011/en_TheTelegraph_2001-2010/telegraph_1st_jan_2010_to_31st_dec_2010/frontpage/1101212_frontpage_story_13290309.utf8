The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Business tag on Buddha fair 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Business tag on Buddha fair 
          A STAFF REPORTER                             Sen (left), Bhattacharjee                                 
	Calcutta , Dec. 11: Industries minister Nirupam Sen today suggested that the Calcutta Book Fair was a commercial venture and did not necessarily deserve a tariff subsidy, appearing to take a stand contrary to that of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, regarded as the events guardian angel.         
	They only do business there, Sen said today in response to a question if the Book Fair was a business venture like any other fair.         
	Sens reply, which he qualified by pointing out that the final decision on the subsidy had not yet been taken, strikes at the root of the governments stand so far which advocated special treatment for the event.         
	Bhattacharjee, who had once said the Book Fair could not be seen purely as a business because books help develop readers intellect, had backed the event so much that he risked a legal loss of face and opposed the shifting of the venue from the Maidan, the lungs of the city. The government eventually lost out and the high court ordered that the Maidan could not be used for such events.         
	Sen today indicated his reluctance to cut the rent for the 12-day fair  to be held at the Milan Mela ground from January 26  as the Publishers and Booksellers Guild had requested.         
	We have invested a lot in the fairground. Besides, there is the cost of maintaining the ground throughout the year. Prices are going up too, Sen said but added: We are looking into the matter and nothing has been decided.         
	He said he had asked his departments secretary to have another look at the guilds plea.         
	Guild secretary Tridib Chatterjee said: We are shocked at the governments reaction and expect it to review the decision.         
	He cited Bhattacharjees stand, saying: Earlier, the chief minister had never considered the fair to be a business venture and had always extended a helping hand. In 2007 and 2008, the state government had allowed the Book Fair to be organised free of cost at Salt Lake stadium.         
	Even last year, at Bhattacharjees behest, the government had slashed the Milan Mela rent from Rs 62 lakh to Rs 37 lakh for the fair, prompting the guild to publicly thank the chief minister.         
	Chatterjee said the guild had waived the entry fee for the upcoming Book Fair as a tribute to Rabindranath Tagore in his 150th year.         
	We have scrapped the entry fee and requested the government to offer us a discount, another official said.

	Imphal, May 8: The Regional Institute of Medical Sciences here today said it would suspend routine operations from Monday because of scarcity of oxygen, the supply of which has been cut off as Manipurs lifelines, Imphal-Dimapur and Imphal-Jiribam highways, are blocked.        
	We have no alternative other than stopping routine operations from Monday till the supply resumes. The stock of oxygen and lifesaving drugs is very low. But we will perform emergency operations, RIMS superintendent Y. Mohen said.         
	Manipur is reeling under acute scarcity of commodities, particularly fuel, oxygen and cooking gas, and resultant skyrocketing of prices.         
	The supply of essential commodities was reduced to a trickle after the All Naga Students Association, Manipur, imposed an indefinite economic blockade along the two highways on April 11. Some supplies, however, could be brought to Imphal three days a week through the Imphal-Dimapur highway with the help of security escorts.         
	The supplies, however, have completely stopped since May 5 when vehicles coming from Kohima were not allowed to proceed beyond Dimapur by people in Nagaland in protest against the Okram Ibobi Singh governments decision not to allow NSCN (I-M) general secretary Th. Muivah to enter Manipur.        
	Police deployed at Mao checkgate in Senapati district of Manipur also stopped vehicles coming from Nagaland on May 6, the day Muivah had planned to enter Manipur through Mao Gate. The situation worsened that day after Nagas in Senapati district completely blocked the Imphal-Dimapur highway by putting boulders and trees along a 35km stretch from Kangpokpi to Mao town after the police fired on protesters at Mao, leading to the death of two students and injury to many. Ibobi Singh rushed reinforcements to Mao that afternoon but the team could not reach the town because of the roadblocks. The team headed by Kh. Chandramani Singh, the commandant of 7 Manipur Rifles, is now camping at Kangpokpi police station.        
	The government called in the army yesterday. The GOC, 57 Mountain Division, Maj. Gen. D.S. Hooda, made an aerial survey of Senapati today.        
	Government spokesperson N. Biren Singh said the Imphal-Dimapur highway would be reopened in the next few days with army help. We have taken steps for the supply to resume soon, he said.        
	In the meantime, the price of petrol, which costs Rs 46.43 a litre, has gone up to Rs 150 a litre while that of diesel, which costs Rs 35.05 a litre, is now between Rs 80 and Rs 90 a litre. The price of cooking gas varies between Rs 800 and Rs 900 per cylinder though the actual price is Rs 321.4 per cylinder. As a result, the fares of buses, taxis and auto-rickshaws have spiralled. Prices of foodgrains and edible oils have gone up by Rs 10 to Rs15 a kg/litre.        
	The non-availability of diesel has hit water supply at RIMS, affecting the functioning of the institute. The supplier who provides six to seven tankers to RIMS every day has stopped supply, as he cannot run his vehicles. Mohen said some doctors had stopped coming because of non-availability of petrol for their vehicles. Services in other hospitals, including private ones, have also been affected. Sources said senior officials were not coming to offices for the past three days because of non-availability of petrol.         
	IGP (law and order-III) V. Zathang, who heads the police team at Mao, said their rations were running out. We are managing with the existing stocks, but they are running out, he said over phone.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Asiad snub to Games boss
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Asiad snub to Games boss
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, July 31: The Centre has rebuffed a unilaterally initiated bid by Suresh Kalmadi to hold the 2019 Asian Games in Delhi, mainly to cut the controversial Commonwealth Games chief organiser to size but also led by a fledgling ambition to host the 2020 Olympics.        
	The sports ministry has rejected the Kalmadi-led Indian Olympic Associations (IOAs) request for a Rs 15-crore grant to start its campaign for hosting the Asiad, postponed for a year from 2018 by the Olympic Council of Asia, sources said.        
	The move comes amid reports of rampant corruption in organising the October Commonwealth Games. Officials said the Centre did not want a repeat of the mess during the Asiad, nor was it willing to let Kalmadi get away with foisting a fait accompli on the government.        
	The sources said the IOA had quietly bid for the 2019 Asiad, informing the sports ministry only after the expiry of the June 30 bidding deadline to seek the mandatory government approval.        
	Also, the Centre is thinking of bidding for the 2020 Olympics next year and believes hosting the Asiad in 2019 could get in the way of preparations if India wins the bid in the 2013 voting.        
	The sources said the ministry rejected the IOAs demand for Rs 15 crore saying, among other things, that it was not satisfied with the expenditure projections. One reason for the snub, the sources said, is sports minister M.S. Gills desire to see Congress politician Kalmadi out of the IOA, where he has ruled since 1996, before next years Olympic bid.         
	The controversy around the Commonwealth Games has sullied the IOAs image. We need a more dynamic, fresh face to lead our (Olympic) bid, an official said.        
	Kalmadis current and fourth term expires only in 2012 but the government may move a bill in winter seeking to restrict the number of terms a person can have at a sports bodys helm to two, the sources said.        
	Today, the cabinet secretary cancelled a visit to the Commonwealth Games headquarters after reports of irregularities in the award of contracts and the poor quality of event-related projects.         
	Sports ministry officials said a member of UK Prime Minister David Camerons team, which included sports minister Jeremy Hunt and 2012 Olympics chief organiser and athletics icon Sebastian Coe, had privately expressed surprise at the calm pace of the preparations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Raja loses throne amp; bluster 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Raja loses throne amp; bluster 
  - PM takes a stand, Jaya   card forces DMK hand         G.C. SHEKHAR AND RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      A. Raja                                      
	Nov. 14: Telecom minister A. Raja resigned tonight after Jayalalithaas open offer of support worked to the advantage of the Prime Minister in turning around an initially belligerent DMK.        
	The exit of a minister belonging to a powerful ally on corruption charges signals the widening of a clean-up operation that has so far remained confined to the Congress. It also marks the accomplishment of a task Manmohan Singh had to leave unfinished when he returned to power last year.        
	The Prime Minister is believed to have had indicated privately to the Congress leadership at a core group meeting earlier in the day that the continuation of Raja in the cabinet would reflect adversely on the image of his government. Some Congress leaders were not keen on pushing the DMK beyond a point.        
	Singh was reluctant to include Raja in his cabinet to begin with because of his tainted image. The Prime Ministers reluctance had led to a stand-off between the Congress and the DMK last summer, delaying the completion of cabinet formation by several days.        
	However, with Singh making his mind clear, Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee and P. Chidambaram spoke to M. Karunanidhi and urged him to help defuse the crisis  in effect, let Raja go.        
	Sources in Chennai said Karunanidhi, who had been backing Raja vocally over the past few days, met Raja today for a second time in less than 24 hours to arrive at the decision to relent.        
	The two held discussions with the DMKs parliamentary party leader, T.R. Baalu, and Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi this afternoon to chalk out an appropriate exit plan.         
	Raja, 47, who returned to Delhi this evening accompanied by textiles minister Dayanidhi Maran and Karunanidhis daughter Kanimozhi, struck a defiant posture at Chennai airport.         
	There is no question of me resigning, he told reporters before his departure. Asked if he was going to put in his papers, Raja said: There is nothing like that. CM (Karunanidhi) has not told me anything (about resigning).        
	However, soon after reaching Delhi, Raja went to the Prime Ministers house to put in his papers. In order to avoid embarrassment to the government and maintain peace and harmony in Parliament, my leader has advised me to resign, he told PTI.        
	The sources said the DMK had set two conditions  Raja would not be dropped but would step down on his own and that he would be allowed to return if no wrongdoing was established.        
	Other sources said the DMK also wanted Rajas vacancy to be filled by another party nominee  something on which the Congress has not yet given any assurance. ( )        
	 The sources said the Congress itself might stake claim to the berth. Senior Tamil Nadu Congress leader E.V.K.S. Elangovan, who has been publicly demanding the ouster of Raja, said: The DMK should not be given the same portfolio of communication and information technology. It will not be proper if a rani replaces this Raja.        
	Asked if she would replace Raja, Kanimozhi said: You are talking to a member of Parliament who will continue to be an MP.        
	The DMK leadership, after stoutly refusing to buckle down at first, chose to relent later for two reasons. First, the leadership did not want to strain its ties with the Congress ahead of next years Assembly elections because of the Raja imbroglio.         
	Now that the Congress has spurned Jayalalithaas overtures and asserted that we are its preferred ally and left the decision on Raja to our leader, we are reciprocating that gesture, reasoned a DMK minister.         
	The DMK also wanted the spectrum controversy to subside well ahead of the Assembly elections in the summer.

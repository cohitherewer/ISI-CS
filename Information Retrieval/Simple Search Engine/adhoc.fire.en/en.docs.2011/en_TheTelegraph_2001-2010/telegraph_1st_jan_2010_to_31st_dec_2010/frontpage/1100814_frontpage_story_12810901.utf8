          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: India has refused to accept currency paper shipments from one of its biggest suppliers in Britain because of uneven production standards that could compromise the quality of printed rupee notes.        
	The quality controversy at De La Rue, the worlds biggest banknote printer, appears to have forced its chief executive James Hussey to step down today.        
	Sources said the problem with the currency paper manufactured at De La Rues main plant in Overton, Hampshire, was that a coating given to it after implanting security features was peeling off during the production process itself. The RBI and De La Rue have declined comment on the nature of the problem.        
	In July, the paper maker told an Indian inspection team which went to London that it would not be able to despatch the shipment because of quality concerns, the sources said. The team was not allowed to carry out quality checks.        
	De La Rue has, however, maintained in a statement that neither the physical security nor the security features incorporated in the paper have been compromised for any customer.        
	India has not yet cancelled its contract with the firm that supplies about 40-45 per cent of its needs, but sources said the deal could be in jeopardy. The RBI contract apparently contributes a quarter of De La Rues 96.6-million pre-tax profits.        
	There is speculation that this could be one of the main reasons for Husseys resignation. In a statement, De La Rue said his decision stemmed from certain quality and production irregularities at one of its paper production facilities and his belief that he must take responsibility for this.        
	The 189-year-old security paper maker and printer serves over 150 world currencies and the quality issue could have an impact on its reputation. For India, the problem is bigger as a break in De La Rue supplies could trigger a shortage of notes.        
	India generally keeps a six months stock of blank currency notes. But if its biggest supplier is dogged by production problems, it will have no option but to find another. This is not easy because other manufacturers would have tied up production schedules at the start of the year. The other option would be to cut back on note printing.        
	Security agencies said any scarcity of notes could be exploited by Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence to push in more fakes. They said the ISI appears to have been able to buy paper with security features and print duplicates.        
	In a letter last year, the RBI had warned PSUs and private sector banks that fake Rs 1,000 notes in the series 2 AQ and 8 AC had new, strengthened security features like optically variable ink, colour shift, security thread etc, ... very much akin to genuine notes.        
	Currency paper is different from normal paper in that it has security features: visible ones like holograms and threads, and those not apparent to the naked eye that come from mixing a kind of rare earth with the paper pulp.

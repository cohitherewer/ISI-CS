The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Left lines up parting kick to education
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Left lines up parting kick to education
          MITA MUKHERJEE                              
	Calcutta, July 23: The Left Front is set to deal its latest blow to the states education system in an attempt to win votes in rural Bengal, through a move that will raise the salaries of thousands of teachers but may doom their students to an inferior status for ever.        
	It will create parallel primary and secondary education boards to be run by the panchayat and rural development department, which has no expertise for the job, in a move unparalleled in the country.        
	The government has pulled out the stops to get the panchayat education bill cleared by governor M.K. Narayanan and expects to enact it in the ongoing monsoon session of the Assembly.        
	The bill proposes two new education boards under the panchayat and rural development department, one for the 16,108 sishu siksha kendras (SSKs) that hold classes from I to IV and the other for the 1,917 Madhyamik siksha kendras (MSKs) that run classes from V to VIII.        
	The move will regularise over 55,000 teachers jobs at the siksha kendras, raise their pay and create employment at the new boards. But it will introduce an iron-cast caste system in education, threatening to jeopardise the siksha kendra students chances of enrolling in Class IX in other schools in the future.        
	This is unheard of. I think this is suicidal What will happen to the upward mobility of the students passing out of the SSKs and MSKs? asked Pabitra Sarkar, an academic known for his Left leanings.        
	From framing the syllabi to appointing teachers, the panchayat bodies will manage the entire show How will they ensure quality? another pro-Left academic asked.        
	The siksha kendras were set up under the Centres Sarva Siksha Abhiyan that aims to get children aged 6-14 into school. The Centre had directed the states to run the siksha kendras jointly by the panchayat and school education departments, but unlike other states, Left-ruled Bengal kept the kendras solely under the panchayat department.        
	So, whereas in other states the siksha kendra students study the same syllabus as those under these states school boards, in Bengal they pursue a different curriculum set by the panchayat department.        
	What the bill does is institutionalise this arrangement, removing all hope that the school education department could be involved in future to help lift the siksha kendras out of their predicament, academics said.        
	The bill is unclear on whether and how SSK and MSK students can switch over to schools of other boards.        
	In principle, a future non-Left government could scrap the bill and undo the damage, but the bills populist implications are likely to deter them.        
	School education department sources said the governor had raised objections earlier this month after receiving the draft bill.        
	In a letter, the governor said the rules of business of the panchayat department did not allow it to handle education-related responsibilities. So he wanted amendments to the rules of business if the government was eager to pass the bill, a source said.        
	He added: The changes have already been made and the governor is likely to give his assent in a day or two.        
	Officially, the bill aims at improving the academic and administrative functioning of the SSKs and MSKs, which together have over 18 lakh students. It will lead to job regularisation for the 46,051 siksha sahayikas (casual teachers) in the SSKs and the 10,144 siksha samprasarikas (casual teachers) in the MSKs. Siksha kendra teachers monthly salaries will rise from Rs 2,000 to at least Rs 12,000, on a par with those of other schoolteachers.        
	Early last year, the bill had been vetoed even by Alimuddin Street, which had previously had no scruples about ruining Bengals education system by withdrawing English till Class V or by allowing transfer of teachers from Presidency College and the appointment of party men in key positions. But the recent poll setbacks changed the partys mind.        
	Students should not have any problem as the syllabi and courses offered by the proposed boards will be equivalent to those of the normal state primary and secondary school boards, said Anisur Rahman, the panchayat and rural development minister.

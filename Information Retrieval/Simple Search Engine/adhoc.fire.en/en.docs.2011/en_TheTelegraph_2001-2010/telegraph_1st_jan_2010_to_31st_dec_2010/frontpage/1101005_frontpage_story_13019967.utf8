                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Principal, 3 teachers held in caning case
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 4: The principal of La Martiniere for Boys and three other teachers of the school were arrested this morning in the Rouvanjit Rawla case.        
	The principal and the teachers were granted bail in the afternoon on a surety of Rs 500 each.        
	The Class VIII boy had committed suicide on February 12, four days after being caned by the principal, Sunirmal Chakravarthi, for indiscipline. His father Ajay Rawla lodged a complaint with Shakespeare Sarani police station four months later, accusing the principal and some teachers of physical and mental torture that drove Rouvanjit to death.        
	The charges filed against the four do not mention abetment to suicide. Chakravarthi was charged under Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means.        
	The section is bailable but if the charge is proved, the offence carries imprisonment of up to three years, or with fine or both.        
	Around 6.30am, Chakravarthi and the head of the middle school, L.J. Gunnion, were picked up from the staff quarters at the schools 11 Loudon Street campus. David Ryan and Partha Dutta, too, were picked up from their homes.        
	They were charged under the Juvenile Justice Act 23, which relates to torture of a child by the custodian of the place/institution where he or she has been staying when the alleged crime took place, a non-bailable, cognisable offence.        
	Since this is a cognisable offence, the arrest of the accused is mandatory, said Damayanti Sen, the head of the detective department.        
	Asked about the timing of the arrest, two days before the school gives over for the Puja holidays, sources in Lalbazar said the investigation was over and the chargesheet was ready to be submitted today.         
	Chakravarthi and the three others were taken to the police headquarters at Lalbazar and then to Bankshall court.        
	The school management sent out a signal of solidarity. They have been granted bail. All of them will carry out their duties as before. There is no question of suspending any of them because they have not been taken into custody, said Supriyo Dhar, the secretary to the board of governors, La Martiniere Schools. The arrest will not in anyway disturb classes or any other school activity, he added.        
	Ajay Rawla said in Singapore, where he has shifted base: This is a miscarriage of justice. All the sections are bailable and there is no mention of abetment to suicide. We will see how to take it forward. I am going to take this to its logical conclusion.        
	Earlier in the day before bail was granted, Rawla had reacted differently at the news of the arrest. I had almost given up hope. But my faith in the system has been restored.        
	The board of governors of the school will meet tomorrow morning to decide on the course of action.

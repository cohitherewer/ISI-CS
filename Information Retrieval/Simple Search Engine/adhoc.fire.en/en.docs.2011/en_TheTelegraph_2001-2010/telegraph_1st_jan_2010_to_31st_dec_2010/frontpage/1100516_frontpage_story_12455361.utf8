	Srinagar, May 16 (PTI): A multi-cordon security blanket will be thrown to thwart any terrorist plot during the two-month-long Amarnath Yatra beginning July one.  
	The Yatra to the cave, which houses the naturally-formed ice Shivlingam at a height of 3,880 metres in the south Kashmir Himalayas, is expected to draw nearly four lakh pilgrims from across the country. quot;Fidayeen or no fidayeen, we will ensure that the Yatra takes place peacefully. If militants try to disturb peace, we will hunt them down, quot; Inspector General (Kashmir) of CRPF P V K Reddy told a visiting group of journalists.  
	The multi-cordon security blanket will be thrown along the Yatra route. While the Indian Army is to man the heights to prevent any infiltration from the mountains, BSF personnel will guard the trek route. The safety of the camps put up for the pilgrims for night halts will be handled by CRPF jawans.

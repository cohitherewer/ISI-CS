The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | School bags to weigh less
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                School bags to weigh less
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 6: Indias largest chain of public schools has directed its principals to stringently enforce new norms laying down the maximum weight of school bags, in a move that could pressure other schools into following suit.         
	In a directive to all its schools, the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has also threatened principals with action if they fail to enforce the new school bag weight norms.         
	It will be the responsibility of the principal to ensure compliance of the instructions and he/she will be held responsible in case of non-compliance, the order warns.         
	The central government-run KVS has over a 1,000 schools spread across the country and in a few countries abroad.         
	Under the new norms, central school principals must ensure that the total weight of textbooks and notebooks does not exceed 2kg  including the bag  for students of classes I and II.         
	The admissable weight limit is 3kg for students of classes III and IV, 4kg for classes V-VII and 6kg for higher classes, under the new KVS norms notified in December.         
	Parents and students across India have for years complained about heavy school bags weighing down children. The heavy bags have also become a metaphor for the intense academic pressure the countrys school system is perceived to be placing on students.         
	Diverse studies on school bag weights conducted by different NGOs across the country have found the average weight carried by a student to a school to range beteen 6kg and 10kg.         
	Internationally, most countries observe norms that limit the weight of school bags to less than one-seventh of the weight of the student.         
	This is the first occasion that a set of institutions has imposed weight norms for school bags. We hope it will pressurise other schooling systems  both government and private  to follow suit, a KVS source said.         
	The KVS directive also lists a set of measures that schools can follow to succesfully enforce the norms.         
	Classrooms can have lockers where students can leave textbooks they do not need to take home for homework, the directive suggests. Homework should be limited to three subjects on a particular day, the directive suggests.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, Jan. 27: A surrendered Ulfa militant today claimed that the outfits leaders who went missing during Operation All Clear in Bhutan in 2003 were killed in Shillong by security forces and two Congress leaders took the initiative in their murder.        
	Kamal Nath, the surrendered militant and an accused in the Daniel Topno murder case, was today produced at a court in Tezpur where he revealed this to reporters.         
	Daniel Topno, a schoolteacher and a leader of the Assam Tea Tribes Students Association of Gohpur, was killed by unidentified assailants on September 27, 2000, at Chatrang in Sonitpur.         
	Kamal said all the 11 missing Ulfa men, many of them senior leaders including central committee members Bening Rabha and Ashanta Bagphukan, were captured from Bhutan by security forces and were taken to Shillong where they were killed.         
	Nath, however, did not name the Congress leaders.

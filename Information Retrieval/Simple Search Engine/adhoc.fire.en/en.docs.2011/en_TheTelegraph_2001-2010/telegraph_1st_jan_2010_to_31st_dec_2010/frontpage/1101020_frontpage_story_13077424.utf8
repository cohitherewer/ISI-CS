  - Vigilance to summon NGOC office-bearers for questioning          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA AMP; RUDRA BISWAS                       RK Anand                                
	Ranchi, Oct. 19: As the state vigilance bureau prepares to summon National Games Organising Committee (NGOC) working chairman R.K. Anand and other office-bearers for questioning, the state government and NGOC are busy petitioning Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to set a fresh schedule for holding the jinxed 34th National Games in January or February 2011.         
	Steps are being taken to summon all three NGOC office-bearers and the then director of sports for interrogation in connection with the FIR filed against them by the vigilance bureau earlier this month. We intend to speed up investigations, IG (vigilance) M.V. Rao told The Telegraph.        
	On October 6, the bureau had lodged FIRs against Anand, NGOC organising secretary S.M. Hashmi, treasurer Madhukant Pathak and P.C. Mishra, the then director of sports, and others, for corruption, misuse of official position and embezzlement of public funds in purchase of equipment and construction of infrastructure for the proposed Games in Ranchi. They were charged under Indian Penal Code Sections 120(B),109, 420, 406, 409, 467, 468, 471 and under Section 13(2) and 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.        
	Speaking over phone from Delhi, Anand today told The Telegraph that a letter had been written to IOA president Suresh Kalmadi yesterday for allotting fresh dates for the Games. The letter was jointly signed by chief minister and NGOC chairman Arjun Munda and Anand.        
	Earlier, Munda had urged the IOA to postpone the Games slated between December 9 and 22 to January-February for the panchayat elections. The 34th National Games, originally scheduled for November 2007, has already been postponed six times.        
	Anand said the government should hold the panchayat elections but simultaneously complete preparations for the Games. He added that he had already submitted a list of requirements for holding the Games to the sports secretary.        
	When asked to comment on the FIR, Anand, a lawyer, said there was nothing mala fide on the part of the state government in lodging an FIR with the vigilance bureau for the alleged financial bungling.        
	Section 154 of CrPC requires the bureau to lodge an FIR to start investigations into charges levelled against a person. If the bureau finds the evidence substantial, then only it registers the case under Section 182 of the CrPC, he pointed out.                          
	I have nothing to worry. All purchases were made by the government, he added.        
	The FIRs were lodged after the state law department gave the go-ahead to the bureau to probe the charges levelled by the secretary of the State Wrestling Association, Bhola Nath Singh. In his complaint, Singh alleged flouting of financial rules in purchase of sports equipment without floating tenders, purchase of equipment much in excess of actual requirements and at prices many times higher than actual market prices, purchase of electronic score boards from a single supplier at varying rates and granting of mobilisation advances to parties without obtaining bank guarantees.         
	Anand said 90 per cent of the sports equipment had been procured. Now, the officials have to work at the ground level to procure the rest 10 percent. We dont want to get a bad name like the IOA office-bearers who drew a lot of flak for the Commonwealth Games, he said.        
	The chief minister, during a review meeting on September 23, had been shocked to learn that the venue for the equestrian event was yet to be decided. Terraflex for volleyball and basketball indoor stadiums were also not ready while construction of approach roads was far from complete. The chief minister had asked the sports department to immediately approach the Vigilance Bureau and request it to complete the probe into the allegations clouding the National Games.

	Ranchi, Oct. 4: The Arjun Munda government today posted as many 150 officials in remote blocks, many of which were without administrative heads for years, in an effort to ensure governance reached the districts that are scheduled to hold panchayat elections by the end of the year.        
	Announcing the postings of a host of block development officers, district panchayati raj officers, district welfare officers, district transport officers, deputy collectors land revenue (DCLR), district and block level supply officers, among others, chief secretary A.K. Singh said it was for the first time in the history of Jharkhand that all administrative positions at lower levels of governance would be filled.        
	Eighty-four of the deputy collectors posted today are freshers who have only now completed their first round of training after being recommended by Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC). Postings of these officials would boost the pace of development in the concerned blocks, Singh told The Telegraph.        
	Chief secretary Singh added that filling up vacant posts was necessary for the smooth conduct of panchayat polls. Besides, the government sops to mitigate the effect of drought in the state will also be effectively implemented, the chief secretary said, adding that newly-appointed block supply officers would have the onus of overseeing the public distribution system.         
	Rural development secretary Santosh Kumar Satpathy welcomed the state governments move, adding that as many as 82 of the over 250 blocks in the state were without BDOs for long.        
	Sources said Munda, who returned from Jamshedpur late last night, reviewed the vacancies himself before posting orders were issued.         
	The chief minister spent the better part of the day clearing files in his Project Building office.         
	State personnel department secretary Aditya Swaroop said they were busy preparing a list of officials and their place of postings, indicating a sense of urgency in the Munda government to fill all vacant posts, be it in the bureaucracy or in state run institutions like hospitals and medical centres.        
	In that connection, Singh also held a crucial meeting with Alok Sengupta, the chairman of JPSC, and senior officials of several government departments to try and expedite appointments of doctors, engineers and others.        
	JPSC, which was at the centre of a controversy over malpractices during the tenure of former chairman Dilip Kumar Prasad and members against whom a vigilance probe is on, is desperately looking for a clean-up. The state, too, is trying its best.        
	But to the severe crisis of credibility, the JPSC is also hampered by a staff crunch to carry out recruitment activities. Posts of secretary and deputy secretary are lying vacant, even as the controller of examinations expressed his unwillingness to be a part of any examination process as his wards were scheduled to appear for forthcoming tests conducted by the commission.        
	The chief secretary said the state had found a way out and within a week or so, JPSC was likely to advertise for the posts.         
	Recently, the state formed a staff selection commission, which was entrusted with the task of holding examinations/interviews for selecting candidates in non-gazetted posts. But recruitments are yet to start.

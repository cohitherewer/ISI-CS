  - One minister wants to dress down, another dresses up for the market        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                 
	New Delhi, April 2: For the first time the government intends to fund higher educational institutions with money raised from the market.        
	The human resource development ministry under Kapil Sibal is finalising plans to issue bonds through a proposed National Education Finance Corporation (NEFC), which will lend to higher educational institutions, officials told The Telegraph.        
	Under the plan presented by the ministry before Sibal this week, the bonds will be gift-wrapped with tax exemptions and other attractions to tempt buyers. The ministry plans to approach the finance ministry for approval soon.        
	The market will be one of three sources of funding for the NEFC, which is otherwise modelled on financial institutions such as Nabard, which offers loans at low interest rates for social interest projects and has raised money through bonds and term deposits.        
	The ministry is proposing a Rs 2,000-crore annual budget for the NEFC and plans to tap the higher education cess that the government has charged since 2008-09, apart from funds drawn from the market.         
	It is the move to issue bonds to raise funds from the market that is likely to attract the spotlight in the days to come because it has no precedent. Some politicians allergic to the market might find the proposal unpalatable.        
	The move showcases both the shortage of funds the government faces and the willingness of the ministry under Sibal to explore novel methods of funding that are unlikely to have received his predecessor Arjun Singhs approval.         
	India has 480 universities and about 22,000 colleges. But these institutions have helped the country register a gross higher education enrolment rate of just over 12 per cent. The country needs an additional 800 universities and close to 35,000 colleges to raise the enrolment rate to 30 per cent  the target set by Sibal for the next 10 years.         
	The NEFC is proposed to act as a lending agent to encourage governments and private sector groups to set up higher educational institutions  much like Nabard has done for rural entrepreneurs.         
	The funds from the higher education cess are also likely to contribute significantly to the kitty that the NEFC will draw on to lend to institutions.        
	The Centre started levying a 2 per cent school education cess on all taxes from 2005 to fund its expansion of primary education programmes under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the mid-day meal scheme.        
	Starting 2008-09, the government levied an additional 1 per cent cess calculated on taxable income.         
	The 1 per cent cess is meant for secondary and higher education but the money collected this way over the past two years is lying completely unused, HRD ministry sources said.        
	Now, the ministry plans to split the funds collected through the 1 per cent cess into two equal shares  one for secondary education expansion and the other for the NEFC, the sources said.

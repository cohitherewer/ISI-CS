          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: Indias MPs, whose salaries were hiked threefold yesterday, can hope to be paid even more.        
	The government today promised a fresh look at their salaries and allowances, dousing a threat by some parties to disrupt Parliament over yesterdays inadequate raise.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee met BJP, Samajwadi Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) floor leaders this morning and pledged a review of the salary decision after wider consultations with MPs and parties.        
	Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal, however, clarified that the government had not actually promised a further hike. But, asked if the Centre was open to a re-look, he said: In a democracy, you have to consider the opinions expressed by MPs, but no decision has been taken yet.        
	The cabinet had rejected a House panels recommendation of Rs 80,001 a month. Instead, it increased MPs salary to Rs 50,000 a month from the current Rs 16,000, prompting the Samajwadis and the RJD to kick up a storm over the insufficient raise.        
	Government sources hinted that the salary bill would be reworked and that a further pay rise was being considered. Even if the salary is not raised to Rs 80,001, the sources indicated, efforts would be made for a substantial increase. There is a strong possibility of the MPs already hefty allowances being raised too.        
	Although the government feels the salary row is reflecting badly on the political class and should be wound up at the earliest, the bill will be tabled only on the last day of this session, which is to be extended at least till August 31.         
	Pranab today met political leaders to break the deadlock over two issues: the pay hike and the Centres move to have the bill on the Medical Council of India passed amid the din over salary.        
	Some parties had yesterday held a mock Lok Sabha session and condemned the decision to pass the medical council bill  which allows the Centre to virtually take over the scandal-ridden council  without a debate. They had decided to continue to disrupt the House on both issues.        
	The morning meeting was attended by Rajya Sabha Opposition leader Arun Jaitley, Samajwadi leader Mulayam Singh Yadav, RJD chief Lalu Prasad, Janata Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav and the BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Gopinath Munde.        
	They pressed for a hike to Rs 80,001 and demanded reversal of the medical council bills passage. Pranab said the medical council bill could not be reversed but mollified the parties by offering a House debate on the legislation.        
	Munde later said: We have left it (the salary hike) to Pranabbabu. Whatever decision he takes after discussions will be acceptable to us.        
	Sharad said the Centres promise had resolved the salary issue but did not mention a figure.        
	Most Congress and BJP MPs too favour a further hike though they have not openly expressed or supported the demand, sources said.         
	They said Speaker Meira Kumar was extremely upset at the BJP, Samajwadis and the RJD for holding the mock Parliament and wanted to issue a statement, but was advised against it.

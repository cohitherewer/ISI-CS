The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mahanta fires LoC salvo at CM
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mahanta fires LoC salvo at CM
  - Ex-chief minister asks Gogoi if he heeds court orders passed in his favour          A STAFF REPORTER                                              Mahanta      
	Guwahati, July 7: Former Assam chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta today went all out against his successor Tarun Gogoi over the threat to reopen the letter of credit (LoC) scam case, seeking to know whether Gogoi had gone through the court orders passed in favour of Mahanta.        
	In a tone mocking at times, Mahanta asked at a press meet convened to clarify his position vis--vis the LoC case: I have just one basic question for the chief minister, who was himself a senior lawyer,  does he accept court orders or not? Did I manage the courts, too, like the governor Lt Gen. (retd) S.K. Sinha, as alleged by him (Gogoi)?         
	The arrival of AGP leaders Chandra Mohan Patowary and Phani Bhushan Choudhury, for the lunch that followed the press meet, conveyed that the party was solidly behind Mahanta, who has been especially targeted by the Gogoi government over secret killings and the LoC case.         
	Patowary said the AGP was preparing for the July 13 Dispur chalo programme against the governments anti-people moves.         
	The LoC case returned to centrestage after Gogoi and government spokespersons spoke of getting the case reopened, as there was allegedly a prima facie case against Mahanta, who had allegedly escaped prosecution, as the then governor, Gen. Sinha, did not accord sanction to the CBI to prosecute him. They said the Cabinet would take the final call, but its last two meetings, it is understood, have not discussed the case.         
	While Gen. Sinha reacted by asking Gogoi to go through his book, Guarding Indias Integrity, to know why he did not accord prosecution sanction to CBI, Mahanta, armed with an exhaustive write-up and court orders suggesting he had no role whatsoever in the case, went on the offensive this afternoon.         
	He dared the chief minister to reopen the Manabendra Sarma murder case, the ASCARD Bank scam case in which the CBI had sought permission to prosecute a former minister, or the Chandmari case. Or why has Gogoi not handed over the probe into the murder of journalists Prahlad Gowala and Anil Mazumdar to the CBI? he asked.         
	He is doing all this to divert attention from the Rs 1,000 crore scam in NC Hills. During my tenure, several ministers had to be dropped on charges of corruption, but they returned when nothing was proved against them. What is stopping Gogoi from taking such a step? Mahanta asked.

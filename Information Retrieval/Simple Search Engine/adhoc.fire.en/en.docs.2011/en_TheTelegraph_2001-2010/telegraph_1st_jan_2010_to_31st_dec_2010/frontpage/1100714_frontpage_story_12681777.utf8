  - Anti-Cong boss asks state unit to fend for itself          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with Prakash Karat in Calcutta on Tuesday.   (Picture by Amit Datta)                                
	Calcutta, July 13: Prakash Karat today did to the Left Front what Mark Antony had done with far more rhetorical flourish to Brutus, praising the Bengal alliance but only to hammer home the message that it had to fend for itself in the elections next year.        
	The CPM boss also made the task more arduous for the state unit by denying the local leaders a comfort zone they had been yearning for: Karat stuck to his line of opposing the Congress, although he drew a distinction between the erstwhile ally and the BJP.        
	In Bengal, the Left Front has come under severe attack from various forces. Nowhere in India has the Left developed so much as in Bengal and it has the strongest base in Bengal. So, it is necessary for the Left Front here to strengthen its unity, counter the attacks and fight back, Karat said while delivering the Promode Dasgupta Memorial Lecture organised by the CPM to mark the birth centenary of the late state secretary.        
	Also present were chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, CPM state secretary Biman Bose and a section of the state party leadership that feels that the headquarters blind anti-Congressism is the biggest factor that led to Opposition unity and successive Left debacles in Bengal.        
	If the Bengal leadership was nursing any faint hope of a rethink, Karat said: Given the current situation, the Left should also mobilise people against the UPAs neo-liberal policies like the hike in petro prices and rising food inflation.                                
	In his 45-minute lecture the CPM leader talked about the need to build a non-Congress, non-BJP united front, not merely for electoral gains but to put up a united struggle on pro-people issues. Only that can lead to the possibility of exploring a political alternative to the Congress and the BJP, he said.        
	However, in the same breath, the CPM general secretary said: But I am not saying that a third alternative is feasible now. Such non-feasibility was one of the reasons cited by the Bengal CPM leadership when Karat wanted to withdraw support to UPA I and ally with Mayavati.        
	Although Karat trained his guns on both the Congress and BJP, he sought to draw a difference between the two parties by saying that the former was secular and the latter a representative of communal forces.        
	 Both represent the bourgeoisie and landlords. But a difference has to be made between the Congress and BJP. The Congress is secular, though they have a record of vacillations. It is this understanding that made the Left parties support the UPA I government. Our stand was to have an independent role and to oppose anti-people policies of that government. But when they deviated from the economic and foreign policies, we decided to break away, he said.        
	If the Bengal leaders were seeking some solace in the distinction, a damper came in the form of a statement that referred to alienation of the peasantry from the Left and shortcomings and weaknesses.         
	There have been some electoral setbacks for the Left in Bengal. The peasantry has become alienated. Lenin had said that its not important that you make mistakes if you learn from them. In Bengal, the Left should identify the weaknesses and shortcomings and overcome them, Karat said.        
	The statement was a public echo of sentiments expressed at meetings by the CPM central leadership that felt that the failure of the state government in delivering development was a key factor in losing elections. Industries minister Nirupam Sen, considered close to Karat, had said yesterday development projects were not implemented properly in the state.        
	After asking the Left to identify the weaknesses and shortcomings, Karat put the ball squarely in the CPMs court. The CPM, being the largest contingent of the Left Front, will have a major responsibility in this regard, he said.        
	 Our Bengal party is not favouring the pursuit of a strong anti-Congress line as we want to weaken the partys links with Trinamul before next years Assembly polls. But our central party leadership doesnt feel so as is evident from Karats remarks, a CPM secretariat member said later.

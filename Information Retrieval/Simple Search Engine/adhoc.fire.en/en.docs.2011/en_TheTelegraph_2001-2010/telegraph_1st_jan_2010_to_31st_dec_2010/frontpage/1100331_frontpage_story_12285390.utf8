The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Foreign varsities? Not optimistic
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Foreign varsities? Not optimistic
          AMIT ROY                            Venkatraman Ramakrishnan                                  
	London, March 30: Allowing foreign universities to set up campuses in India probably does not do any harm but may not do too much good either, Nobel winner Venkatraman Ramakrishnan said in London as he left for India today to collect his Padma Vibhushan.         
	I am not that optimistic, he said.        
	At a meeting yesterday with Indian journalists, Ramakrishnan was asked about the possible benefits from the foreign university bill, due to be tabled in Parliament.        
	Ramakrishnan, 57, the Cambridge University professor who shared the 2009 Chemistry Nobel for his work on ribosomes, had to hire a white tie and tails for nearly 200 when he received his Nobel medallion in Stockholm in December.        
	Thats once in a lifetime, he laughed. I am not a great one for dressing up.        
	For tomorrows grand function at Rashtrapati Bhavan, I will probably wear a kurta.        
	His views on inviting foreign universities into India are equally simple  he does not like it.        
	Whenever these outstations, as I call them, have been established  for instance, in Southeast Asia or in the Middle East  they have not reproduced the culture of the original place, he explained.        
	When you go to Cambridge, you will be in a whole international group of people who all come to Cambridge; there is a history to the place, the faculty is of international calibre. You have to ask which professor from Cambridge is going to pick up from his lab or institution and then move to this outstation somewhere else.        
	He went on: You should know that universities like Cambridge have not opted to set up these campuses precisely for that reason. It is really the lesser-tier universities that are agreeing to set up in India and I suspect they are doing it for business reasons.        
	As for the kind of students the new campuses might attract, I suspect only the very rich people will end up going to these campuses. The one good thing that might happen is (that) because of competition, it might help raise salaries in Indian universities. Competition might (also) raise the standard of Indian universities.        
	Ramakrishnan said he was grateful and rather touched and honoured at being awarded Indias second-highest civilian honour because the reality is that I became a US citizen 25 or 30 years ago and lived outside India for the last almost 40 years.        
	Receiving the acclaim of Indians after he won the Nobel, Initially, I was completely amazed. Then I had a moment of panic. I was deluged by emails from complete strangers from India.        
	Somewhat apologetic, he confessed: Then, maybe I overreacted because I thought it was disrupting my work, and that caused some anger in India; people accused me of arrogance. I was a little worried when I went to India (in December) about what my reception would be but I found people were uniformly warm and affectionate.        
	Ultimately I realised what it is  that I was someone who had grown up in India, studied in India, got my first degree in India and then had gone on to do well. It gave people a sense of hope, maybe a sense of inspiration that they, too, could do something. It means that the early education (and) training I got was of a quality that allowed me to do well. They didnt hold me back or damage me in some way.        
	He acknowledged there were scientists of high calibre working in India: People like C.N.R. Rao. What India needs are more role models for how to do really first-rate, original, cutting-edge work.        
	He said: The reason why Indians do well when they go to Cambridge or Yale or Berkeley is that they see these role models. And they realise they are not magicians, but they have a way of looking at science and asking, What is the really most important question, how do I approach it, (what is) the next experiment I should do that will get me towards that?        
	Ramakrishnan added: Most scientists are content to just do the next experiment; they get new information, they publish it. But there arent enough role models who (say) I am not just going to do the next experiment. What is the thing I really want to know and then figure out how to do it?        
	Winning the Nobel has not changed his daily lifestyle. Yesterday, he could have come by chauffeur-driven limousine from Cambridge. Instead, dressed casually, tie-less and carrying a rucksack, Ramakrishnan came to London by train and walked several miles from Kings Cross station to his meeting with Indian journalists near Charing Cross station.

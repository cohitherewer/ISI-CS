          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Oct. 31: After arresting Maoist zonal commander Kundan Pahans girlfriend earlier this week, the police achieved another breakthrough when they nabbed a first year student of a Bundu college last evening who had also been working for Pahan.        
	Twenty-year-old Sushila Kumari, a first-year science student of Panch Pargana Kisan College in Bundu, was arrested on the basis of information provided by Pahans girlfriend Cecelia Guriya, who was arrested on October 26 with 30 rounds of ammunition and a letter from CPI (Maoist) politburo member Amitabh Bagchi.        
	Senior superintendent of police Praveen Kumar confirmed Kumaris arrest and said the girl had been deputed by Pahan to propagate the Maoist ideology among college students and to recruit them for the armed struggle against the government.         
	Sushila is a resident of Sindri under Arki police station area of Khunti, but was active in Bundu-Tamar area. She joined the Naxalites three years ago. She had worked with Cecelia, and doubled as a courier for the rebels, Kumar said.         
	While an FIR had been filed against the girl at Bundu police station, she had not been produced before the chief judicial magistrate till late this evening.         
	Sources said the girls father, Heeralal Munda, had been interrogated by the Bundu police to establish the extent of her links with the Maoists.         
	Those who knew Sushila at Bundu, described her as a popular and sincere student. Other students always turned to her for suggestion and advice from her before taking any decision, a local resident who did not wish to be identified said.         
	The same resident, however, admitted that Sushila had convinced more than 12 girls about the Maoist ideology by citing the failure of the government in ensuring justice for the tribals. Had she stayed for some more days at the college, she would have made a strong base of the outlawed outfit here, the resident said.         
	Meanwhile, an officer said the police are on the lookout for another Sushila, who happens to be a member of the armed squad of the Maoists.        
	 While this Sushila used her intellect to fight the government, the other Sushila uses arms and ammunition. We hope to arrest the second Sushila soon, the Bundu police officer said.

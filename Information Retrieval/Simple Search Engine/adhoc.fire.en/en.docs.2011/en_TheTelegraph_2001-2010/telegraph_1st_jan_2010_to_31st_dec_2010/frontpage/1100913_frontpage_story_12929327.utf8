	Ranchi, Sept. 12: A day after taking over the reigns of the state, chief minister Arjun Munda hotfooted to Nagpur with his deputies Sudesh Mahto of Ajsu and Hemant Soren of JMM to seek the blessings of BJP chief Nitin Gadkari and RSS boss Mohan Rao Bhagwat.         
	On the agenda were discussions on the crucial issue of cabinet expansion, which is likely to be held either on September 14 after Munda sails through the trust vote or on September 15.

	Apparently, both Gadkari and the RSS backed Munda to the hilt in his attempts to realign with the unpredictable JMM and form the government in the face of opposition from senior party leaders L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley.         
	Both Gadkari and Munda, however, denied there were differences within the BJP over government formation. There is no need to create confusion, Gadkari said.        
	Mahto, on his return from Nagpur, also insisted it was a courtesy call. Since the RSS headquarters was just five minutes away from Gadkaris residence, we also visited Bhagwat, he told The Telegraph.         
	Munda maintained that Gadkari had assured him full co-operation of the party in running the government. He accepted our invitation to visit Jharkhand, Munda said.         
	In Ranchi, meanwhile, coalition partners juggled with the challenges of picking up MLAs for the council of ministers. While it was understood that the JMM would get five berths including that of deputy chief minister, the dilemma facing the party was who the other four would be.        
	We are not in a position to accommodate either Teklal Mahto or Simon Marandi as both figure in a sting operation that showed them demanding money to vote in the last Rajya Sabha polls. The vigilance bureau had lodged FIRs against them on the Election Commissions directive. So, it will not be politically prudent to accommodate them in the ministry, said a JMM source.        
	The duo had raised the banner of revolt along with Champai Soren after Shibu Soren kept them out of his government. The JMM is likely to pick Champai, Mathura Prasad Mahto, Hemlal Murmu and Haji Hussain Ansari as its ministers.        
	Ajsu too was unwilling to reveal the number of cabinet berths it had bargained for. We will decide soon, was all Mahto was prepared to say.         
	While Ajsu wanted three berths including deputy chief minister, the BJP, keen to get four berths for itself including chief minister, was only willing to give the Ajsu two, leaving one for the JD(U).        
	The BJP is also facing a problem in picking the right mix. Munda needs to accommodate Raghubar Das, Baidyanath Ram, Arun Mandal and Neelkanth Singh Munda.

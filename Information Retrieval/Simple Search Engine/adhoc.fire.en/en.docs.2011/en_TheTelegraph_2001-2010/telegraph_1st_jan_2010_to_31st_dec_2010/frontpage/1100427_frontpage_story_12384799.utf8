  - Speaker rejects Paulus Surins resignation           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                     
	Ranchi, April 26: Shibu Soren today left for New Delhi and attended the Lok Sabha session, something he hasnt done ever since he was sworn in chief minister on December 30 last year, continuing to keep the state on tenterhooks on the choice of his seat for contesting Assembly elections.        
	A day after being at the centre of a high-voltage political drama when he asserted that he was in no mood to give up his chair in favour of his son, Soren reiterated: I will contest the election. But I am yet to decide the seat.        
	Earlier, Speaker C.P. Singh rejected the resignation letter of jailed JMM leader Paulus Surin after he was satisfied that the Torpa MLA was now not keen to give up his seat.         
	I have rejected Surins resignation after having got to know of the JMM MLAs decision to withdraw his resignation, he said, adding: Assembly procedures require the Speaker to be satisfied with the fact that the MLA hasnt submitted the resignation under any pressure.              
	At yesterdays JMM legislature party meeting, it was clear that the party leadership did not want him to quit. Soren, accompanied by son Hemant and ministers Hemlal Murmu and Haji Hussain Ansari even met the Speaker informally to inform him about their stand.        
	Soren, who is MP from Dumka, cannot skip the Lok Sabha session for more than 60 working days in a row. Under the Constitution (Article 101- 4), the House can declare a seat vacant if a member remains absent for 60 days without the Speakers permission.         
	According to the chief ministers office, in New Delhi Soren is scheduled to meet senior BJP leaders. He has been accompanied by agriculture minister Mathura Mahto and son Hemant Soren.         
	Soren will also go to Chennai for a health check up at Apollo Hospital.         
	Commenting on the speculation over the choice of his seat, JMM organisational secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said the mist will clear in the next couple of days after Soren returns from Delhi.

	Calcutta, Jan. 7: Prime minister Manmohan Singh today flew down to the city to see ailing CPM leader Jyoti Basu, whose condition continued to remain critical even as doctors said that artificial supply of oxygen to his lungs was partially reduced intermittently.        
	Today, there has been no significant improvement in his condition except that his ventilation has been reduced to partial support, a medical bulletin issued by AMRI Hospitals stated.         
	An attending doctor told The Telegraph that they could afford to reduce artificial supply of oxygen only because Basus lungs had shown some signs of improvement.         
	But it is difficult to say whether the improvement is permanent and thats why oxygen supply is reduced, explained the doctor, part of the eight-member medical board looking after Basus treatment since he was admitted at the Salt Lake hospital with pneumonia on January 1.         
	Basus blood pressure, which had dipped to alarmingly low levels yesterday, did fluctuate in the morning, but the doctors said it was partially stabilised with inotropic drugs (which stabilise blood pressure) in the afternoon.         
	The amount of inotropic drugs have been reduced as late in the evening his maximum BP was fluctuating between 140 and 120. These are all good but temporary signs. We have to wait for some time to see how he responds to the treatment, the doctor said.         
	Today, the medical board got assurance of all help from the Prime Minister, who went to the hospital after landing at the airport at 12.30pm.         
	During his 20-minute stay at the hospital, Singh spent few moments near bed No. 649 in the sixth-floor ICCU, where Basu is undergoing treatment since his condition deteriorated on January 2 and he was put on non-invasive respiratory support.         
	Singh, who was accompanied by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee from the airport and Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, then went to the eighth-floor VIP lounge for an update on the communist leaders condition and the future course of treatment.         
	CPM politburo members Brinda Karat, Biman Bose and Sitaram Yechury, former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, two doctors  cardiologist A.K. Maity and critical care expert Susruta Bandyopadhyay  Basus son Chandan and his aide Joykrishna Ghosh were present in the lounge during the 15-minute meeting.         
	We dont want to keep any stone unturned to revive Jyoti Basu, Yechury reportedly told the doctors in the presence of Singh, who appreciated the efforts of the medical board.         
	The Prime Minister also told the doctors that he could arrange any specialist from anywhere in India in case the medical board felt the need for further consultation, said Bose after Singh had left the hospital.         
	The medical board, however, decided after a meeting that it would not take any specialists help from outside right now.        
	Although four politburo members were present during the Prime Ministers visit to the hospital, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat reached the hospital around 30 minutes after Singhs convoy of 20 cars had left for the airport.         
	Mamata Banerjee was today busy with a railway foundation stone-laying event.        
	Doctors said the interim culture sensitivity report of the Lavage  collected through bronchoscopy yesterday  suggests the presence of bacteria called Gram negative bacilli. The final test will confirm if a sub-type of Gram negative bacilli, called acinetobacter, caused Basus lung infection.        
	It is a bacteria which causes pneumonia, typhoid, cholera and urinary tract infection, said one of the doctors treating him.         
	Two types of antibiotics, colistin and tigecycline, were being administered intravenously twice every day.         
	The antibiotics were started yesterday as we had assumed that this bacteria caused the lung infection. It will take another 24 hours to find out if these antibiotics are having the desired effect, the doctor said.        
	His age is the biggest concern. Things can again turn worse any moment.

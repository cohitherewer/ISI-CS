  - Motive behind attack on media was to hide camps           OUR BUREAU                    A CPM flag hoisted outside party leader Anuj Pandey rsquo;s house in Dharampur on   Friday after the ldquo;recapture rdquo; of the village from the Maoists.

	Calcutta, Sept. 5: The attack on seven journalists by CPM activists on Friday was not a mistake but a deliberate move to prevent them from reporting about camps at three villages where arms may have been stocked to counter Maoists, suggests information collected from intelligence officials.        
	Among the seven journalists who were attacked with iron rods and sticks was Pronab Mondal, The Telegraphs principal correspondent, and Amit Datta, the newspapers photographer. Mondals left forearm was fractured.        
	CPM leaders, who have admitted the attack was carried out by party activists, have been claiming so far that the assault occurred by mistake  a conclusion that springs holes in the face of the intelligence findings.        
	The assessment of a deliberate motive to prevent the journalists from discharging their professional duty tallies with Mondals account in which he said an attacker had shouted cut his hands so he cant write any more copies.                   
	The intelligence officials said that CPM workers, who had marched in triumph into Dharampur on Thursday, had entered Buripal, Pathri and Kalshibhanga villages between August 15 and August 25 and set up camps there when the Maoists withdrew from that belt following intense raids by the joint forces.        
	From our sources, we have learnt that the CPM activists have set up the camps to keep watch on primarily two villages  Rameswarpur and Lakshmanpur  about 9km away and where a big group of Maoist guerrillas are concentrated, an officer said.        
	According to information available with the intelligence branch, Maoist action squad leaders like Bikash, Rakesh and Badal, along with about 40 guerrillas, are hiding in the jungles adjacent to the two villages.         
	We have information that these guerrillas are armed with Insas and AK-47 rifles. Possibly, Kishan is also among them. So, we have reason to believe that the camps set up by the CPM are also stocked with arms. After speaking to local sources, we fear that CPM cadres may be preparing themselves for a big battle with the Maoists in this area, a police officer said.        
	So, the police officer explained, the CPM cadres would not want anyone to bring to light the existence of these camps.        
	A CPM member explained that after the joint forces killed Sidhu Soren, the secretary of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities and chief of the PCPAs armed wing, in July, the Maoists had retreated from the area and taken shelter in the jungles adjoining Rameswarpur and Lakshmanpur.        
	If we drive out the Maoists from the jungles surrounding Rameswarpur and Lakshmanpur, it will be a victory for us. Then, large areas of Lalgarh, Salboni and Kotowali will be free from Maoists. That is why we are setting up our camps in these areas, from where we can keep an eye on their movement, said a CPM leader in Salboni.        
	Other CPM sources said that the forests surrounding Rameswarpur and Lakshmanpur needed to be freed from Maoists for another reason.         
	Our supporters and workers who had fled their homes in the face of Maoist threats over a year ago are now gradually returning home. So, if the Maoists are not driven out from that area, there will be a danger of attacks on villagers who are returning home after a long time, the CPM leader said.

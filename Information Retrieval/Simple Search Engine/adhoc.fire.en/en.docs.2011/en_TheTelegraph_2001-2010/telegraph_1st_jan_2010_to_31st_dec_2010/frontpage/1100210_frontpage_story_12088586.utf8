  - Nobody is colluding with Maoists: Chidambaram          BARUN GHOSH                      Chidambaram and Bhattacharjee at the news conference after the meeting at Writers rsquo;. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                
	Calcutta, Feb. 9: When in Bengal, do as lawyers do, even if you happen to be the Union home minister.        
	P. Chidambaram was at his courtroom best today while fielding a question that has been playing on the mind of many in Bengal, including his next-seat occupant, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	Mr Chidambaram, West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who is sitting by your side, has been repeatedly accusing your cabinet colleague Ms Mamata Banerjee of colluding with Maoists. How do you react to this? The Telegraph asked the home minister during a media conference at the conclusion of a four-state meeting on the rebels.        
	Chidambaram could not but suppress a smile and then said: You can put that question to Mr Chief Minister and Ms Banerjee. As far as I am concerned, nobody is colluding with Maoists. Nobody can collude with Maoists. No political party in India that believes in parliamentary democracy can collude with them.         
	Chief minister Bhattacharjee cut a poker face and looked straight.        
	If that gave an Aha! moment to the Trinamul Congress, which did jump for joy later, a careful reading of the statement of the home minister, who is also a reputable lawyer, suggests he chose his words with extreme care.        
	There is a difference between saying nobody is colluding with Maoists and as far as I am concerned, nobody is colluding with Maoists. The preceding conditional sentence leaves Chidambaram on safe territory, making it clear the assertion is based on information available to him.        
	The next sentence also is a masterstroke of a response  the word can makes a world of difference. No political party in India that believes in parliamentary democracy can collude with them is not the same as no one is doing so.        
	No evidence exists of any collusion between Trinamul and the Maoists since the launch of a joint operation in Lalgarh  in recent months, the guerrillas have killed Mamatas supporters, too though nuanced differences are at play between the party and others on how to tackle the extremists and whether talks should be given primacy over a crackdown.        
	But Chidambarams fault-proof response underscored the tightrope the Centre is walking as it prepares for expanding an inter-state joint operation. Such operations covering Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa are expected soon.        
	When it was pointed out that the railway minister has said she is against the operation of the joint forces in West Midnapore, Chidambaram said: She told me that the operations we have been carrying out in West Midnapore are not yielding results. She has a point of view and I have taken note of that. We will try to make the operations as effective as possible.        
	Chidambaram hastened to add that Mamata had also told him that innocent people were being affected by the joint forces operation. She (Mamata) also told me that the operation is affecting innocent people there. We will ensure that this doesnt happen.        
	Mamata, who watched Chidambarams televised news conference sitting at her Kalighat home, did not publicly react to his statements. But Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said: Chidambaramji today gave a clean chit to Mamatadi in the presence of Buddhababu (Bhattacharjee). I would suggest that the chief minister send this message to his party bosses like Prakash Karat who are accusing Mamata of maintaining links with Maoists just to do politics.        
	CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim said: Chidambaram had just stuck to his jot dharma (ethics of alliance). If he had acknowledged Mamatas links with Maoists, it would be impossible for her to stay in the alliance.

          OUR BUREAU                            Singh and Karunanidhi	                                
	Nov. 12: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said it was for the Congress high command to take note of the offer of support made by AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa and added that the alliance with the DMK stood as of now.        
	This is a subject I am hearing for the first time. It is for the Congress high command to take note of it. I dont know what Dr Jayalalithaa has offered. We are in alliance with the DMK and that alliance stands as of now, Singh told reporters accompanying him on his return from Seoul where he attended the G20 Summit.        
	The Prime Ministers comments appeared to be far more guarded than other Congress leaders and ministers. They said in Delhi that the contents of the CAG report, which is said to have adverse remarks on telecom minister and DMK leader A. Raja, could not be treated as an indictment.        
	A veteran Congress leader said the party would stick to coalition dharma and let the DMK decide its future course on Raja. He added that allegations involving telecom deals could also be levelled against the NDA regime in 2000.        
	Asked what he was planning to do about Raja after the CAG report on 2G spectrum allocation, the Prime Minister said: Parliament is in session. It is not proper for me to comment on a subject which is also probably in the court.        
	DMK leader M. Karunanidhi today defended Raja and ruled out his resignation.

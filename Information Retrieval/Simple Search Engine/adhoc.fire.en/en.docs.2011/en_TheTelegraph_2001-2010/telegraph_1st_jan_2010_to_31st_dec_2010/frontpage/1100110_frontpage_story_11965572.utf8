          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.                      Shashi Tharoor                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 9: The Congress today expressed surprise at junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoors partial criticism of the contributions of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru to Indias foreign policy.        
	Tharoor said last evening that Indias foreign policy, drawing on Gandhis and Nehrus thoughts, had earned a reputation as a moralistic running commentary.        
	I am very surprised by Tharoors style. He is a member of the Congress and his responsibility is to carry forward the legacy of Pandit Nehru and not to be critical of it, Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said.        
	Tharoors remarks came at an event to honour Bhikhu Parekh, political theorist and Labour MP in Britains House of Lords. The event was organised by an association of Indian diplomats at Delhis Indian Council of World Affairs. Parekh, in his speech Indias place in the world, called Nehrus foreign policy a mistake.        
	Nehrus policies gave India an exaggerated sense of self-importance and moral self-righteousness. He even developed Indian foreign policy as though it was speaking for the whole of Asia, homogenising the entire continent and ignoring internal conflicts, the MP said.        
	Parekh added that Indira Gandhis foreign policy lacked strategic thinking. He said: Indiras policies had no real desire to play a global role and shape the world. Her interests were more regional.        
	Tharoor later said: I think his (is a) very clear summary for us of the way in which Indian foreign policy drew from our founding fathers sense of our civilisational heritage, the extraordinary contribution of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru to the articulation of that civilisational heritage, the manner in which that both enhanced Indias standing in the world and gave us the negative reputation for conducting foreign policy as a sort of moralistic running commentary on other peoples behaviour.        
	The Thiruvananthapuram MP said Parekh and he came from the same school of thought. That Lord Parekh and I have fought alike on issues of Indias identity and domestic arrangements as well. So we do, I am afraid, come from a similar outlook of the world.        
	Later, Tharoor posted this on Twitter: Attended gr8 lecture by Lord Bhikhu Parikh on Indias Place in the World at IndianCouncil of World Affairs. Lively discussion on principles. Parikh sparked debate abt whether Ind shld export its values. Were btr just setting an example: being who we are, letting world learn frm us.        
	Ahmed hinted that Tharoor should have been more deferential towards Nehrus foreign policy. The entire world appreciates it (Nehrus foreign policy). It was a new idea, he said.

	New Delhi, July 23: India and the US today differed sharply on American military aid to Pakistan with defence minister A.K. Antony telling the topmost US military commander, Admiral Mike Mullen, that its supplies were being misused.        
	But Admiral Mullen, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said after a 45-minute meeting with Antony: I dont believe that we have sold any weapons to Pakistan which greatly imbalance the relationship between the two countries.        
	The contradictory views on the issue of military aid to Pakistan did not cast a shadow on co-operation in counter-terrorism. The US ambassador to India, Timothy J. Roemer, and the Union home secretary, G.K. Pillai, today signed the Counter-Terrorism Co-operation Initiative.        
	The bonhomie in North Block, where the home ministry is headquartered, did not find an accurate reflection in the defence ministry across Rajpath in South Block.        
	Antony told Mullen that India was concerned that US military supplies to Pakistan were disproportionate to the threat from terrorism that Islamabad says it is facing. Indian defence sources allege that the military aid being extended by Washington liberally was being used by Islamabad to ramp up its conventional military strength vis--vis India.        
	US military supplies to Pakistan in 2010 are expected to be more than the $300 million that they have grossed annually. Among the supplies are F-16 Fighting Falcon combat aircraft. Most of the hardware that the US is supplying to Pakistan is classified but the list is known to include Harpoon missiles, heavy artillery guns and helicopter gunships.        
	Defence ministry sources said Antony had also asked Mullen if the US had instituted a monitoring mechanism to ensure that Pakistan was using the arms for the purpose that the US was supplying them  to take on terrorists on the Pakistan-Afghanistan frontier.        
	Antony is scheduled to visit the US in September for a second time since taking over the defence portfolio.        
	Mullen later said that US military aid has to be specifically used against the terrorist threat in their own (Pakistans) country as far as we know the defence systems that they (Pakistan) are getting, they are using against terrorists.        
	The admiral said the US was also concerned about Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), that India has alleged was behind terror attacks. I believe that the overall strategic approach of the ISI needs to fundamentally change. It is an extraordinarily difficult task. It is going to take some time, he said.        
	Mullen said that in his meetings in Delhi, he briefed senior Indian officials on Afghanistan.

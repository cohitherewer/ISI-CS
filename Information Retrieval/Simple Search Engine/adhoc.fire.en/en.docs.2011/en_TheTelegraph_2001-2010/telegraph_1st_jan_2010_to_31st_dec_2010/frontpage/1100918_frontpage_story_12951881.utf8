  - Olive Greens march back to retain army identity          SUJAN DUTTA                        Former army chief JJ Singh in fatigues				   Army Chief V.K. Singh Olive Greens                                      
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: General V.K. Singh has quietly changed Friday dressing norms at army headquarters.        
	Officers and soldiers who were required to don disruptive pattern fatigues  the uniform they go into action in  are now back to wearing the drab OGs  Olive Greens.        
	The order to wear battle fatigues was issued by General Joginder Jaswant Singh when he was the army chief (now he is the Arunachal governor) in 2005.         
	Tiger JJ ordered that the fatigues be worn to empathise with soldiers who are deployed in operational areas and in hardship postings. A third of the 1.2 million-strong Indian Army is always posted in field areas  for counter-insurgency in the Northeast and Kashmir and in border posts.        
	Friday dressing a term coined in the fashion world and meaning casual wear for the last working day of the week  came to have an entirely different connotation in the Indian Army. JJ led by example, diligently outfitting himself in crisp battle fatigues with his service revolver always loaded and holstered at the waist.         
	Every Friday for the last five years, the offices and roads around Sena Bhavan and the integrated headquarters of defence in South Block were awash with men wearing battle fatigues, in peak winter as in scorching summer.                    
	To visitors not used to the sight, the scene could well be daunting: why are so many men looking so battle-ready in the heart of a peaceful capital, many have wondered.        
	The navy also followed suit --- and even today naval officers and sailors wear the blue uniform that they are required to wear on decks instead of the whites that they are usually in when they are ashore. Air force personnel on duty (such as the Garud commandos) also often wear disruptive pattern fatigues but most stick to wearing the sky blue-dark blue combination. (Aviators wear the G-suit or jumpers if they are flying).        
	Unlike JJ, the barrel-chested Ranger, General V.K. Singh, has decided the culture of the army need not be showcased through its sartorial codes.        
	But there is a deeper reason for the change in the dress code that the army is unwilling to state officially in public. The army top brass --- the uniform regulations are decided by the Adjutant Generals branch --- is unhappy that central and state police organisations have made the Indian Armys battle fatigues commonplace.        
	In Jammu and Kashmir and Lalgarh in Bengal, for example, Central Reserve Police Force and state police personnel have been wearing the battle fatigues, complete with the symbol of the Indian Army --- the Ashoka emblem over a pair of crossed swords --- printed on them on duty.        
	Army headquarters have written to the defence minister and the defence ministry has in turn complained to the home ministry of this misuse of the army uniform. But central police organisations have argued that their personnel are also deployed in operational areas and need the camouflage disruptive pattern --- to blend with the countryside --- to work effectively.        
	The upshot is that in many regions, civilians are not able to distinguish between the army and the police. The army does not like being confused with the police. So, in Delhi, its back to Olive Greens on Fridays. The police cannot plagiarise or strip the army of that uniform, the top brass is convinced.

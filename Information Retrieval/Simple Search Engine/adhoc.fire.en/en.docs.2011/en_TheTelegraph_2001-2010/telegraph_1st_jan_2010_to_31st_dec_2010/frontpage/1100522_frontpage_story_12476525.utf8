The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | India tees missing in World Cup
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                India tees missing in World Cup
          G.C. SHEKHAR                                               
	Chennai, May 21: Almost out of the soccer World Cup even before the kickoff  T-shirts made in Tirupur, Indias hosiery hotspot.        
	A tax by South Africa, which is hosting the tournament next month, appears to have knocked out from the June carnival the most visible symbol of India, a country for which playing in the footballs greatest event remains a distant dream.         
	Lakhs of spectators at previous editions had worn the Tirupur-made World Cup tees as they cheered their favourite teams.        
	That seems unlikely this time. Exports of the garment for this years carnival have hit an all-time low, with the t-shirtmakers in this Tamil Nadu town wrong-footed by the levy.        
	We will be exporting only 20,000 such T-shirts to a buyer from South Africa. This is nothing compared with the one million we had supplied for the last World Cup, in Germany, rued D. Udhaya Shankar of Sree Santosh Garments.        
	The makers say that the levy, called entry tax, is so high that it increases the cost for South African buyers enormously.        
	The European Union charges only 10 per cent as entry tax, but South Africa imposes 27 per cent on T-shirts. This makes any large export order unviable as they (the buyers) are expected to pay the duty, said A. Sakthivel, the president of Tirupur Exporters Association (TEA).         
	Shankar, who claimed that his company had an excellent track record on quality and delivery schedules in the previous tournament, had expected a large order this year  before he ran into the tax spoiler.        
	After the good response that our T-shirts  with the official World Cup logo  received in the 2006 World Cup, our UK-based buyer, ASD Europe, placed an extra order for 1 million T-shirts for 2008. But when we started to explore the South African market ahead of this years World Cup, we were shocked to find such a high duty structure. They (the authorities) refused to relax it even for such a high-profile event, Shankar said.        
	Finally, one South African importer summoned the courage to play ball: he placed an order for 20,000 T-shirts with Shankars firm for $120,000 (Rs 55 lakh) and picked up the duty tab as well. But the deal pales before the two orders, of $4 million (Rs 18.4 crore) each, that Shankars company had won for the 2006 and 2008 tournaments.         
	The tax has meant there is no level playing field: this tournaments T-shirts, Shankar believes, will come from South African makers.        
	The soft and comfortable cotton T-shirts from Tirupur are in high demand overseas, with big names like Adidas, Nike and Gap among the buyers. For T-shirts and shorts made from synthetic yarn, the choice is China.         
	But in recent years, the orders have shrunk, partly because of the global slowdown. After touching a high of Rs 11,000 crore in 2006-07, knitwear exports from Tirupur declined to Rs 9,950 crore in 2007-08 and fell in 2008-09 to Rs 9,500 crore.         
	Th towns 668 exporters account for around 65 per cent of the countrys knitwear exports. Big international events like the World Cup or the Olympics not only boost our order book but also the visibility of our products. But this World Cup has proved a disappointment, said an office-bearer of the exporters association.

	Bhubaneswar, Jul 7 (PTI): Rail and road services were disrupted in some parts of Orissa as a two-day Bharat Bandh called by the Maoists in protest against the death of a top Naxal leader began today.   
	State-run bus service was suspended in Maoist-hit districts like Koraput, Malkangiri, Rayagada and Gajapati as precautionary measure-leaving passengers stranded at many places, police said. 	A passenger train and some goods trains were suspended in Sundargarh district, while private buses also stopped plying in some areas fearing Naxal attack. Vehicular movement in several rebel-infested regions remained restricted as the bandh evoked a mixed response in the state.   
	The bandh had little impact in urban areas though shops and business establishments remained closed in rural pockets of Malkangiri, Gajapati, Koraput, Rayagada, Keonjhar and Sundargarh, they said, adding the ultras blocked a road by felling trees in Kalimela area of Malkangiri district. 	No untoward incident has so far been reported from any part of the state where the situation remained peaceful, a senior police official said. 	Security was tightened and patrolling intensified in Maoist affected areas, while a strict vigil was maintained in areas bordering Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.   
	Special arrangements were made to ensure safety of train passengers and railway property as they have become a soft target of the ultras, the sources said.

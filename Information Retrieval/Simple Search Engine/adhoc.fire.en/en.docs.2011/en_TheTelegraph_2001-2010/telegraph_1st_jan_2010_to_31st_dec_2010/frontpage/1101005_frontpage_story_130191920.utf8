	Hyderabad, Oct 5 (PTI): The Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) today proposed that Mohammad Hashim Ansari, one of the main litigants in the Ayodhya title suit case, be given an honour like Padma Vibhushan for initiating efforts to resolve the vexed issue through an out-of-court settlement.
    "The spontaneous gesture and continuing efforts of Janaab Mohammad Hashim Ansari deserve prompt recognition," APCC General Secretary R Ananda Bhaskar said in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
    "Hence, I, on behalf of humble thinking class of my generation and younger generations, earnestly propose and request your esteemed authority to consider the name of Mohammad Hashim Ansari for the Gandhi Peace Prize, Padma Vibhushan and also to recommend his name for international peace and harmony awards such as Raman Magsaysay and Nobel peace prize," he said in the letter.

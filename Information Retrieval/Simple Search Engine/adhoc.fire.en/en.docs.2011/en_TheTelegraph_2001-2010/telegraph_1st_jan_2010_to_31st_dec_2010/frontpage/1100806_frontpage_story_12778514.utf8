  - Outfit criticised for Manipur blockade          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: The government and the Opposition parties today criticised the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) for provoking an economic blockade once again on the national highway to Manipur.         
	The issue was discussed in the Rajya Sabha today during zero hour.         
	NSCN (I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah has provoked the economic blockade by the United Naga Council, a home ministry source said.         
	The Naga organisations, spearheaded by the UNC, are demanding dissolution of the six autonomous district councils, elections to which were held in the five hill districts recently. They also want the government to withdraw Section 144 CrPC, IRB personnel and police commandos from the Naga areas.         
	Almost the entire Opposition, including the Left parties and the BJP, today stood by Manipur.         
	On the one hand, Government of India is holding talks with NSCN; on the other, certain overground front organisations of the same group are using coercion to get their point of view across, CPM MP Brinda Karat said during the special mention.         
	There are no oxygen cylinders in hospitals in Manipur. The going tax imposed by the UNC is Rs 30,000 for a truck of medical supplies and Rs 11,000 for a truck of cement, she said.         
	Karat demanded that Chidambaram, who was being soft on the issue, should ensure that supplies are immediately restored to Manipur.         
	People in Manipur are paying prices 10 times higher than that of Delhi, said Karat.         
	An earlier blockade continued for over two months as Naga NGOs demanded that Muivah be allowed to visit his native village of Somdal in Manipur.         
	The Manipur government, on the other hand, has come out with more than a hundred cases filed against Muivah to argue that the rebel leader can be arrested.         
	Considering that peace talks are in progress with Muivah  he met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Chidambaram and held parleys only a week ago  the Centre has appeared a little circumspect in cracking down hard on him.         
	I do believe that the hill people of Manipur have some very genuine concerns which have to be properly addressed and a political resolution has to be found. (But) Sir, what is this? asked Karat, addressing Rajya Sabha chairman Hamid Ansari.         
	The Left leader said the problems of the hill people should be resolved within a united Manipur clearly indicating there was no political consensus on Muivahs demand for an integrated Naga homeland.         
	A source said 470 trucks laden with supplies were travelling through National Highway 53 that reaches Manipur via Assam.

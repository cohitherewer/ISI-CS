	Lucknow, Sept. 19: Mohammad Hashim Ansari, 90, the oldest living petitioner in the Ayodhya title suit, says he prays every day for peace in the temple town as well as for truth and justice for the Babri Masjid.         
	I want to know the truth behind the dispute before I die, says the farmer and small-time businessman, who was in Lucknow recently for the hearing of the case.         
	Kissa sirf kanuni hota to itni lambi larai nahi larni hoti, siyasat harkat ne hamara dukh badhaya hai (Had it been just a legal dispute, it would not have been such a long battle. Politics has increased our pain), adds Hashim, the face of the ordinary Muslim in the 60-year battle for land in Ayodhya.         
	Peace is of utmost importance in a city where 270 houses belonging to Muslims were burnt in the wake of the Babri demolition in December 1992, he says.         
	I have been continuing the legal battle because this is a commitment to Allah as a Muslim. But peace has been my concern as well, he says.         
	No place in the world is as peaceful as Ayodhya. Ask the Muslim flower farmers who supply flowers for the temples. They were never seized by fear. We never suffered except during the clashes in 1992.         
	Hashim had filed a petition in a local court in 1949 asking for protection of the land of the Babri Masjid from encroachers who had installed Hindu idols in a corner of the mosque premises. The idols were placed inside the mosque on the night of December 22-23, 1949.         
	The then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, asked the Faizabad district magistrate to remove the idols. But district magistrate K.K. Nayar, who later became an MP of the Jan Sangh, the predecessor of the BJP, failed to act.         
	Looking back, his face cringing, Hashim says the politics began then. The Sunni Central Wakf Board, the main petitioner for the Babri Masjid now, joined the case later.                           
	I remember I was part of the crowd in the monsoon of 1949 when the last prayer in the mosque had taken place under the leadership of Maulana Abdul Gaffar. That landscape has receded far back into oblivion now, he says.         
	Prayers stopped after that because of tension. Residing at Panjitola on Sampark Marg, less than a km away from where the mosque lies in ruins now, Hashim is a devout Muslim revered by his community for his fight for justice. Even Hindu litigants admire his patience and tenacity, visiting the court and interacting with lawyers year after year.         
	Hashim, who studied up to high school and lives with his two sons who run a small car rental business that he started, says he does not think reconciliation is possible now. It has become far too complicated and politicised. I believe community leaders both among Muslims and Hindus betrayed the cause and used the issue for political gain, he says.         
	Hashim complains that the call for an amicable settlement, made by Muslims in the eighties, fell on deaf ears at a time when it could have paved the way for a solution.         
	There have been times when we thought the issue would be solved. For example, in 1986, there was a proposal to build a Ram temple at the outer boundary of the mosque. There was a broad consensus on this but then VHP claimed that Ramjanmabhoomi was right at the centre of the main dome of the mosque, he says. Now it is impossible to recreate that atmosphere of goodwill.        
	Once the mosque was pulled down, the complexion of the contest changed and the focus of the dispute became the 60x40 sq ft where the mosque stood.         
	The 90-year-old says no one wants to win a battle for justice to lose a war on peace. We want both.         
	The Ayodhya administration today sent notices to 200 VHP and Muslim leaders, restricting their movement and asking them to refrain from making provocative statements.

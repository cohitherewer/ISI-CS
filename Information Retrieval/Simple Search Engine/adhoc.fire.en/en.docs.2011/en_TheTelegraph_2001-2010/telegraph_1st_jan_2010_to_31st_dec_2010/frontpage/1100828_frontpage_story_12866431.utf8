	Lodhashuli (W. Midnapore), Aug. 27: The joint forces today shot dead a prime accused in the Jnaneswari Express sabotage, Umakanta Mahato, achieving their third big success against the rebels since a strategy shift towards night operations two months ago.        
	The police and local villagers provided different versions of how Umakanta, 35, may have been killed around 4am on the edge of the Nadda forests near Lodhashuli, 160km from Calcutta.        
	Officers claimed he was shot in the forest, about 20km from Jhargram town, after a two-hour gunfight with guerrillas during which the forces fired around 150 bullets. But residents of Chhoto Parulia, 500 metres from the forest, said they only heard 10 to 12 gunshots in rapid succession.        
	It was around 4am. Ten or 12 shots were fired within a few seconds, said Saraswati Mahato. Then the firing stopped and within minutes, we saw police vehicles head towards the forest.        
	There were two bullet wounds on Mahatos shoulder and back. Nearby, on a dirt track leading out of the forest, lay a red motorcycle that once belonged to a gram panchayat chief whom the Maoists had killed two months ago.        
	Umakanta, member of one of the village squads the Maoists had trained in the past two years, may have been fleeing the forest on the motorbike when the police got him, the villagers and the slain rebels wife Sabita said.        
	The police said they had been tipped off yesterday afternoon that Umakanta was about to enter the forest. Around midnight they had confirmation that he had done so. The CRPFs elite Cobra unit and police approached the forest late at night, said Jhargram superintendent of police Praveen Tripathi.        
	The force split, one group guarding the dirt track leading to the forest from NH6 and the other making a detour through two villages to reach the point where the track leaves the forest at the opposite end. We took position at both ends of the road, an officer said.        
	Tripathi claimed the Maoists began firing as the forces closed in. After about two hours of battle, the advancing forces spotted Umakantas body in a clearing. The others had fled. A revolver lay beside the body, he said.        
	An officer said Umakanta and his gang had kidnapped three CPM supporters around 7.30pm yesterday from nearby Chakua village, held a kangaroo court and shot them dead. The bodies of Gopal Mantri, 49, his son Rajib, 24, and cousin Tapan, 42, were found on a road this morning.        
	At Umakantas home in Bakshole, 7km from where he was killed, wife Sabita alleged he was shot from behind. Ive heard he was fleeing on his motorbike and the police chased him and shot him, she said.        
	He came home around 4pm yesterday to meet our four children and stayed for 10 minutes. He used to come every eight to 10 days. He was taking part in an anti-pollution movement in the area, protesting against the sponge-iron factories.        
	The police said Umakanta led a Maoist frontal organisation, Paribesh Dushan Mancha. He had been arrested in June 2009 for blocking roads but got bail six months later and turned a fugitive.        
	The police linked him to the train tragedy after intercepting his phone conversations with Bapi Mahato, another prime accused who is in custody. The CBI had announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for information about Umakanta.        
	Earlier, night swoops by the forces had allowed them to take out eight guerrillas on June 16 and top Peoples Committee leader Sidhu Soren on July 26, both operations taking place near Lalgarh.

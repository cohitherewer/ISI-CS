The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pressure on Google deals
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Pressure on Google deals

	Beijing, March 24 (AP): China issued a blistering public attack against Google today and appeared to quietly begin getting businesses to abandon the US Internet giant after it moved its controversial Chinese search engine offshore.        
	The critical remarks in a high-profile Communist Party newspaper coupled with souring business deals underscored Beijings determination to settle scores with Google Inc. after a public two-month dispute over stringent Chinese censorship policies.         
	By challenging the often tetchy government, Google appears to have violated an unspoken rule of doing business in China, especially in the Internet industry whose control Beijing sees as crucial to maintaining its authoritarian rule.        
	Everybody in the Internet space operates under the good graces of the government, and if the governments not happy with your partner, you probably are going to have to change, said T.R. Harrington, founder and CEO of Shanghai-based Darwin Marketing, which specialises in advertising for Chinas search engine market.        
	Theres no upside in China, theres only downside.        
	Signs quickly appeared that some ties forged over Googles nearly four years operating in China were unraveling. Tianya.cn, a popular portal with 32 million registered users, said it was taking full control over social networking and question-and-answer services operated jointly with Google.        
	A company spokesman declined to say if the government exerted pressure but said in a statement that the takeover was being done to guarantee each product, normal business and good operations.        
	 Deals with Chinas top two mobile companies were also in doubt. In Hong Kong, executives with China Unicom Ltd., the listed unit of one of Chinas biggest mobile phone companies, hinted that it would shelve plans to offer two mobile phones running Googles Android programme.

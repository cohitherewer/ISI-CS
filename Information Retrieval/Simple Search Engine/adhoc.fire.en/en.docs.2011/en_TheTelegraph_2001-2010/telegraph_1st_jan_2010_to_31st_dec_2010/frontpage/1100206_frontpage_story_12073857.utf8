The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamata lines up 9 hospitals
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mamata lines up 9 hospitals
  - Bengal gains most under central plan        OUR BUREAU                                              
	Feb. 5: Mamata Banerjee continued to shower railway bounty on Bengal with her ministry today providing land for nine super-speciality hospitals, the highest for any state.        
	She signed an agreement with the health ministry headed by Ghulam Nabi Azad, under which the railways will provide plots of land along its 63,000km-long network to set up diagnostic centres and hospitals.        
	When intentions are clear, the government can deliver fast, Mamata said, delivering a boost to her do-gooder-for-Bengal image ahead of the Assembly polls a year away.        
	These facilities should be set up as early as possible, she added.        
	Health ministry sources said nine (see chart) of the proposed 20-acre sites for super-speciality hospitals will be located in Bengal. Maharashtra  a much larger state than Bengal  is second on the pecking order with five.        
	Although, by involving the health ministry, Mamata has elevated the project to more than a mere announcement to please her constituency, its not clear yet who will fund the super-speciality hospitals which could cost several hundred crores.        
	For example, the mere upgrading of Calcutta Medical College to a super-speciality hospital (named thus as they offer services in areas such as cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, neurosurgery and paediatric cardiology) is costing Rs 150 crore.        
	Dinesh Trivedi of the Trinamul Congress, who is the junior health minister, said: Essentially we are looking at public-private partnership models. However, wherever the state government wants to take part, they will be welcome.        
	Whether private investors will at all be interested in such ventures, particularly high-cost super-speciality hospitals in the districts, is a big question.         
	A working group will be formed shortly to work on project cost and funding.         
	Before the super-speciality hospitals, 361 diagnostic centres and 88 mid-level hospitals  around 10 of them in Bengal  will be built, close to railway stations.        
	It is unlikely that the super-speciality hospitals will get off the ground before the Assembly elections but the announcement of the intention itself will be hailed by Trinamul as a gift to Bengal where government-dispensed healthcare is in dismal shape.        
	Mamata gifted several new trains to Bengal in her last budget and announced new lines. She also went on a naming spree for Metro stations.        
	But the one promise of a super-speciality hospital she had made as coal minister in the Vajpayee government in 2004 remains unfulfilled.

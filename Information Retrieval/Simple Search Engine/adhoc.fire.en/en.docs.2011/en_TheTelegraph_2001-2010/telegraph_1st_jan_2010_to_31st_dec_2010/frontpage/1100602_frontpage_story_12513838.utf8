The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Zuma saves day: fourth lady to be first here
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Zuma saves day: fourth lady to be first here
  - South African President to bring only one wife for state visit to India          ARCHIS MOHAN                                    
	New Delhi, June 1: Thank you, Mr President, two wives would have been one two many  and three just three much.        
	Jacob Zuma, South Africas famously polygamous head of state, has solved a problem for South Blocks protocol-conscious babus. He will be bringing with him only one of his three wives for his state visit to India that starts tomorrow.        
	Just as well. Recent reports in the South African media suggest that two of Zumas younger wives are extremely jealous of each other and compete for the limelight during official events.        
	However, dilemma over First Ladies is nothing new for foreign ministry mandarins, who didnt know what to do when French President Nicolas Sarkozy was invited to be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade in 2008.         
	The R-Day chief guest and spouse share the dais with the Indian President and his/her spouse, but Sarkozy and Carla Bruni werent married yet. As harried officials tried to come up with an acceptable seating arrangement, Sarkozy chose to respect his hosts sensibilities. He came alone.        
	Now Zuma, too, has spared the babus the blushes. His fourth wife, Nompumelelo Ntuli, 35, better known as MaNtuli and reportedly pregnant with his 21st child, will be his First Lady during his India visit, his first to Asia since taking over as President in May 2009.        
	Its unlikely, though, that India will play midwife  MaNtulis pregnancy has been confirmed only recently.        
	Zuma, who has no designated First Lady, has married five times. The last time was in January when the 67-year-old tied the knot with Thobeka Madiba, 38.         
	His second wife  now the home minister in his cabinet  divorced him, while his third wife committed suicide.                                 
	His first wife, Sizakele Khumalo, whom he met in 1959 and married in 1973 and is said to be his favourite, remains out of media gaze. It is either MaNtuli or Madiba who have accompanied the South African leader on state visits abroad.        
	Zuma and MaNtuli, in Nice for the Africa-France summit, will land in Mumbai and stay in the Taj Mahal hotel as a mark of solidarity with the victims of the 26/11 attack.         
	While it is unlikely that his polygamous status will create much of a fuss in India, Zumas first state visit abroad to the UK this March as South Africas President was eventful.        
	Upset with his host countrys obsession with his polygamy, Zuma  who was accompanied by Madiba  had accused the British of being old-fashioned imperialists, hours before he was officially greeted by the Queen. He described himself as a freedom fighter being attacked by colonial bigots.         
	When the British came to our country, they said everything we did was barbaric, wrong and inferior. I dont know why they continue to think their culture is more superior than others. I have not looked down upon any culture and no one has been given the authority to judge others. The British have done that before, as they colonised us, and they continue to do this. It is an unfortunate thing, he had said.         
	While Zuma defends his polygamy as part of Zulu tradition, it has been a burden on the states exchequer. Reports in the South African media say the government expenditure on the First Lady  ladies in Zumas case  has doubled since he became President last year.        
	His predecessor Thabo Mbeki had only one wife.         
	Zuma, who recently accepted the existence of a love child with the daughter of an old friend, had also faced allegations of raping an HIV victim but was cleared of the charge later.         
	His views on HIV prevention, which were aired in court, had shocked AIDS activists. Zuma said he had a shower after sex to prevent HIV transmission and believed that a healthy man was unlikely to catch the disease.

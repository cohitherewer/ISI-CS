The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Shashi row buried after clarification 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Shashi row buried after clarification 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Tharoor: Indignant                                   
	New Delhi, Jan. 10: The Congress today decided to bury the row over Shashi Tharoors alleged comments on Jawaharlal Nehrus foreign policy after the minister gave a lesson in journalism to the media that he said had quoted him out of context.        
	There is nothing left in the issue now. It is clear that he was misquoted. We have nothing more to add to it, party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said today.        
	On Saturday, Ahmed had said: I am very surprised by Tharoors style. He is a member of the Congress and his responsibility is to carry forward the legacy of Pandit Nehru and not to be critical of it.        
	An angry Tharoor today called a media conference over the remarks attributed to him at a seminar in the Indian Council for World Affairs where he was the chairman. Tharoor said his summary of British Labour MP Bhikhu Parekhs speech was misreported as his own remarks.        
	The ministers outburst today followed not only comments attributed to him in the seminar but also attempts to stoke controversy over his tweets on visa regulation. Politicians in his party have been touchy about the outspoken minister and former UN diplomat who they say is yet to adjust to the Congress culture.        
	In a statement, the minister said that in concluding the seminar and speaking about Parekhs lecture he had observed: That Indian foreign policy drew from our sense of civilisation, and the extraordinary contribution by Mahatma Gandhi and Nehrujis articulation of our civilisational heritage, both enhanced Indias standing in the world but also earned us the negative reputation of running a moralistic commentary on world affairs  that has come through very clearly in your (Parekhs) speech.        
	It was not his observation that Nehru and Gandhi had shaped a foreign policy that had earned India the negative reputation of running a moralistic commentary on world affairs but Parekhs, Tharoor said.        
	To journalists this morning, Tharoor said that he had very gently and politely disagreed with Parekh. He did not reply to questions whether the Prime Minister had spoken to him.        
	Yes, I have spoken to a number of people who are disturbed about this type of press reporting. There are some press reports that are less tendentious. But as far as I am concerned, this is my view of the matter and I have shared this view with those I have spoken to, Tharoor said.         
	Asked what his senior, S.M. Krishna, had told him on visa rules, Tharoor said: I know what the minister told me and do not go by news reports of what he was supposed to have told me.        
	Tharoor was indignant when asked if he was embarrassing the Congress. I am not going to take this nonsense any more, he shot back.        
	Asked if he wanted his partys spokespersons to check with him before speaking on his remarks, he said: I think you should ask the Congress spokespersons whether they should have verified before commenting.

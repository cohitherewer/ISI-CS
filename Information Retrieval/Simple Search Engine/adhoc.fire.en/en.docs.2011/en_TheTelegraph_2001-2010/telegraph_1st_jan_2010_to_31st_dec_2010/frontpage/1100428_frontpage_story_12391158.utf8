	New Delhi, April 28: JantaKhoj InfoServices Pvt. Ltd. today launched Indias first and largest people search portal JantaKhoj.com. The interactive and user friendly website, powered by a vast database covering more than three hundred million Indians, will provide online and offline services to both individuals and businesses in India in the field of people search and background verifications.              
	The beta version of the website which goes online today will provide contact details, relatives and neighbours listings, and will also facilitate informed decision making for its consumers by offering comprehensive background checks.              
	Mr. Tarun Bangari, Founder amp; CEO, JantaKhoj says, we have a vision to democratize the background verification process and bring it within easy reach of every individual and to promote greater transparency in society by enabling deeper insights into the background of various individuals.              
	The sheer size of Indian population combined with the difficulty in accessing and searching the public records for reference and background information, means that a big opportunity exists in the sphere of people search and background verification checks says Mr. Ajit Gupta, the serial entrepreneur from Silicon Valley, Founder amp; Chairman. JantaKhoj aims to be a pioneer in this industry and has set up the technology platform which will scale in future to include other public and web-based sources including social media.              
	The premium services for individual customers cover background verification of matrimonial candidates, domestic help, drivers and tenants. The services allow the customer to select different applicable checks (address, criminal, education, work experience, driving license, reference) as required. JantaKhoj also offers employee background verification services to businesses. These too can be customized based on the requirements of a company. The firm has AAyuja, Aryaka, ByteRidge, EduMetry, Evolv, InvestmentYogi and PocketMoneyJobs as some of its business customers.

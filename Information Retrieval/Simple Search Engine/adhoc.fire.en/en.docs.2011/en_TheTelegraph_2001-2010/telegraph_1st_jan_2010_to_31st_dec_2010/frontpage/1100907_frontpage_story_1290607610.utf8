          OUR BUREAU                            The broken glass walls of the Arsalan. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Kolkata, Sep 7: The 24hour long industrial strike is not wholly peaceful, as activists tried forcefully shutting down many shops and eateries in many places.  
	 ldquo;Arsalan rdquo; a popular restaurant in Kolkata rsquo;s Free School Street, faced one such wrath from a group of activists who hurled stones and broke the glass wall covering the sales corner of the eatery. The incident did not bring in any serious injuries to anyone.   
	 On the other end police sources said in Chengail rsquo;s Ladlow Jute Mill few workers who were supporting the industrial strike clashed with colleagues who reported for duty today. The scuffle took place at the gate of the jute mill, which was later resolved by police. The workers, who reported for duty, alleged that workers supporting the industrial strike hurled bombs to scare them and prevent them from joining duty.

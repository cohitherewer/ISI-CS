  - Guwahati boy a hit on TV reality show          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Calcutta/Guwahati, Aug. 7: Kya baat, kya baat, kya baat! Saturday was a night when the entire TV-watching populace of India saluted 10-year-old Jeetumoni Kalita of Assam for winning Zee TVs dance reality show Dance India Dance Li Masters, handing him the coveted KB3 Trophy.         
	When Mithun Chakraborty, who has popularised the kya baat salute on the show, handed him the trophy, Jeetumonis eyes lit up but as it seemed too heavy for the slip of a boy, it was his trainer Dharmesh who quickly gave him a hand. Jeetu owes this success to two factors. First, his dedication and second, his humility. He is the only boy who used to touch the feet of even the spot boys before a performance, Dharmesh said.        
	The star-studded finale took place at Chhatrapati Shivaji Stadium, Pune, in the presence of actors Anil and Sonam Kapoor. Also present in the front row was Jeetumonis father Bharat Kalita, who works for the CISF, flaunting a gamosa. Flanking him were Jeetus mother Sabirani, sister Seema, cousin Diganta Saikia as also brother Manas, who has taught him the break dance that was his passport to the show and has been keeping him company during the four months of stay in Mumbai.        
	When we went to Calcutta for the auditions, the queue was so long that we thought wed never reach the end. Even when we cleared the zonal round and reached Mumbai, we had taken only three sets of clothes as we did not hope for a long stay. This is an unbelievable moment. Thank you, Assam, he told The Telegraph from Pune.        
	Debojit Saha, the first from the Northeast to win a TV reality show, was delighted as The Telegraph broke the news to him. Its great...simply great, was his first reaction to the success of young Jeetumoni. Debojit had won the Zee TV music reality show SaReGaMaPa in 2005.         
	Speaking over phone from Calcutta, Debojit revealed that Jeetumoni had, in fact, performed alongside him at a bihu function in 2008. He was part of a troupe which had performed with me and the crowd simply loved him. However, I did not know at that time. When I saw him on TV, only then I realised that this youngster is a real talent.        
	He will be a role model for the Northeasts youngsters, Debojit said, adding that he had even voted for him through SMS.                     
	Asha Baruah, a teacher at Maligaon Railway Higher Secondary School (where the boy studies in Class VI) said: I am elated...I was just watching the show and praying... He always has been a very obedient student who has done very well in annual school competitions... But we never thought he would go and win the heart of India. I am proud to have such a student.         
	AASU adviser Samujjal Bhattacharjee said: He is the pride of the Northeast. We will do whatever is necessary to see Jeetumoni through as a student. We will finance his studies if required.        
	Santanu Sarkar, advocate of Gauhati High Court who took pains to promote Jeetumoni said, I helped him because I saw the talent. I had to help him because I could not let such talent go waste...         
	Bani Das, director of popular Assamese films such as Maharathi and Mon said: I would feel proud to make him a part of my films. But here is a boy who will be a success in the national arena.         
	Manas Hazarika, award winning music director from Assam said, Its a great feelinghe will bring much more he is a role modelwill inspire many more.

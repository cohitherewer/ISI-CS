                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Alis wait ends at Prateeksha
                                Ali with Amitabh Bachchan at Prateeksha on Tuesday                             
	Ali Hussain Khan has nothing more to ask from life. The 11-year-old Calcutta kid with progeria on Tuesday met Auro, his reel-life likeness in Paa. An ecstatic Ali recounts how he met Amitabh Bachchan at his Juhu home               
	I flew to Mumbai on Tuesday with my parents and uncle Pradip Churiwal (the chairman and CEO of Macneill Engineering Ltd, where Alis father is a caretaker). I was so excited I had hardly slept the night before.         
	Our appointment was at noon at Mr Bachchans office in Bandra. We reached at 11.55am and waited in the reception. But after 15 minutes, someone told us that Mr Bachchan wouldnt be able to make it to the office as some people were demonstrating outside the premises against his imminent visit to Colombo. My heart sank.         
	But the messenger wasnt finished. He will meet you at his home, Prateeksha, he said. My spirits soared.         
	We arrived at the bungalow in Juhu at 12.25pm. I couldnt believe that I was actually inside Amitabh Bachchans home! It is a huge bungalow, three-storeys high. We were taken to the reception, where the walls were decorated with photographs of Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan.         
	After 10 to 15 minutes, Amitabh Bachchan walked in, wearing a white kurta and pyjama. I gazed at him in awe  how tall he is! He shook my hand. I barely reached up to his waist. On an impulse I embraced him and he hugged me back.         
	He gave me sweets and soft drink and made me sit beside him. Kyun tum mujhse milna chahte ho (Why do you want to meet me)? he asked. I told him that ever since I had watched him in Paa, I wanted to meet him. I also told him about my brother Ekramul, who had wanted to meet him too, but he passed away.         
	He asked me what I did and what I liked.         
	When I told him about my passion for photography he asked me to take his picture. I was thrilled beyond words. I also recorded a video on my cellphone and he bent down to see what I had shot.         
	Kabhi bhi koi kaam ho toh mujhe batana. Maje se raho (If ever theres something you need, tell me. Stay happy), he said before we parted. My dream has come true.                     AS TOLD TO SANJAY MANDAL

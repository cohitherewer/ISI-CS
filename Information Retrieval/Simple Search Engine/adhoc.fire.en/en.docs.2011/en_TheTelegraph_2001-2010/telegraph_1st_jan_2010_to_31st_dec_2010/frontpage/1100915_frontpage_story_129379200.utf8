	Muzaffarnagar, Sept 15 (PTI): Swollen river Yamuna has washed away boundary pillars demarcating districts of Uttar Pradesh from Harayana, officials said here.
    The boundary pillars and fix points in eleven districts of the two states have been washed away with the river Yamuna flowing above danger mark, they said.
    The farmers of the eleven districts, which includes Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Baghpat, Gotembudhnagar, Bullandshahar and Aligarh of Uttar Pradesh have already been engaged in clashes over the boundary line agreed upon in 1974.
    Several boundary pillars covering an area of 300 kms in various villages of Muzaffarnagar district alone have been washed away, they added.

	New Delhi, Sep 23 (PTI): The Allahabad High Court verdict on the Ayodhya title suit will not be delivered tomorrow with the Supreme Court deferring it by a week in a sudden turn of events today deciding to hear the plea for postponement next Tuesday.
    After sharp differences over the issue of entertaining the petition challenging the HC order refusing to postpone the judgement, a Bench comprising Justices R V Raveendran and H L Gokhale stayed for a week the verdict due to have been pronounced tomorrow by the High Court's Lucknow Bench.
    Following the court's tradition in case of differences, the Bench decided to issue notices to all the contesting parties and sought their response to the plea by retired bureaucrat Ramesh Chand Tripathi.
    Tripathi's petition pleaded for exploring the possibility of an out-of-court settlement on the 60-year-old Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit dispute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamata skips land bill meet
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mamata skips land bill meet
  - Minister keen on full   cabinet discussion        OUR BUREAU                      Mamata Banerjee                                      
	Oct. 25: Mamata Banerjee today skipped a meeting with Pranab Mukherjee that was meant to sort out differences over two land bills, leaving the Centre pressed for time as it scrambles to honour a promise to Rahul Gandhi to table them in the upcoming winter session.        
	Some Trinamul Congress sources claimed no official intimation had been received about the meeting but a rural development ministry official said: The finance minister had personally invited her to the talks.        
	Mamatas aides in Calcutta suggested the railway minister would not discuss the subject at any level other than a full cabinet meeting.        
	They said Mamata was studying a draft of suggested changes to one of the bills that she had asked party MP and lawyer Kalyan Banerjee to prepare for her. She will take her own time over this, an aide said.        
	The twin bills on land acquisition and land-losers rehabilitation were introduced in the Lok Sabha in February last year but have been hanging fire since Mamata forced the government to withdraw them.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, having assured Rahul two months ago about early tabling of the bills, had tasked Mukherjee with bringing Mamata around. Today, the finance minister, Mamata and rural development minister C.P. Joshi were to discuss the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, which is the one Mamata opposes.        
	The bill says that if 70 per cent of landowners in an area agree to sell to a private entrepreneur, the government can acquire the balance 30 per cent at the same price and pass it on to the industrialist or miner.        
	Mamata is opposed to any state role in land acquisition for private industry, but government sources are hoping she would agree to a compromise where the 70 per cent limit is raised. The Trinamul chief also wants a clause that will force industrial buyers to return the acquired land if it is not used within five years.        
	Trinamul ministers say that with the Bengal polls scheduled next year and the land agitations in Singur and Nandigram still live issues, it is difficult for the party to accept the bill in its current form.        
	Joshi and parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Kumar Bansal turned up at Mukherjees residence for the meeting, which is understood to have decided to introduce the bill in the winter session after incorporating a few changes.        
	An official in Joshis ministry, which is piloting the bill, said the government was working on a face-saver for Mamata too. All I can say is that the farmers will be getting a much better compensation package, he said.        
	Joshi played down Mamatas absence, saying: Mamata Banerjee is a senior colleague and her opinions are highly valued. Her concerns will be taken with due seriousness.        
	The Congress wants to hurry the bills because it wants to showcase the second of them  the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill  as a model law offering consultation, profit-sharing, alternative land, jobs and livelihood planning to land-losers.        
	The government believes that mere cash compensation does not solve livelihood problems and that land-losers must be offered land and earning options too. The urgency for the rehabilitation bill partly stems from the unrest in the tribal states over industries bids to acquire mining and factory land, an issue getting increasingly enmeshed with the Maoist movement.

  - Experts say Indians need to double daily exercise levels to stay fit        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: Indians wishing to stay fit will need to double their levels of daily exercise even if they are now following the existing norms.        
	The first physical activity guidelines meant specifically for Asian Indians, unveiled by medical experts today, prescribe higher frequency, duration and intensity of exercise compared with the existing norms, which are largely based on studies on western populations.        
	Healthy Indians will be asked to engage in 60 minutes of physical activity seven days a week, in contrast to the current norms of 30 minutes for five days. The activity may include brisk walks, aerobic exercise or even at-work exercise. The guidelines include a new recommendation for strengthening muscles that may be achieved by lifting small weights.        
	Indians need a modified exercise plan because of high predisposition to diabetes and heart disease, said Anoop Misra, chairman of the National Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation and one of the 100-odd medical experts and nutrition and exercise specialists from across the country who contributed to the guidelines.        
	But some experts not involved in pencilling the guidelines have said that more evidence is needed to prove beyond doubt that such extra exercise will indeed provide added protection to Indians.        
	Were hoping medical practitioners will adopt these guidelines for their patients, Misra said. The experts have, however, cautioned that people should ideally consult doctors before embarking on an exercise plan.        
	This would be particularly applicable to individuals who have followed sedentary lifestyles for a long time, and to patients with diabetes or known cardiovascular diseases, another doctor in the contributors group said.        
	The guidelines recommend muscle-strengthening exercises three to four times a week for healthy individuals, and twice a week for diabetes patients, using small weights of 1kg to 3kg. The muscles are the primary sites in the body for glucose metabolism, and weak muscles contribute to high sugar and cholesterol, Misra said.        
	The guidelines say the total leisure screen time that children and adolescents spend before computers and TV should be less than two hours a day.        
	An Australian expert consulted for the guidelines said they represent an important milestone towards raising the profile of physical activity and the health of Indians within and outside India. But the physical activity will have to be linked with diet control, said Andrew Hills of the Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane.        
	We see this in Australia: people who exercise sometimes feel they should reward themselves with a chocolate or a muffin, Hills said.        
	The guidelines also recommend moderate-intensity exercise for 30 minutes a day by pregnant women, but to be done only after consulting obstetricians.        
	The new exercise rules follow a similar effort two years ago to redefine obesity for Indians. At that time, experts had revised the standards for labelling Indians overweight or obese, reducing healthy waistlines for men by 12cm (from 102cm to 90cm) and for women by 8cm (from 88cm to 80cm).

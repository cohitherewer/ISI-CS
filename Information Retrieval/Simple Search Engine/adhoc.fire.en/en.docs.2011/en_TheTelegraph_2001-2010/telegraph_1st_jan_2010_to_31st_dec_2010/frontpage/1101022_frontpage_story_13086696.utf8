          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Arjun Munda                          
	Ranchi, Oct. 21: Chief minister Arjun Munda today sought waiving of Rs 500 crore the state owes the Centre towards deployment of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel in Jharkhand for anti-Naxalite operations since 2007.         
	Munda, who met Union home minister P. Chidambaram in New Delhi today, said the state should not be charged for CRPF deployment as the Naxalite issue was a national one.         
	Huge payments like this will impact the states development adversely, he argued.         
	Munda, who met the home minister for the first time today after assuming charge as chief minister, also urged the Centre to reimburse the Rs 105 crore it had to pay the Railway Board towards Government Railway Police (GRP) expenditure. This cost is shared by the state and railways on a 50:50 basis.         
	Maintaining that he was committed to eliminating Naxalites, the chief minister also sought a one-time grant of Rs 300 crore for strengthening the Special Task Force on the lines of the Grey Hounds in Andhra Pradesh.        
	The critical component of training, both basic and specialised, need to be addressed urgently, he said. Munda added that the home minister was positive and assured all central assistance.        
	Munda also requested the home minister to allow construction of PCC roads in forest areas as a special dispensation for rebel strongholds. Improvised explosive devices planted on kuccha roads have been a major cause of casualties, he said.        
	The chief ministers wish list included the demand for sanctioning 257 companies of central paramilitary forces for the panchayat elections, being held in the state after a gap of 33 years. The state has requisitioned 257 companies, but only 100 have been sanctioned. In view of the number of booths, all in rural and Naxalite-affected areas, 100 companies of CRPF are inadequate, the chief minister maintained.         
	He wanted two helicopters to be made available to the state as soon as possible in view of the panchayat elections and anti-Naxalite operations.        
	He also sought inclusion of six more districts of Santhal Pargana  Dumka, Deoghar, Sahebganj, Godda, Jamtara and Pakur  in the security related expenditure scheme because of the presence of Maoist groups in these districts.        
	Chidambaram was requested to urge the telecommunication ministry to link 840 villages, not covered with mobile connectivity, in view of the panchayat elections.

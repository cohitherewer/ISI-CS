  How tactics shredded talent
                            
	Unknown to Theo Zwanziger at the time, the president of the all-powerful German football federation had laid the foundation for Germanys latest destruction of Argentina all the way back on August 1, 2004.        
	That was when Zwanziger took the gamble of not only appointing the idiosyncratic, California-based Jurgen Klinsmann as national coach but agreeing to accept all his demands on the teams administrative reorganisation and personnel.                        German coach Joachim Loew (top); Miroslav Klose,who scored a brace to celebrate his 100th appearance for Germany. Klose is now second on the all-time list of highest World Cup scorers with 14 goals. (AFP)      
	One such demand was the appointment of Joachim Loew as Klinsmanns assistant.        
	Joachim who? was the reaction of much of the German media. Loew had played a handful of times in midfield for the under-21s, had sunk with barely a trace out of the Bundesliga and returned later  and only briefly  as lucky cup-winning coach of Stuttgart.        
	An Austrian league title with Tirol Innsbruck mattered little more than his sackings from relegated Karlsruhe and from Fenerbahce and Adanaspor in Turkey. But on a coaching course, Loew had had the good fortune to meet Klinsmann who would later remember that fellow student with a remarkable tactical brain.        
	Klinsmann brought Jogi into the German national team set up to spy on players, run training sessions and plan the tactics. Loew, quiet and studious but firm and decisive, impressed players and officials  and Zwanziger.        
	Thus, when Klinsmann resigned after the third-place finish in the 2006 World Cup, Loew was promoted to the top job. He guided Germany to a better-than-expected runners-up spot at the 2008 European Championship and is repeating that trick at the pinnacle of the game in South Africa.        
	Loew is different. He proved the point after the 4-1 dismissal of England in Bloemfontein in the second round. Most coaches sit down at the media conference and spout a string of clichd platitudes. Loew, instead, explained calmly and lucidly  without a hint of triumphalism  how he had studied Englands style and players and worked out the tactics to rip them apart, piece by tiny piece.        
	That same attention to detailed preparation was evident in the manner in which Germany shredded the far more talented opposition in Argentina under the delighted gazes of Germanys Chancellor Angela Merkel and injured ex-captain Michael Ballack.        
	Germany not only ramped up their game magisterially beyond the quality of their England performance but utterly nullified the threat of the most gifted and focused individual talent of the finals, Leo Messi.        
	Thomas Muller, scorer of two of the goals which destroyed England, scored the first in only the third minute from a right-wing raid. All the other three goals were generated from movements down the other side which Loew had identifed as Argentinas vulnerable flank.        
	It is impossible to resist the old national stereotypes. As the game went on so Argentinas teamwork grew more ragged and their equalising efforts more individualistic. Germanys passing remained cool and accurate and their tactical discipline far more rigorous.        
	Argentina were caught in the same trap as England. They threw men forward, chasing the game in the second half and were slaughtered by Germanys electrifying pace on the counter-attack. Miroslav Klose scored twice and defender Arne Friedrich the other.        
	Loew, then a 26-year-old journeyman professional with modest Freiburg, still remembers watching on television when Germany lost 3-2 to an Argentina inspired by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup final. Since then, Germany have turned the World Cup tables in the 1990 final and the 2006 quarter-finals.        
	Naturally, Loew will draw the greatest satisfaction from this latest reversal.        
	As a footballer, he would not even have dared lace the boots of Diego Maradona. But, in a different context on the Cape Town touchline, it was the Argentinian who was left immobile, grim-faced, outmanoeuvred and outplayed.

  - MoU to aid quicker response during crisis          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Sharma and Paul Catro with the signed MoU. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                        
	Bhubaneswar, April 11: The Commissionerate Police is coming up with a greatly modernised control room to respond to emergency situations.        
	The new modern control room will have three major components including a computer-aided dispatch, automatic vehicle locator and a geographic information system.        
	Such control rooms have earlier been installed in Assam, Mumbai, Gujarat and Calcutta. The control room will be installed by US-based Inter-Act Public Safety Solutions.        
	A memorandum in this regard was signed between police commissioner B.K. Sharma and the sales executive vice-president of Inter-Act Public Safety Solutions, Paul Tatro, here on Friday.        
	The whole concept is to essentially improve the policing system, cut down time and improve the response system, said Sharma, adding that 60 vehicles will be put to use for quicker response.         
	There will be 12 operators to receive distress calls, said Sharma. Its all about providing the fastest, most appropriate response in emergency situations, he added.        
	While the CAD system will guide the police for quick response, the GIS will automatically pinpoint the callers location on a digital map in the CAD system. The automatic vehicle locator will allow patrol cars to be tracked so that the police can identify the officer closest to the spot of crime.        
	The Inter-Act Public Safety Solutions Pvt Ltd is a leading provider of safety and security software used by government agencies and especially by police.         
	The new systems greatly enhance the ability of police to respond to emergency situations, Paul said, adding that the company will be training personnel to man the system on their own. The project is expected to be completed in two months.

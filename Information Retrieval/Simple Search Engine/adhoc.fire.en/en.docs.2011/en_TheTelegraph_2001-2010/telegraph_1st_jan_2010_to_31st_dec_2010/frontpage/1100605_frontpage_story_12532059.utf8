  - Team Obama taps Mark Twain, Max Mueller amp; jokes to remove doubts           K.P. NAYAR                             Obama cracks the platter joke, evoking laughter from Clinton and Krishna (PTI)                                         
	Washington, June 4: Announcing his plans to visit India in November, US President Barack Obama yesterday held out the promise of history that we will make together  progress that will be treasured not just by this generation but by generations to come.        
	His typically rousing address at a reception by secretary of state Hillary Clinton for visiting external affairs minister S.M. Krishna and a high-level delegation from New Delhi set at rest any doubts that India was not a priority for the Obama administration.        
	I have to go to India, he said on a rare visit to the state department, which he undertook specially to demonstrate his personal commitment to the first Indo-US strategic dialogue which concluded here yesterday. But even more, I am proud to go to India.        
	In a match of wit and intellect in the state departments Benjamin Franklin Room, named after the father of the American foreign service, the President and the secretary of state alternately quoted Mark Twain and Max Mueller on India.        
	Clinton, who spoke first, recalled the American authors description that India is the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend, and the great-grandmother of tradition, and added a feminine touch to the quote by saying: And I love the fact that its mothers.                                       
	Obama then rationalised his decision to go to India this year itself by endorsing what the German Orientalist had said of the country: Whatever sphere of the human mind you may select for your special study, whether it be language, or religion, or mythology, or philosophy, whether it be law or customs, primitive art or science, you have to go to India... some of the most valuable and instructive material of the history of man are treasured up in India and India only.         
	He then added words of his own that are expected to become the signature theme of the preparations and the objective of the US Presidents state visit: So when it comes to the sphere of our work  building a future of greater prosperity, opportunity and security for our people, there is no doubt: I have to go to India.         
	Krishna introduced an emotional element to the proceedings when he spoke about Obamas late mother, Ann Dunham Soetoro, and the transformational impact of innovation and microfinance because of her work in Asia.         
	That is our hope for transforming our economy and society in an equitable, inclusive and sustainable manner, the external affairs minister said.        
	Obama, who is famous for his wooden, inscrutable demeanour at formal meetings, visibly mellowed at Krishnas thoughtful mention of his mothers work in Asia, shifted a little and appeared to grow more involved in the proceedings from that point.        
	Insisting that relations with India are at the highest of priorities for my administration, Obama pointed out that a third of my cabinet has already visited India  not only for the chapatis.        
	The humorous quip about chapatis crept into the speech because he had been told, as the President acknowledged, that a Delhi restaurant had added a Hillary Platter to its menu following the secretary of states visit to India last July.         
	What does it have  chapatis? Obama asked Clinton, who replied: It has got all kinds of things.        
	When he announced his travel plans to India, Obama joked about this restaurants menu again by saying that he looked forward to experiencing all that India and its people and its incredible ancient culture have to offer  and I intend to create an Obama Platter.

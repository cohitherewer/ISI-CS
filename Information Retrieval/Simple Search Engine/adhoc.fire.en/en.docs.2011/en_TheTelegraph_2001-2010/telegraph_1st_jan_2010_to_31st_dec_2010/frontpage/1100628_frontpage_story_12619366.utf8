          AMIT ROY                      The congregation outside the Church of St Michael amp; All Angels after the service in memory of 
  Gayatri Devi.                           
	London, June 27: A moving and affectionate service of thanksgiving for the Rajmata of Jaipur was held at the picturesque Church of St Michael amp; All Angels, Sunninghill, Berkshire, yesterday.        
	Family and friends from India and Britain remembered the erstwhile Maharani, who was ailing in a hospital in London last year but insisted she be flown back by air ambulance to Jaipur where she died nine days later on July 29 at the age of 90.        
	Many of her English friends who paid tribute to her yesterday had shared the Rajmatas passion for polo  indeed the church service was followed by a game, sponsored by the Ganjam jewellery company, at the nearby Guards Polo Club in Windsor Great Park where she had spent many happy afternoons throughout her life.         
	The Maharani was the third wife from 1939 to 1970 of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II (Jai) of Jaipur. He was 58 when he died shortly after collapsing during a polo match in Cirencester in England in 1970. The couples son, Jagat, passed away in 1997.        
	 The Queen and Prince Philip, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Michael of Kent, all sent their representatives yesterday.                          Gayatri Devi.       
	Other polo connected people in church included Lord Cowdray, whose father had been a great friend of the Jaipur royal family.  
	The mood of the service, full of fond memories, a little humour and anecdotes of a life well lived, was summed up by a friend, Michael Butler, a champion polo player, who read: You can shed tears that she is gone, or you can smile because she has lived.         
	One of the highlights was a passage from the Gayatri Mantra, raising awareness and dispelling the darkness, that was sung with a remarkable command of Sanskrit by Chloe Goodchild, an Englishwoman. The Jaipur family was led by the Rajmatas second stepson, Maharaj Jai Singh (Joey), who read a passage from the Bhagvad Gita.         
	He explained doctors had been doubtful about my mother coming to England last year (because of her poor health) but she said she had been coming to London every year since the age of 16 except for the war years. She wanted to see her friends for the last time.        
	The order of service was carefully arranged to be non-denominational by another polo playing friend, Lord Patrick Beresford, a former Guards officer and a long time senior member of the Guards Polo Club.         
	He said Gayatri Devi was known in her circle in England always as Ayesha  as in Ayesha, the Return of She, the gothic novel by the Victorian author H. Rider Haggard, published in 1905.        
	The church rippled with laughter as he said the character in the novel was not unlike the Maharani  She Who Must Be Obeyed.        
	In his address, Lord Patrick (as he is called), recounted a number of complicated anecdotes where the dramatic personae included an Englishman who was known by his nickname of what sounded like Loopy. Any moment it seemed further cast members such Bertie Wooster, Gussie Fink-Nottle, Roderick Glossop, Pongo Twistleton and assorted regulars of the Drones Club would all stagger in.                  Maharaj Jai Singh, the late Rajmata rsquo;s second stepson, who read a passage from the Bhagvad Gita, during the service       
	In the clash between the Rajmata and Indira Gandhi, Lord Patrick left no doubt which side he was on. Mrs Gandhi, who had locked up Ayesha during the emergency in a stinking hole with a drain running through her cell, was mercifully swept out of power and the new government dismissed all the trumped up charges against the Maharani. (Lord Patrick, the Rajmatas friend for 58 years, forgot to mention that not long afterwards Mrs Gandhi got swept back into power).        
	For an outwardly bluff British soldier, Lord Patricks choice of music was exceptionally sensitive  Ayesha would have approved (though, this being Wimbledon fortnight, the Rajmata, given the choice of going to tennis or attending her own thanksgiving service, would almost certainly have chucked the church service, Lord Patrick laughed).        
	Music before the service included The Flower Song from Carmen by Bizet, and the Waltz and the Dance of the Swans from Swan Lake by Tchaikovsky.         
	After the enchanting entrance hymn, Morning Has Broken, there were readings from the Corinthians, Chapter 13, by Mark Shand, the Duchess of Cornwalls brother who shared an interest in elephant welfare with the Rajmata, and by Pamela, Dowager Lady Egremont, another of her friends.        
	The printed order of service used two photographs of the Rajmata from her younger days when she was hailed by Vogue as one of the most beautiful women in the world.        
	 The caption read: From this whole world, the loveliest and the best has smiled and said goodbye.        
	The congregation filed out to bright sunshine on an English summers day to three of the Maharanis choices when she had appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme, Desert Island Discs, in 1984  Moon River, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square and My Way.

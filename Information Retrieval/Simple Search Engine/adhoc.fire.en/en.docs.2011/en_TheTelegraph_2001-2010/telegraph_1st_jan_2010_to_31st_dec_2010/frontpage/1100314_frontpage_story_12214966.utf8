  - MAOISTS MAY STRIKE BIG, WARNS INTELLIGENCE REPORT          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                            CRPF personnel loading equipment on trucks at their base camp in Ranchi on Saturday. Picture by Prashant Mitra                                        
	Ranchi, March 13: Security forces in Jharkhand are getting ready to extend ongoing operations against Maoists to other areas amid central intelligence reports warning the state that rebels were planning a big strike to try and coerce the Shibu Soren government into beginning unconditional talks.        
	A day after the CRPF top brass, including DG Vikram Shrivastava and special DG and commander of the anti-Naxalite task force Vijay Raman, chaired meetings with the state DGP Neyaz Ahmed and his team to fine tune strategy, senior police officials in the state confirmed that another round of a coordinated offensive could begin in less than a week.        
	The anti-Naxalite operations are a part of the ongoing process. Co-ordinated operations in new areas in the coming days, too, cannot be ruled out. But, we are not going to divulge names of such places, said IG (operations) D.K. Pandey.        
	Along with ongoing internal operations in Saranda forests of West Singhbhum and the hilly terrains of Jhumra in Bokaro, the first phase of joint operations with Bengal were conducted in Ghatshila sub-division of East Singhbhum.        
	As many as 25 companies of paramilitary forces, including CRPF and COBRA commandos had been used, along with choppers and anti-landmine vehicles. Senior police officers of both states confirmed that the first phase was more exploratory in nature with the jawans using the opportunity to get familiarised with the terrain.         
	In Bokaro, security forces met with some success with the arrest of four Maoists and the seizure of 1.6 tonne explosives and Rs 4 lakh in cash.         
	State police sources revealed they were studying a central intelligence report that suggested the Maoists would resort to some treacherous strategum in Jharkhand to try and pressure the state government into beginning some kind of negotiations.        
	Soren is held in high esteem by a number of Maoist idealogues. They see him like a B.R. Ambedkar and Jyotiba Phule who fought for the rights of Dalits, said source close to Maoist leader now lodged in jail.         
	Soren is also seen to be fighting for the rights of poor tribals. If peace talks begin in Jharkhand, it would hit the progress of Operation Greenhunt in other states, he said.

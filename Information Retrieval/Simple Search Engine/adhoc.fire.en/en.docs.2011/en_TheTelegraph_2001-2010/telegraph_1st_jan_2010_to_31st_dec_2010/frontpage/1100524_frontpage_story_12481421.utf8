  - Brothers agree to bury hatchet in the name of the father          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                     
	Mumbai, May 23: The scrapping Ambani brothers have called a truce, agreeing to abandon a set of non-competition arrangements that were reached in January 2006.         
	After the New Deal between the brothers, the exclusive domains of operation earmarked under the contours of a settlement drawn up by mother Kokilaben carving up Dhirubhais empire stand abolished.        
	This means they are free to compete  or fight in the marketplace  in all areas except gas-based power generation that has been demarcated as an exclusive preserve for the Anil camp until March 31, 2022, respecting the 17-year exclusivity period set out under the old arrangement.         
	In identical press releases, the two sides said they had entered into a simpler, non-compete agreement with respect to only gas-based power generation, vowing to fulfil the vision of their father, Dhirubhai.         
	The agreements have been reached between the operating companies: Reliance Industries in the Mukesh camp, and four Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group companies  Reliance Communications, Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, Reliance Natural Resources Ltd, and Reliance Capital. All these companies were signatories to the earlier arrangement as well.         
	The Anil group, however, had contested several provisions of the old agreement because the non-compete pact had been signed when all the companies were still nominally under the control of Reliance Industries (RIL).         
	The rapprochement comes a fortnight after a Supreme Court verdict that upheld the governments ownership of the gas pumped out of the Krishna-Godavari basin and its right to decide who could receive it and at what price.         
	Sundays arrangement will allow RIL to dip into its nearly $5-billion cash chest and invest it in areas from which the Mukesh camp was barred till 2016.         
	The decision to scrap the non-compete agreement between the two brothers will remove several problems of interpretation over this agreement that impacted the business decisions of both the groups. For instance, Reliance Industries will now be able to sell telecom products along with grocery items through its retail outlets, analyst S.P. Tulsian said.         
	 The press releases said RIL and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) will expeditiously negotiate gas supply arrangement in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Court. We hope to conclude these negotiations very soon.         
	The two sides hoped that the steps taken would eliminate any room for further disputes between the two groups.         
	The fight had gone out of Anil after the verdict. The Mukesh camp had also sent out clear signals that it wished to settle the dispute once for all. Both brothers had met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and initiated peace talks.         
	The non-compete arrangement had marked out telecom, power generation and distribution, financial services including banking and insurance, media and entertainment, city gas distribution in Mumbai and Delhi and airport infrastructure for the younger Anil.         
	It had earmarked oil and gas exploration, petroleum refining, petrochemicals and textiles exclusively for the Mukesh camp.

  - 3-month deadline to act on 1000 cases        AMIT GUPTA                                     
	Ranchi, Oct. 28: The state government today fixed a three-month deadline to wrap up investigations and take action in over 1,000 corruption cases pending against bureaucrats and technocrats in what is being seen as a the biggest ever crackdown on graft in Jharkhand ever since its formation in 2000.        
	At a marathon meeting of secretaries of all 42 government departments and senior officials, chief secretary Ashok Kumar Singh fixed the deadline to set a time-frame to ensure action was taken against those found guilty.         
	If departmental proceedings have already been concluded in some cases, inquiry officers should submit the final fact-finding report within a month. In cases of FIRs wherein conviction has been ordered by any court of law, suspension proceedings of the concerned government servant should be initiated soon, said a senior official quoting the chief secretary.         
	Moreover, in other reported cases of alleged corruption, department heads were to look into whether an FIR had been lodged by the police or whether departmental proceedings had been initiated.         
	In case of pending FIRs, departmental heads were now expected to keep track on filing of police charge-sheets, thereby ensuring that delays in connivance with unscrupulous officials were eliminated.        
	The road construction department is likely to be the worst hit after todays crackdown as action was pending in as many as 200 corruption cases. In 104 cases, FIRs had been lodged against erring engineers, while in 96 cases departmental proceedings were on.         
	In case of 44 engineers of the road construction department and four officials of the mines department, directives have been issued to take immediate action, said road construction secretary N.N. Sinha, who is also looking after the mines and geology department.         
	In case of departments like rural development and panchayati raj and NREP (National Rural Employment Programme) that are directly linked to the development of rural areas, as many as 29 cases were pending against erring BDOs and engineers.         
	Rural development secretary Santosh Kumar Satpathy said some cases were as old as nine years with FIRs having been filed but no follow up action initiated. The cases are pending for several reasons. In many cases departmental proceedings are going on. But now we need to dispose of all such cases, Satpathy, who also holds rural works and panchayati raj amp; NREP departments, told The Telegraph.        
	In case of the drinking water and sanitation department, officials conceded follow up action on as many as 25 departmental proceedings and nine FIRs were pending which meant erring officials had escaped punishment.        
	Two long-pending cases of the transport department pertain to bribes being accepted by motor vehicle inspectors. Vigilance bureau had lodged FIRs against them and their prosecution has been sanctioned. Now we need to expedite departmental proceedings and take a final decision, said transport commissioner Satendra Singh.         
	Todays meeting, which began at 9.15 am and was on till late evening, was attended by finance secretary Sukhdev Singh, personnel secretary Aditya Swaroop and several other senior officials.

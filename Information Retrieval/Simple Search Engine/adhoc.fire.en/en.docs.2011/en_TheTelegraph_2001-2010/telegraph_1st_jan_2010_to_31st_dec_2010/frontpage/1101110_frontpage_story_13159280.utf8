                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Six more fall to NDFB vendetta
  - Outfit warns of killing spree        OUR BUREAU                            Bodies of victims of Mondays firing in Tezpur on Tuesday. Picture by Eastern Projections                                         
	Nov. 9: The anti-talks faction of the NDFB shot dead six more persons since last night, taking its revenge killing toll to 22, and threatened to target more Indians, prompting Dispur to consider an integrated operation against the outfit in the forests of Arunachal Pradesh.         
	After killing 16 people till last evening in Sonitpur, Baksa and Karbi Anglong districts in retaliation to the killing of an NDFB militant in the wee hours yesterday, the outfit gunned down three members of a village defence party at Majbat in Udalguri district late last night.        
	They also shot dead 25-year-old Puran Mandol at Dumgaon in Chirang district.         
	This morning, around 11am, rebels gunned down one Tilak Poddar at Ultapani Bazar in Kokrajhar district.        
	They struck again tonight, opening fire on villagers at Daoraighat in Kokrajhar around 8pm.        
	One Faizuddin Sheikh died in the firing.         
	The attack came apparently for the gaonburas (village headmen) failure to collect Rs 700 each from the villagers to pay the outfit.        
	Seven others, including a woman, were injured and have been admitted to the district civil hospital.        
	Around 9pm, gunmen shot at one Md Hussain Ali at Karigaon along National Highway 31 C. He was also admitted to the civil hospital.        
	The Assam government has announced Rs 5 lakh as ex gratia to the next of kin of those who have been killed.         
	The attacks outraged the Hindustani Purbottor Sammelan into calling an Assam bandh tomorrow to protest the brutality. Both the AGP and the BJP have decided to support the bandh.        
	A delegation of the Opposition, led former chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, visited the affected areas.         
	Dispur also rushed two senior cabinet ministers  health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and irrigation minister Nur Jamal Sarkar  to the violence-affected areas in Sonitpur district.         
	Sarma said the government was in favour of launching an integrated operation against the NDFB militants in the forests of the neighbouring state.         
	It is easier for them (NDFB), as they sneak into the dense forests of Arunachal Pradesh after indulging in violence in Assam. We are thinking of launching an integrated operation against them in Arunachal Pradesh jointly with the government in that state, he said.         
	The strategy group of the Unified Command, headed by chief secretary N.K. Das, that met this afternoon, has decided to step up counter-insurgency operations and provide security to sections vulnerable to attacks from the anti-talks NDFB group.         
	We had information but the stray and indiscriminate nature of attacks reflect the frustration of the group. We will be reworking our strategy, a source said.         
	Security forces also busted an NDFB camp at Jingibeel area in Udalguri district and engaged in a gunbattle with a group of militants suspected to be involved in yesterdays killing of three persons in the Mazbat area.         
	The outfit, however, threatened to target more and more Indians if the Indian Occupational Forces (IOF)  an acronym used by the outfit to denote central forces and the army  continued to brutally murder innocent civilians from the Bodo community.         
	Calling from an undisclosed location, B. Fotpangsa, a central executive member and senior leader of the outfit, said: The outfits cadres will continue to target Indians if the Centre and state government do not shun their imperialistic attitude over the Bodos.         
	The outfit had on November 1 threatened to kill 20 Indians for every member of the community killed in fake encounters.         
	The NDFB leader also claimed that Maheswar Basumatary, who had been killed at Laudungi of Batasipur under Dhekiajuli police station during a fake encounter in the wee hours of Monday by a joint team of army and police was a simple farmer and not an NDFB cadre.         
	Various Bodo organisations, including the All Bodo Students Union, and BTC deputy chief Kampha Borgoyary, have condemned the killings by the outfit.        
	Reshuffle        
	A reshuffle in the police department was effected this evening, with G.P. Singh, IGP (security) being posted as IGP (northern range) and A.P. Tewari as Sonitpur SP.         
	They replaced S.N. Singh and Jitmal Doley respectively.        
	Debojit Deuri replaced Tewari as SP, Udalguri.         
	Doley has been posted to railway police. Mukesh Sahay has been posted as additional DGP (law and order) but will continue to hold charge of the CID as well.

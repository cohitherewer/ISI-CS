	Seoul, Dec. 23 (Reuters): North Korea warned today of a holy war against the South using its nuclear deterrent as South Korean President Lee Myung-bak vowed a merciless counterattack if its territory is attacked again.         
	Both sides were raising the rhetoric on a day South Korea launched major land and sea military exercises, prompting North Korea to denounce its richer neighbour as a warmonger.         
	To counter the enemys intentional drive to push the situation to the brink of war, our revolutionary forces are making preparations to begin a holy war at any moment necessary based on nuclear deterrent, North Koreas KCNA news agency quoted minister of armed forces Kim Yong-chun telling a rally in Pyongyang.         
	North Korea regularly threatens to destroy the South and its major ally, the US, and has wielded the threat of its nuclear deterrent before, despite analysts saying it has no way to launch a nuclear device.        
	Lee said on a tour of a South Korean forward army base overlooking North Korean territory that the South would not relax its readiness to counter any aggression by the North. We had believed patience would ensure peace on this land, but that was not the case, Lee, criticised for perceived earlier weakness to North Korean attacks, told troops.        
	South Korea held a major land drill in the Pocheon region, between Seoul and the heavily armed demilitarised zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas. It also continued naval live-fire exercises 100km south of the maritime border with North Korea.        
	The drill involves a larger scale of firepower and personnel than usual for an exercise at the army training ground, a further indication that Lee wants to show the public his government can stand up to the North.        
	A large contingent of mechanised units operating tanks, three dozen self-propelled artillery, fighter jets and multiple rocket launchers, took part in the live-fire drill just miles from the border. It lasted just under an hour.         
	Lee has replaced his top defence officials with more hawkish military men.

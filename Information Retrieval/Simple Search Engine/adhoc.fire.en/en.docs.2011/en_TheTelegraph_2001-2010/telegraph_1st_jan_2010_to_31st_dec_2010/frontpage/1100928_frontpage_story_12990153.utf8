                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Kashmir schools open but attendance thin 
  - Curiosity and an opportunity to chat bring friends back to class though scare of attack looms         MUZAFFAR RAINA                      Students row a boat on their way to school in Srinagar on Monday. (AP)                                
	Srinagar, Sept. 27: Mohammad Aatif, a Class XI student, today trudged 10km from Nowshera to Tyndale Biscoe school in the city centre, past downtown that was deserted but for dozens of barricades and security men.        
	Accompanied by his father, Aatif (name changed) was one of the few who turned up in school in spite of curfew and Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelanis appeal to parents to keep children home and show the world that people prefer azaadi (freedom) over everything in Kashmir.        
	The Omar Abdullah governments first serious effort to bring back a semblance of normality by reopening schools succeeded, but only just. Both the government and the separatists monitored student attendance as though an election-day drama were playing out, but the turnout was low.        
	In my class, not more than 10 out of 70 students turned up. In the lower classes, the attendance was far less, Mohammad Aatif said. Biscoe was one of a handful of private schools that opened in Srinagar, most others staying shut.        
	So did Mohammad Aatif mean to defy Geelanis call? Not really. I am for azaadi. My exams are due to start soon, so I was here to get an assignment from my teachers. My school has been shut for weeks now and there is something called curiosity that also brought me to school, he said.        
	I have not seen my friends for quite some time and I thought we would meet and chat, said Mohammad Aatifs friend, who refused to reveal his name.        
	One of the parents dropped his child near the school gate, only to call him back in seconds. Let us go back. Some (school) bus has been targeted, he screamed, although several policemen were posted at the gates.        
	The government made elaborate arrangements, asking state-owned buses to ply on several routes and treat school uniforms as students curfew passes. Security personnel were instructed to ensure student safety. The heads of all government schools were directed to be present.        
	Nearly half the staff did come up but we had only a handful of students. Several policemen in civvies came to our school to see the attendance. I told them every teacher is present, the head of a government school in Ganderbal district said.        
	Officials said most government schools opened today but some school buses were attacked in Habbak, Machoo and Pindchi Mandi near Tatoo Ground. Some miscreants stopped a car at Wanabal and took away Rs 43,000 and a mobile phone from a parent, a police spokesperson said.        
	State education minister Peerzada Mohammad Sayeed claimed there was 90 per cent attendance in rural areas and 30-40 per cent in cities and towns.         
	Students came out despite harassment at several places. Parents are interested in sending their wards to schools. Around 90-100 per cent of the teaching and non-teaching staff reported for duty. I hope from tomorrow student attendance increases, he said.

          JACQUI GODDARD                            Clooney in Los Angeles. (AP)                                  
	Los Angeles, Jan. 23: A roll call of stars, including Madonna, Beyonc and Tom Cruise, joined host George Clooney for a telethon to raise funds for victims of the Haiti earthquake.        
	A quarter of a century after Live Aid, 140 of the biggest names in music and entertainment united once more at the telethon.         
	In a restrained and distinctly non-glitzy event broadcast from closed studios in Los Angeles, New York and London, stars dressed in sombre tones performed solemn songs and delivered tributes to the victims of the western hemispheres worst natural disaster.        
	The Hope for Haiti Now telethon, organised in just one week by Clooney in association with Haitian-American musician Wyclef Jean, featured singers, including Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, Bono, Coldplay, Rihanna, Sting, Stevie Wonder and Sheryl Crow, and addresses from former President Bill Clinton, Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Nicole Kidman and Samuel L. Jackson.        
	In the background, Hollywoods finest manned the telephones  such as director Stephen Spielberg and actors Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Julia Roberts, Mel Gibson and Penelope Cruz.        
	This is a tragedy that reaches across all borders, all boundaries. It demands our attention, our help and our compassion, Clooney said. The Haitian people need help. They need to know that they are not alone. They need to see that we still care, he added, as millions of donors snarled up the telephone lines.              
	Funds were also collected via text messaging and over the internet, which streamed the two-hour live global broadcast.        
	In the US, programming was wiped out across 25 networks, and MTV made it available in 640 million homes worldwide.        
	None of the star faces were introduced, with the format focusing instead on the heartbreak in Haiti.        
	Clint Eastwood and Matt Damon led a tribute to United Nations staff killed in the earthquake; an orphanage worker recounted how he had turned away 80 children a month even before the disaster and now feared that there would be so many more; a little girl rescued from beneath the ruins sat wide-eyed before the cameras in Port au Prince as CNN reporter Anderson Cooper told how she lost ten members of her family and now lived on the streets.        
	Actress Halle Berry narrated the tale of Monley, a five-year-old boy who survived more than a week trapped under concrete, curled up in a ball.        
	 quot;For eight days he had no one to comfort him, no one to tell him that they loved him, and no one to tell him that things were going to be all right, quot; she said, her voice trembling.        
	 quot;He had no one because the earthquake had claimed the lives of his mother and father. quot;        
	Proceeds from the telethon were still being tallied yesterday. They will be shared between Oxfam America, Partners in Health, the Red Cross, UNICEF, the UN World Food Programme, Wyclef Jeans Yele Haiti Foundation, and the Clinton Bush Haiti Foundation.        
	The event quot;was a case study in giving it all, while holding it all back quot;, the New York Times concluded, adding: quot;Overall it was an effective trade-off: an excess of restraint in the pursuit of extravagant generosity. quot;              THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

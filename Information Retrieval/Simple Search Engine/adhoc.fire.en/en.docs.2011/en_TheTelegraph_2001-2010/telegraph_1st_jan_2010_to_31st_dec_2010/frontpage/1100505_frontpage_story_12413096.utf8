	Ranchi, May 4: JMM legislators today decided to continue with the NDA, thus succumbing to the BJP diktat to either extend support to it or face its withdrawal of support.        
	After a three-hour-long closed door meeting at the chief ministers residence, the 14 MLAs reportedly reposed their faith in the JMM leadership and gave it the green signal to remain in the NDA. Chief minister Shibu Soren also attended the meeting.        
	Two dissenting MLAs  Simon Marandi and Teklal Mahto  however, skipped the meeting along with Torpa MLA Paulus Surin, who is lodged in Simdega jail.         
	Sita Soren, the Jama MLA and Sorens daughter in law, was missing as well.         
	Simon and Teklal are of the view that the JMM should shift to the Congress camp if the BJP did not accept Soren as chief minister.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph after the meeting, Hemant said the MLAs reiterated their faith in the NDA and decided to strengthen it further. We have not backed out from our promise to hand over the baton to BJP to lead the government, he reiterated.        
	Soren junior added they would hold meetings with the BJP central leadership soon to find a way forward. He stressed that there was no debate on Guruji contesting the polls.        
	Though Hemant would not spell it out in so many words, a senior JMM leader said the decision to continue with the NDA meant that the party would extend support to the BJP to form the government, a condition set by the central BJP leadership to the JMM to save the alliance.         
	When we have decided to continue with the NDA, the follow up action like submitting the letter of support to the BJP is a mere formality, the JMM leader maintained.        
	The JMM also formed a six-member committee to coordinate with the BJP. The committee would be headed by Hemant. The other members of the committee are Hemlal Murmu, Haji Hussain Ansari, Nalin Soren, Shashank Shekhar Bhokta and Mathura Prasad Mahto.        
	Meanwhile, the Congress too explored the possibility of fishing in troubled waters.         
	Twelve out of 14 MLAs led by Congress state president Pradeep Balmuchu met Ahmed Patel, political secretary to Sonia Gandhi, in New Delhi and discussed the scenario arising out of the current political crisis.        
	Patel, according to Balmuchu, asked the Congress MLAs to wait and watch.         
	Balmuchu said the BJP was fully responsible for the political crisis created out of its lust for power. He also alleged that the BJP was blackmailing the JMM.         
	The crisis has halted development in the state, forcing government officials to assess the emerging political situation instead of doing their jobs, Congress spokesman Shailesh Sinha said, adding the BJP was fuelling rumours of impending Presidents rule in order to keep the ruling alliance intact.        
	The MLAs who met Patel were Rajendra Prasad Singh, Sarafraj Ahmed, Sawna Lakra, Saurabh Narayan Singh, Gopal Sharan Nath Shahdeo, K.N. Tripathy, Banna Gupta, Geeta Shree Oraon, Rajesh Ranjan, Mannan Mallick, Yogendra Sao and Anant Pratap Deo.

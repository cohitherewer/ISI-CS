          ARCHIS MOHAN                                               
	New Delhi, March 18: The Centre adopted a carrot-and-stick policy in an attempt to push through an interim solution to the Gorkha issue at todays tripartite talks in the capital.         
	It offered the carrot of unlimited development funds for the new interim autonomous authority it has proposed for the Darjeeling hills  an attractive prospect for an out of power Gorkha Janmukti Morcha.         
	The Centres stick came in the shape of a veiled warning to the Morcha  reach an agreement on the interim autonomous authority by the next two tripartite meetings, else wait for Bengal Assembly elections to be over.         
	The Union home ministry  which perceives itself to be a referee between the Morcha and Bengal government  felt that by the end of the first round of tripartite talks at the political level, the Morcha leaders seemed much more amenable towards inking an agreement on the powers and structure of a new interim autonomous authority for the Darjeeling hills by mid-May, or at worst, at the meeting after that. The proposed interim authority will remain in place till December 31, 2011.         
	In Darjeeling, Morcha president Bimal Gurung sounded hopeful of reaching an agreement soon. He said: A few rounds of discussion would be needed to settle the issue of interim arrangement.         
	 The Centre is willing to allocate sufficient money for the development of the area. We promise to give money to any interim set-up established in a mutually agreeable manner between the state government and the GJM (Morcha). We believe development should not be hampered because of political uncertainty, said Union minister of state for home Ajay Maken after the talks concluded in the capital today.         
	The Centre also wanted the Morcha to abjure violence, including blockading highways till the talks were on. However, the Morcha did not offer any assurances on that count.         
	The three stakeholders at the meeting  the Centre represented by Maken and Trinamul Congress minister of state for health Dinesh Trivedi; the Gorkhas represented by an eight-member delegation led by party general secretary Roshan Giri; and Bengal governments representatives, ministers Asok Bhattacharya and Surjya Kanta Mishra representing  decided to meet again in mid-May in New Delhi after the current Parliament session is over on May 7.         
	All three sides described the two-hour long talks as cordial. They also agreed that a permanent solution to the Gorkha issue in the current times of political uncertainty in Bengal was not possible, and an interim authority should be established at the earliest to lessen the sufferings of the people.         
	Two sets of draft proposals on the shape of the interim autonomous authority were discussed. For the first time, the Morcha handed over its draft proposal for the interim authority to the Bengal government. It had sent the draft to the Centre earlier. We will give our opinion after studying the Morcha proposal, said minister Bhattacharya.         
	On its part, the Centre has already handed its draft proposal to the Morcha and the Bengal government. Home ministry sources claimed that the draft had the state governments backing. The Centres formula provides for an autonomous interim set-up with lesser powers than what the Morcha has demanded in its draft.         
	Both the Centre and the state are unwilling to accept the Morcha proposal. They have asked for the moon. It is impossible to accede to all their demands. We hope the Morcha and us will soon agree on commonalties, said a senior official.         
	The home ministry feels that it will be in the Morchas interest to agree upon the contours of the internal set-up at the earliest. Setting up the new authority will take time. Local body elections will take time. We will not be able to allocate funds once the model code of conduct kicks in before the West Bengal elections in mid-2011. It will be in the Morchas interest to agree to a draft proposal at the earliest, said an official. The official said the composition of the interim set- up, for example the number of elected representatives, was negotiable. We are willing to increase the number of elected representatives, he said.         
	The Morcha delegation also came out amenable to an interim arrangement. The leaders, however, iterated their demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland. We will discuss the interim set-up in our next meeting in mid-May. However, we object to Asok Bhattacharyas comments in the meeting appealing to us to remain in West Bengal. We arent ready to move an inch from our demand for a separate state, said Giri.         
	The Centre said substantial development funds for the Darjeeling hills had remained unspent because of the absence of any political structure. ( )

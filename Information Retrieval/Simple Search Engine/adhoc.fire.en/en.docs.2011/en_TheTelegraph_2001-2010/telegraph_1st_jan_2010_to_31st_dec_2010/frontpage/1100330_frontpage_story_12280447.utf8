The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | In fire-hit city, ministry will not burn cash
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                In fire-hit city, ministry will not burn cash
  - Squad cries for boots, funds lie unused        ANINDYA SENGUPTA AND ZEESHAN JAWED                                                    
	Calcutta, March 29: Fire-resistant jackets, oxygen masks, extra helmets, new gum boots         
	Just a few of the life and limb-saving equipment the citys firefighters are denied because fire minister Pratim Chatterjees department will not unzip its purse of Rs 30 crore.        
	Allocated Rs 62 crore in the past two years budgets, the department has spent only half the amount.        
	All this while, its officials have been clamouring for basic tools to combat big fires, such as fireproof jackets, masks with oxygen cylinders, breaking gear, portable pumps, ceiling hooks and jumping cushions.        
	The officials have been urging Chatterjee to acquire these equipment but without success, a fire department source said.        
	He said that while a skylift can help firemen reach the top floor or the terrace and rescue trapped people, fireproof jackets or proximity suits and masks with oxygen cylinders allow them to enter spots where a fire is raging.        
	About Rs 30 crore remains unspent, a senior fire official said. This could easily have been spent on these basic equipment had the minister worked out his priorities right.        
	Since 2008, the government has bought a 70-metre skylift for Rs 7 crore, a 54-metre skylift for Rs 5 crore, and 87 fire tenders for around Rs 20 lakh each  the total bill coming to about Rs 30 crore.        
	Although the unspent Rs 30 crore can carry over to the next fiscal, it can lead to budget cuts for the fire department in the current financial year.        
	Fire services secretary P.S. Kathiresan failed to explain clearly why money had been left unspent when his officials were demanding basic equipment.         
	It is a question of priority and not of funds availability, he conceded. We thought that the skylifts were a priority. However, we will definitely buy more firefighting equipment like jackets, jumping cushions and personal protection devices.        
	He didnt have an answer why the skylifts and the basic equipment could not be bought together. We have the money to buy these items, he conceded. This year (2009-10), our budget was Rs 33 crore, which is Rs 4 crore more than the 2008-09 budget.        
	The fire minister refused to be drawn. I wont utter a word on this, Chatterjee said. A lot of politics is going on to malign me. All I can say is that the necessary purchases will be made at the earliest.        
	An official explained that the top officer at the fire headquarters, the director-general, who is an IPS officer, has very little power.        
	He cannot sanction more than a few thousand rupees for a particular expense. If the expense is higher, he has to send the file to Writers for approval from the secretary and the minister. The expense is rarely sanctioned because Writers has hardly any idea about firefighters needs, a senior fire official said.        
	He cited the example of eight snag-ridden bowsers (a kind of fire tender) that are standing idle at the fire headquarters in Free School Street.        
	Each bowser will cost over Rs 1.5 lakh to repair but the director-general cannot sanction more than Rs 10,000. The file requesting sanction for the expense has been lying at Writers for over a year.        
	Similarly, the snagged skylift at the headquarters will never get repaired because the money wont be sanctioned, the official said.        
	The firemen have not even received gum boots for the past two years. Five hundred fire operators (the foot soldiers who actually douse the fires) were recruited in 2008. They are yet to receive their gum boots, a key part of their uniform. When fire operators enter a blaze site, they have to cross spots that are smouldering. The gum boots protect them, a senior fire official said.        
	A pair of gum boots costs Rs 350.        
	None of Calcuttas fire stations has a single extra helmet for the firefighters. A helmet is provided to us at the time of joining. If it gets damaged, we have to apply for a new one, which takes at least two weeks to arrive, a fire operator said at the headquarters.        
	An official said the money at the departments disposal was being spent mindlessly without prioritising its needs.        
	In July 2009, Rs 1.27 crore was sanctioned for a full-fledged wireless system for the department. A sum of Rs 67 lakh has already been paid to Webel (the Bengal governments nodal agency to promote the IT and electronics industries in the state) but we are yet to see any results. We still depend on our cellphones to communicate with the control room, the official said.        
	A CPM leader admitted that the fire department appeared low on the governments priorities given that Chatterjee continued to be fire minister despite his poor record.        
	Leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee said: Calcutta has been growing at a brisk pace and the fire department has assumed a lot of importance, but it continues to be neglected by the government with a minister at the helm who is more interested in drama and film stars than in doing his own job.        
	A Forward Bloc leader said Chatterjee was getting away with lapses because of the quota system in the government, which had earned him a ministers berth despite his party, the Marxist Forward Bloc, having only two MLAs.        
	This is one of the compulsions of coalition politics, a CPM state secretariat member said. There are complaints about him not doing anything even for the benefit of his own firemen.        
	The firemen have long been complaining of poor pay and demanding a risk allowance. Secretary Kathiresan said he was trying to figure out if an insurance scheme could be worked out for the firemen.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Guilty plea on all counts
                          David Headley                    
	Chicago, March 18 (Agencies): David Coleman Headley, the US citizen of Pakistani origin accused of scouting the Mumbai attack targets, today pleaded guilty to all 12 counts he had been charged with.        
	In return for co-operating and testifying against co-defendant Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a Chicago businessman of Pakistani descent, the US justice department agreed as expected not to seek the death penalty for Headley. The department would in any case have found it difficult to get such a sentence from the court.        
	During the 30-minute hearing, the prosecution said Headley would not be extradited to either India or Pakistan. If convicted, Headley faces imprisonment for life.        
	Earlier in the day, home secretary G.K. Pillai had said in Delhi that if he (Headley) is given a light sentence, it would not only be disappointing but we will be registering a very strong protest with the US.        
	Headley, 49, admitted in court that he scouted targets in advance of the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai. He also acknowledged picking out targets for an attack, which did not take place, on a Copenhagen newspaper for publishing controversial cartoons.        
	Headley pleaded guilty to 12 counts  conspiring to bomb public places in India, to murder and maim people in India and Denmark, to provide material support to foreign terrorist plots, to provide material support to the Lashkar-e-Toiba as well as aiding and abetting the murder of US citizens in India. At least six Americans were among the 170 people killed in the 26/11 attacks.        
	Headley, son of a Pakistani diplomat and a Philadelphia socialite, admitted to using his friend Ranas immigration company as a cover for surveillance activities in India and Denmark on behalf of the Lashkar.         
	Rana is also charged in both the Mumbai and Copenhagen plots but had pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism.        
	Wearing an orange jumpsuit and hands and legs shackled, Headley was produced before the court under tight security. Security forces along with sniffer dogs were deployed around the court. Special metal-detector doors were also erected at the entrance to the packed courtroom.

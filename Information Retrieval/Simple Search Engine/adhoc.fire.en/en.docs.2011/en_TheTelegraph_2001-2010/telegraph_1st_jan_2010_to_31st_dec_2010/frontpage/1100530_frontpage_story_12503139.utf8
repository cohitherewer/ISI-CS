  - Strand Warehouse collapse kills three, injures commuters on vote eve
          OUR BUREAU                            The remaining skeleton of the Strand Road warehouse, against the backdrop of the Howrah bridge . (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Calcutta, May 29: A large part of a once-grand warehouse on Strand Road collapsed this evening, killing three persons, injuring eight commuters, reviving memories of a celebrated past and exposing the civic decay a day before the corporation elections.        
	Strand Warehouse  almost the entire third floor and a big portion of the second floor came crashing down at 5.15pm  was declared unsafe six years ago and then tagged hazardous. The warehouse was damaged in a fire on February 14.        
	Chunks of concrete fell on two buses and a taxi.        
	Subhas Chandra Roy, 52, a guard of the warehouse, was among the three who died. The identity of the other two has not been established.        
	The collapse has roots that can be traced to two of the principal players in tomorrows polls. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and police, both of which have washed their hands of responsibility to demolish the unsafe building, are ruled by the Left.        
	The warehouse is the property of the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), part of the Union shipping ministry. The minister of state for shipping is Mukul Roy, a Trinamul MP close to Mamata Banerjee.        
	The CMC had declared the 45,000sqft warehouse, owned by the CPT and let out to several tenants, unsafe in 2004. We pulled down a part of the rear of the building after the fire. The CPT was asked to pull down the front part but they did not take any action, said Debashish Kar, the director-general (building) in the civic body.        
	But why did the CMC not raze the front portion? Because the port trust resisted, said Kar. Outgoing mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya added: Since the CPT resisted the demolition, it should now take responsibility for the disaster.        
	CPT officials, however, said they could not demolish the building as the tenants had obtained a court stay.         
	Local MP Sudip Bandopadhyay of Trinamul, who visited the spot, said: I spoke to Mamata Banerjee and Mukul Roy. Roy told me the port trust was not opposed to demolition.        
	A police officer at Lalbazar said: The police are not empowered to bring down a building suo motu. We can only act as a facilitator if an empowered agency approaches us.

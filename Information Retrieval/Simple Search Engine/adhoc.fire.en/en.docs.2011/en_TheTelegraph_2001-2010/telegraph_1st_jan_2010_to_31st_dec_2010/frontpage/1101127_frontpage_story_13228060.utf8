	New Delhi, Nov. 26: The Opposition wants a joint parliamentary probe not to find out the truth about spectrum allocation but to insult the Prime Minister, the government said today, explaining with some clarity for the first time why it has been rejecting the demand so far.        
	Sushma Swaraj and Gurudas Dasgupta clearly said at the all-party meeting that they wanted to summon the Prime Minister. What role has the Prime Minister in this scam? Why do they want to insult the institution of the PMO? parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal asked.        
	The government is neither running away from a debate nor blocking investigation, he said, but the Opposition was interested only in drawing political mileage. The Congress today got its MPs to decline their daily allowance for the period that Parliament is paralysed. ( )        
	Bansal further said: They (the Opposition) wanted to look into the Niira Radias tapes to find out who influenced the selection of A. Raja as telecom minister. Can any committee be set up to examine cabinet formation? Has it ever happened in the world?        
	Asked if the government would allow a JPC probe if these two demands were abandoned, the minister said: We cannot respond to hypothesis. Right now, they want the JPC for these purposes, which is impossible.        
	The government is planning to call another formal meeting for negotiations.        
	Sources said there was a view in the government that Parliaments ethics committee or parliamentary committee could examine the Radia tapes if the members so desired.        
	If the members think it is a breach of privilege that the selection of a minister was allegedly influenced by journalists or corporate houses, these committees can look into the issue. All journalists mentioned in the tapes and the corporate people can be summoned for interrogation and a report can be submitted to Parliament. The government will accept that proposal, a senior minister said.        
	This is one option the government is looking at to break the Parliament impasse.         
	Another concession it is willing to offer is an opportunity to seek answers from the Prime Minister during a debate on the 2G scam. Although it is not mandatory for him to do so, Manmohan Singh can respond to specific queries.

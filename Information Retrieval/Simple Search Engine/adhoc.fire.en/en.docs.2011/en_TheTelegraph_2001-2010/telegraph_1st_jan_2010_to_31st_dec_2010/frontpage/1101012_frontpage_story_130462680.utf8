                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tendulkar strikes double ton, India all out for 495 
										      
	Bangalore, Oct 12 (PTI): Sachin Tendulkar slammed his sixth double hundred as India took a 17-run lead before being dismissed for 495 in their first innings at lunch on the fourth day of the second cricket Test against Australia here today.
    Tendulkar's 214-run knock helped India wipe out the Australian first innings total of 478 but the match itself seemed headed for a draw.
    India lost five wickets during the morning session with debutant Peter George dismissing Tendulkar (214) and Harbhajan Singh (4).
    Spinner Nathan Hauritz claimed two wickets -- of Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (30) and S Sreesanth (0) -- in his 48th over -- while Watson dismissed Zaheer Khan (1).

          RAJ KUMAR       
	Ranchi, Jan. 15: Around 100 Maoists laid siege to a police picket in Gumla district today, killing five policemen in apparent rebuttal to chief minister Shibu Sorens oft-repeated advocacy of a soft line against rebels to lure them into the mainstream.        
	About 175km from the state capital, the picket, under the Bishnupur police station area close to the tourist destination of Netarhat, came under attack around 3pm.         
	According to sources, after a brief encounter in which one policeman was killed, the others sent word for reinforcements. When that did not arrive, and finding themselves cornered, the policemen tried to flee.        
	The sources said they decided to use a bauxite-laden truck to escape, but the Maoists got wind of the plan and blew it up by using a landmine.        
	After the policemen were cornered in their picket, they asked for reinforcements with the help of a chopper. But before help could reach them, they kept on fighting with the extremists with the weapons they had, a source explained, adding there were only eight policemen in the picket at the time of the attack.        
	By the time additional forces could reach the picket, the Maoists had fled taking with them all the arms and ammunition. The policemen, who reached the picket, the sources added, were still there and had been asked to stay on till next morning at least.        
	Lohardaga SP Subodh Prasad was also sent to Gumla in the evening.        
	State police spokesperson and IG (human rights) V.H. Deshmukh confirmed the incident, but did not agree that there were requests from the trapped policemen to send reinforcements.         
	The jawans were killed in a landmine blast, he said. The blast took place when the jawans were returning to their picket on a bauxite-laden truck at around 3.30pm. In the attack, five policemen and a truck driver was killed. Two others were injured, while one is missing.        
	Gumla SP Narendra Kumar Singh and officer-in-charge of Bishnupur could not be contacted for comments.         
	The five deceased policemen were identified as picket in-charge and ASI Shyam Kishore Singh and constables Gangadhar Mahto, Karma Yadav, Alok Rai and Surendra Nath Swansi.         
	Those injured were constables N. Tiru and S. Lakra. Om Prakash, a havildar, was missing. The driver of the truck has been identified as Birendra Kumar Singh.

  - Fury after Metro passengers get trapped in tunnel          OUR BUREAU                      The Sovabazar station ticket counter that was damaged.   Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                
	Calcutta, Oct. 12: A trainload of Metro passengers today spent 35 minutes trapped in the dark, airless coaches of a non-AC rake whose power supply snapped inside the tunnel, leaving them gasping for breath before the doors opened for them to walk to safety.        
	How could they leave us stranded like that for so long? said Santanu Banerjee, 25, after spending a horror half-hour inside the tunnel between Girish Park and Sovabazar from 6.30pm.        
	Some commuters later ransacked Sovabazar station, targeting the turnstiles, ticket counters, CCTV cameras and even the weighing machines. Police said around six RPF personnel got injured trying to restrain them, and three people were arrested on charges of vandalism.        
	The incident comes on a day Metro was forced to withdraw its two AC rakes because of serial snags ranging from malfunctioning door sensors to a delay in operations caused by a mismatch between new and old technology.        
	A Metro spokesman claimed the first coach of the Dum Dum-bound rake had already reached the Sovabazar platform when the power snag brought the train to a halt. But the passengers said the entire train was stranded in the tunnel.        
	Why else would we have to walk along the track for 15 minutes to reach Sovabazar? demanded Santanu, a brand manager.        
	Nor did Metro explain why the passengers were not escorted to the first coach through the vestibules if the train was indeed partially inside the station.        
	Many passengers said they feared suffocation as the minutes ticked by with no sign of help arriving.        
	The emergency lights above the doors were on but that was hardly enough. The fans werent working. I saw two elderly people and a woman pass out, said college girl Aditi Chattopadhyay.        
	The first announcement over the trains public address system, which is powered by emergency batteries, came about two minutes after the rake stalled. A mechanical fault has stalled the Metro services. Our motorman is checking the problem please be patient, dont get excited (uttejito) unnecessarily, it said.        
	By the time another announcement was made 15 minutes later, some of the passengers were kicking and banging on the trains doors and walls. Two more requests for calm later, the doors finally opened and the passengers were asked to step out and walk towards the station in a single file.        
	An RPF team escorted the passengers, many of whom had difficulty climbing the high platform from the track.

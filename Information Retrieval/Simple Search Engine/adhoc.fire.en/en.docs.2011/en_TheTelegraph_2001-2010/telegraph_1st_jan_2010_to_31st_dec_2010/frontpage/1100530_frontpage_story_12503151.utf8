	Many people were waiting for information on relatives, officially classified as missing, who have not been accounted for after the Jnaneswari Express got derailed on Friday. Their eyes were fixed on coaches S5 and S6, badly mangled and yet to be cut open.        
	As rescuers went to work with gas cutters, Surendra Singh, a Calcuttan, came rushing in, looking for his wife Nilam, sons Rahul, 14, and Rohit, 12, and daughter Khushboo, 6. He could not find any of them among the bodies that emerged from under coaches.        
	Then he turned to the half-cut S6 and wailed: I can see my wifes leg sticking out. My children must also be under it.         
	Till late on Saturday evening, the body Surendra had pointed to had not been identified conclusively.        Work on to slice open coach S6

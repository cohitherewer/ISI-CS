          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                    
	Ranchi, Jan. 12: The Supreme Court today set the stage for holding panchayat elections in Jharkhand, retaining a key but contentious provision in the law that reserves posts of chairpersons for tribals in certain areas in what could prove to be a shot in the arm for the Shibu Soren government that came to power on a pro-tribal agenda.        
	A constitution bench of the apex court, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, today upheld the provisions of the Jharkhand Panchayat Raj Act, 2001, which allowed 100 per cent reservation of seats of chairpersons in all three levels of the panchayat in scheduled, or tribal, areas.        
	Besides, there would be 33 per cent reservation for women in both scheduled and non-scheduled areas.         
	Todays ruling, that quashed the Jharkhand High Court order of September 2, 2005, paves the way for panchayat elections pending in Jharkhand for around three decades.        
	In response to the court order, which also asked the state government to hold local polls at the earliest, both chief secretary Shiv Basant and rural development and panchayat raj secretary S.K. Satpathy promised to get cracking soon.        
	Expressing happiness over the apex courts verdict, Satpathy said the state government was determined to conduct panchayat elections before May.        
	The Jharkhand High Court had declared 100 per cent reservation of seats of panchayat chairpersons at all three tiers in scheduled (tribal) areas as unconstitutional and ultra-vires.         
	In fact, the high courts judgment forced the state government to de-notify panchayat elections scheduled in 2005 in the face of widespread protests by tribal organisations that had taken to the streets asking the then Arjun Munda government to challenge the order in the Supreme Court.        
	The state government had provided for 100 per cent reservation to tribals in scheduled areas in the Jharkhand Panchayat Raj Act, 2001, in pursuance of the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, a central legislation.        
	As many as 12 districts are under scheduled areas where all the posts of chairperson would be reserved  in effect, 100 per cent  for tribals. There are 4,564 panchayats in the state with 2,228 of them under scheduled areas.         
	The Supreme Court said reservation in favour of STs in panchayats at all the three tiers was clearly an example of compensatory discrimination in view of the fact that scheduled areas under consideration were completely under a separate administrative scheme as per the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution.         
	We believe that the case of panchayats in scheduled areas is a fit case that warrants exceptional treatment with regard to reservations. The rationale behind imposing an upper ceiling of 50 per cent in reservations for higher education and public employment cannot be readily extended to the domain of political representation at the panchayat-level in scheduled areas, the apex court ruled.         
	There is a compelling need to safeguard the interests of tribal communities with immediate effect by giving them an effective voice in local self-government, especially in the context of scheduled areas, the court added.         
	Satpathy noted that the number of panchayats would come down as several municipalities had subsumed panchayats in the periphery of urban areas. As many as 49 new blocks had been created in the last two years.         
	So, we will now take a decision whether to form panchayat samities in these newly carved out blocks or not, he explained.        
	Tribal leaders were jubilant at todays order. The Congresss Bandi Oraon, a member of the Bhuria Committee that drafted the bill for PESA, said: The apex court has upheld the act drafted for the security and progress of tribals in Jharkhand. It is now for the state government to ensure their progress.        
	Tribal ideologue Ram Dayal Munda, too, welcomed the ruling. It is an excellent ruling. The hurdle towards decentralisation of democracy has been removed with the ruling of the SC.

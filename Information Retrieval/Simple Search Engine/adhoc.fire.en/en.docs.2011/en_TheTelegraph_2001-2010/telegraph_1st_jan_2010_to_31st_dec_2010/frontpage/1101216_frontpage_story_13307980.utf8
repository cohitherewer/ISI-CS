The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Raids zero in on Kani connections
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Raids zero in on Kani connections
          G.C. SHEKHAR                                              
	Chennai, Dec. 15: The 2G saga appears to be boiling down to one bloodline: several lines are snaking towards the third family of Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi.        
	Among the many raided today by the CBI, the most high profile may have been lobbyist Niira Radia. But the biggest surprises among the raided circle of family and friends were Father Jegath Gaspar, a close associate of Karunanidhis daughter Kanimozhi; V. Rathnam, the auditor of Karunanidhis third wife and Kanimozhis mother Rajathi, and A. Kamaraj, associate editor of Nakkeeran magazine who is very close to both A. Raja and Karunanidhi.        
	The raids on Gaspar, who runs a cultural NGO called Tamil Mayiam, sent shock waves in Chennai as he has been spotted on public platforms with Kanimozhi, who is an MP. The two organise a cultural festival called Chennai Sangamam every January.        
	Kanimozhi, who is a director of Tamil Mayiam, apparently flew into a rage when she heard that Gaspar had been raided, said a government officer who was present in her house at CIT Colony in central Chennai.         
	The frayed tempers have stirred questions about the durability of the DMK alliance with the Congress but the UPA leader is smug in the reading that the southern party needs the partner badly in the upcoming Assembly elections. Another dramatic element was added in the evening when word spread from Delhi and then from Chennai of an LTTE plot to target Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, home minister P. Chidambaram and Karunanidhi.        
	The 2G investigators, apparently based on information found in files from Gaspars office, raided the house of Akilan Ramanathan, a professor in Bharath University. The varsity is owned by Jagathrakshagan, Union minister of state for information and broadcasting and a DMK leader.        
	Another shock for the DMK was the CBI raid on the office of Rathnam, the auditor of Rajathi. The CBI is clearly trying to establish a link between the 2G scam and the Rajathi-Kanimozhi family as Raja was seen as their nominee, said a DMK MP.         
	The raid on Kamaraj, the journalist, is being attributed to a diary reportedly seized from the house of Rajas brother during the first round of raids when the former ministers premises were also searched. Kamaraj, who hails from Rajas hometown of Perambalur, is close to the former minister and doubles as his campaign manager during Lok Sabha elections. His proximity to Raja is well known and if his name was found in that diary, it is no surprise, said a Tamil journalist.         
	Kamaraj, 38, is said to be so close to Karunanidhi that it is said he can walk into the chief ministers house at will. The DMK patriarch had presided over Kamarajs wedding at Perambalur in 1995.        
	After questioning him for six hours, the CBI team took Kamaraj to his bank in Chennai to inspect a locker. His laptop, passport and a few files were taken from his house and he has been asked to appear in the local CBI office when required.        
	Kamarajs name also cropped up as one of the directors of a Mumbai company  Modern Hi Tech  in which Rajas younger brother Arivu and brother-in-law Krishnamurthy are also directors. The CBI is investigating if front companies had been floated to launder the scam money.        
	Kamarajs wife Jayasudha is reported to be associated with Vaishnavi Communications, Radias company. But the employees of Vaishnavis Chennai office said no one by that name worked in their office.        
	The CBI also raided another chartered accountant, Ganapathy Subramaniam, who audits Rajas real estate company Greenhouse Promoters, and the Tiruchy residences of Rajas brother A. Ramachandran and sister Kamala. Subbudu, the Perambalur-based business partner of Rajas business associate Sadik Batcha, was also raided.        
	Only one factor rose above the cacophony of the raids in Chennai today: the silence of Brothers MK (Stalin and Alagiri), the sons of Karunanidhi from his second marriage. The two have been trying to persuade their father to distance himself from their step-sister Kanimozhi and Raja.        
	The CBI raided Radia and Pradip Baijal, the former Trai chairperson, in the 2G spectrum scam during a swoop on 34 premises in Delhi, Noida and Tamil Nadu early today.         
	The agency searched the house and office of two hawala operators, Mahesh Jain and his brother Alok, in central Delhi for their alleged role in transferring the bribe that some people are said to have received in exchange for favouring telecom companies.         
	A team of 10 CBI officers and two Enforcement Directorate officials raided the south Delhi residence of Radia around 7am and questioned her for over 10 hours. The office of Vaishnavi Communications in central Delhi, which Radia heads, was also raided. We asked her about the phone conversations as well, an officer said.        
	As on the first day, the CBI went on record to say incriminating documents were found, perhaps to address Opposition taunts that ridiculed the raids related to the 2G spectrum allocated in 2007.        
	We have found some incriminating documents from all the 34 places, including Radias home and office. Our officers have traced their links to the scam after probing the money trail, said Vineeta Thakur, DIG, CBI.

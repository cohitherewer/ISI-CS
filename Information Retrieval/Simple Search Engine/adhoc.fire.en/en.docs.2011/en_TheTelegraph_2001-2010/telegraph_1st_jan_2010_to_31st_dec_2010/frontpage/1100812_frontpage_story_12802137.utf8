  - Heritage site faces funds crunch           BIJOY KR SHARMA                                          
	Dhubri, Aug. 11: Constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards, as may be appropriate, shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote the culture, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.         
	The Assam Accord will be 25 years old on Sunday, but the commitments and promises which were enshrined in it in respect of preserving and protecting the heritage sites of Assamese culture, have not been kept.         
	Ramraikuti Satra at Satrasal, a stones throw from the Bangladesh border in Dhubri district, is one such living example of neglect and apathy of the government. Ask its satradhikar, Jitendra Nath Prodhani.         
	Renovation and development in and around the Sri Sri Dham Ramraikuti Satra has not been possible since long because of a lack of funds, he says.         
	A magnificent brass rath (chariot) donated by Maharaja Naranarayan of Koch dynasty of Cooch Behar cries out for scientific preservation. Where is the money for its preservation? laments Prodhani. The accord was fine, but its benefits have not percolated down here, he says.         
	It was at Satrasal that Koch general Bir Chilarai married Bhubaneshwari, daughter of Ramrai, a cousin of Sankardev.         
	Sankardev established this satra in the 16th century here to promote and propagate the Sattriya culture in this region.         
	Chilarai donated three villages in memory of his father-in-law Ramrai for establishing the satra, but a major part of the three villages was acquired by zamindars. Later, the Gouiripur zamindar, Bul Chand Barua, returned 1,429 bighas of land to the satra.         
	On February 19, 1959, the state government acquired 1,267 bighas of land under the Land Ceiling Act against which it has since been paying a levy of Rs 4,365 per month to the satra.         
	In 1989, of the remaining 162 bighas of the satra, the government allotted it only 30 bighas as the rest of it was encroached upon by locals. There are many cases pending in courts in this regard.         
	Prodhani regretted that many a satra in Assam had received financial assistance from the government, but the one established by none other than the saint himself has received scanty help.        
	It is becoming difficult by the day to meet the rising expenditure of the satra. In fact, we run on a deficit, earning Rs 10,000 a month against expenses of Rs 12,000, he said.         
	There are two sources of income  Rs 4,900 from Doordarshan Kendra as rent and Rs 4,365 as levy from the state government.         
	There are numerous sachi patra (manuscripts), books and other items, including the akhaybanti, the earthen lamp lit by Sankardev, which has been burning bright since. The room where the akhaybanti is housed deserves better maintenance.         
	We have petitioned the government from time to time but have not been able to move them to come forward and help, Prodhani said.

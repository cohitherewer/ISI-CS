          CITHARA PAUL                                    (From top) Mamata Banerjee, Sitaram Yechury and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee				                                 
	New Delhi, May 5: This could be their Shesher Kobita before the big battle.        
	Rabindranath Tagore has ensured what no one thought could ever have been possible  Mamata Banerjee and Sitaram Yechury will share the same table.        
	Not to lock in furious debate, as they do in Parliament, but to discuss.        
	The Trinamul Congress leader and the CPM veteran, bitter political enemies, are part of a panel set up by the Union culture ministry to frame guidelines to commemorate Tagores 150th birth anniversary next May.        
	Yechurys party comrade and Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is also part of the 35-member panel headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and which also includes Nobel laureate Amartya Sen.        
	Frankly, we were hesitant initially to have Mamata Banerjee, Yechury and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as a team as they are not known to have a very good relationship. We were dissuaded by many who warned that none of them would accept the invitation to be part of the team. But we decided to give it a try and they all luckily agreed, said an official with the culture ministry.        
	If Bhattacharjee is the man Mamata is aiming to topple next year  around the same time the centenary celebrations are going to be held  there is no love lost between Yechury and the Trinamul leader either.        
	Mamata had refused to extend the term of Yechurys sister-in-law Ragini Yechury, who was an executive director with the railway ministry, although the Railway Board had cleared the extension.        
	Sources said the move to transfer Ragini to South Eastern Railway was a direct fallout of her Yechury link.        
	Mamata and Yechury had also recently clashed in Parliament over the bifurcation of Eastern Railway.        
	But for Tagore, the three would never have shared a table, the culture ministry official said.         
	The source said the presence of the three leaders on the panel was inevitable, though one of them was a bit hesitant initially. But since that person is a great fan of Tagore, it did not take much effort to convince, the official added.        
	The ministry source then explained why the three couldnt be left out of the panel. Yechury is part of the team on two grounds  as a political representative of the ruling party in Bengal and also as the head of the parliamentary panel on culture; Mamata is on the panel as the only cabinet minister from Bengal, and Bhattacharjee is the chief minister of the state. It was improbable to avoid any one of them.        
	The other members on the committee include outgoing Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni and culture secretary Jawhar Sircar.         
	The chief ministers of Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Orissa, Assam, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are also part of the committee along with the heads of Visva-Bharati University, Rabindra Bharati University, Sahitya Akademi, Lalit Kala Akademi and Sangeet Natak Akademi.

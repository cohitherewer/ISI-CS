                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Survivors trial, away from Sohrab case glare
  - Kausars father seeks court-ordered compensation cash from her brother-in-law           RASHEED KIDWAI                            Anwar Rasheed                                        
	Bhopal, Aug. 4: Kausar Bis father wants justice  from the family of Sohrabuddin, her second husband.        
	Poet Anwar Rasheed Ajnabi, who lives in a Bhopal slum, says he wants a pro bono civil rights lawyer to help him recover Rs 10 lakh, given as compensation by the Gujarat government, from Sohrabuddins younger brother Rubabuddin.        
	The Supreme Court had last year ordered the Narendra Modi government to pay an interim ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh each to the families of the couple allegedly murdered by Gujarat police. The bench of Justices Tarun Chatterjee and Aftab Alam asked Gujarat to deposit the amount in court within a week in September 2009.        
	After Rubabuddin Sheikh, the younger brother of Sohrabuddin, insisted, we opened an account in the State Bank of Indore, Patni Bazaar branch, in Ujjain district. We have never used the pass book, Anwar said, sitting in his stone-and-mud house. The pass book is now with Rubabuddin and we do not know what he has done with the money.        
	Anwar said Rubabuddin had got him to sign some papers and he suspects that Sohrabuddins brother, who is fighting the fake encounter case in the Supreme Court, has control over the cash. He has never allowed me to do any transactions. I only have a photocopy of the account but I do not know if it still has the compensation money.        
	Anwar had gone to Ujjain recently and met Sohrabuddins family, but did not get a satisfactory response. Lucknow-based Islamic scholar Naim-ur-Rahman Siddiqui said that according to the Shariat, the money given as compensation for Kausar Bis death should have gone to her father. The husbands family has no claim over it. The compensation money is not inherited wealth, so it should go to her father or children.        
	Kausar Bi, or Shahnaz as she was known before her marriage to small-time criminal Sohrabuddin in 2002, had three children  Ranu, Arif and Imran  from her first marriage to factory worker Basharat. Anwar said the eldest of his three daughters used to observe strict purdah.                  Kausar Bi      
	Her stepmother Shamim Bano recalled that after the birth of Imran, Shahnaz opted for sterilisation as the family had little money. She had to leave her children to secure divorce. It was not her fault, Shamim said.        
	At that time, though, the family was upset with Shahnaz for walking out of her marriage.        
	In 1999, Basharat lost his job as helper with Grasim Industries in Nagda, near Ujjain, and opened a grocery in Khandar Mohalla, Ujjain.        
	After three years of hardship and domestic discord, Shahnaz, who was then in her late thirties, decided to break free. Anwar said his daughter, who had received no formal education, was a dreamer and believed she was destined to be famous.        
	She divorced Basharat and married Sohrabuddin, who was younger than her and whose family was well known in Ujjain. A small-time criminal and police informer who had worked as the driver of D-Company gangster Abdul Latif in Ahmedabad, Sohrabuddin had some money and clout.        
	Basharat is still bitter about being dumped. He said he was not surprised at the kind of end Kausar Bi met and claimed the children did not miss her either.        
	It was difficult for him to sympathise with Kausar Bi after what he went through, Basharat said. For four years, I raised my young children and then got married to Rasheeda, he said.        
	Kausar Bi had allegedly been given the chance to flee when policemen cornered Sohrabuddin, but she chose to stay, and got killed because she was a witness to her husbands death. Her body was burnt and the remains dumped in the Narmada.        
	Shamim said that after Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bis disappearance in November 2005, Anwar searched for his daughter everywhere. There isnt a single dargah in Malwa or Madhya Bharat that he didnt visit to pray for her safety. Then these TV channels dashed our hopes. He stopped watching TV or reading newspapers for months, she said.        
	Sitting in the bare house in Sanjay Colony slum, Shamim says Shahnaz became the inspiration for much of Anwars poetry, now compiled as a book, Anwar-e-Sukhan (Taste of Anwar).        
	Anwar said these days his writing revolves around the pain his daughter suffered.         
	The Supreme Court and the overwhelming support from civil society has helped him repose faith in humanity, Anwar said. I now want to fight on every front even if it means confronting Rubabuddin, he said.

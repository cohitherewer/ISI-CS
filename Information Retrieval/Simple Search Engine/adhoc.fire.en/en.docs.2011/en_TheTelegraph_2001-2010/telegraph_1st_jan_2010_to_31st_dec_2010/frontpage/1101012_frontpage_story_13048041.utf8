The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | ...not what they did in the symbol of new-age India

	Oct. 11: Karnatakas governor today recommended Presidents rule after the BJP won a trust motion by voice vote, but the Congress-led Centre will wait at least till tomorrow when a high court may decide on the controversial disqualification of 16 MLAs who had dumped the government side.        
	Speaker K.G. Bopaiahs move to axe 11 dissident BJP members and five Independents and his decision to have a voice vote had turned a potential marathon into a sprint, helping chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa breast the tape in five minutes flat.        
	But the athletics parallels do not go too far. On a day Indias women discus throwers conjured a new, brighter image for the country at the Commonwealth Games, the Assembly shenanigans in Bangalore, supposed to be the face of modern India, threatened to blight the effort.        
	Opposition legislators attacked marshals and allegedly injured 16 of them; a disqualified Independent tore off his shirt buttons and jumped screaming onto a desk, and the Speaker called police into the House for the first time.        
	By afternoon, a constitutional crisis had taken shape. The axed 16 moved Karnataka High Court and governor H.R. Bharadwaj, who had yesterday advised Bopaiah not to disqualify the MLAs, recommended that the Centre sack the state government over the unconstitutional happenings and farce in the House.        
	The Congress core committee met this evening at the Prime Ministers residence but decided not to act in haste though the party is sceptical of the disqualifications and the move to decide the trust motion by a voice vote.        
	Sources said the cabinet would take a decision only after the legality of the disqualifications is decided by the high court, which has adjourned hearing till tomorrow. The Congress remembers how Supreme Court rulings had gone against the previous UPA government following similar crises in Bihar and Jharkhand.        
	The cabinet is expected to meet in the afternoon tomorrow, when the BJP intends to march all its MLAs before President Pratibha Patil in Delhi.        
	Party sources said the Congress leadership was unanimous that there would be no attempts at a coalition with the Janata Dal (Secular) in Karnataka. The core committee meeting, attended by Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, Pranab Mukherjee, P. Chidambaram and Ahmed Patel, felt any such alliance in these murky circumstances would hurt the Congress.        
	The political feedback the Congress has received is that imposition of Presidents rule will not generate sympathy for the BJP, which has lost its goodwill among the people. Many leaders feel early elections are the best option but the high command may prefer a spell of Presidents rule.        
	The Speaker violated all legislative and democratic norms by disqualifying the MLAs without giving them a proper hearing, and the trust vote was won by sheer goondagardi (muscle power), Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said. Other party leaders said the victory by voice vote had no sanctity.        
	The 16 MLAs who were disqualified had last week expressed their lack of confidence in Yeddyurappas leadership in a letter to the governor. Their disqualification gave the government the numbers it wanted  only just  and it appears the BJP did not want to risk a division of votes. (See chart)        
	The Opposition said the Speaker had exceeded his powers by disqualifying the MLAs even before they had voted in the Assembly, but the Supreme Court had in 2007 ruled that the anti-defection law kicked in the moment a member expressed his intent to go against his parent party.         
	In the high court, the Karnataka government is represented by former attorney-general Soli Sorabjee while senior counsel P.P. Rao argued for the petitioners.        
	Some legal experts said that if the court stayed the Speakers order, the governor would have the option of directing Yeddyurappa to seek another vote.        
	The CPM, while accusing the Karnataka government of brazen constitutional impropriety, appeared to suggest it should now try and establish its majority through a division of votes. The CPI asked for dismissal of the government.

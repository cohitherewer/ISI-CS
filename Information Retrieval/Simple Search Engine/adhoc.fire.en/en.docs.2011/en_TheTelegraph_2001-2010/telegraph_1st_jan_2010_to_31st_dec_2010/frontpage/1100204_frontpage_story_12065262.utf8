The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sensor in belly: Time for your pill
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Sensor in belly: Time for your pill
          OUR BUREAU                      The ingestible event marker                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: A pill containing medicine and a tiny digestible sensor made from food ingredients and capable of transmitting wireless messages like a cellphone may soon help remind patients about missed drug doses.         
	Proteus Biomedical, a California-based company pursuing intelligent health products, has developed ingestible event markers (IEM)  tiny, digestible sensors activated by stomach fluids after they are swallowed.         
	The company says the IEM, when activated, sends an ultra-low power, digital signal through the body to a microelectronic receiver that can be placed as a small bandage-like patch on the skin to record the date, time, drug and the dose consumed.         
	A PTI report from Washington said the device was expected to improve patients adherence to drugs, particularly during chronic conditions when patients are more likely to forget to take doses at the right time.         
	The sensor is currently undergoing clinical trials and is expected to be available for sale by late 2011, PTI quoted Andrew Thompson, the chief executive officer of Proteus, as saying.         
	The World Health Organisation estimates that patients adherence to drug schedules is only about 50 per cent among people with chronic illnesses in developed countries. The figure is expected to be even lower in developing countries.         
	The sensor (in the device) is made up of food and vitamin materials in very small and safe quantities, Thompson said. The patch can also record data about heart rate, body temperature, and send it to Proteus via a phone.         
	The pill is currently on trial for heart diseases, high blood pressure and tuberculosis.         
	The IEM is manufactured on silicon wafers and is extremely economical to produce, Proteus said on its website, describing what it calls ingestible technology. The device is likely to cost only a few cents for every sensor when manufactured in large numbers.         
	Healthcare analysts believe lack of patients adherence to drug schedules not only threatens the well-being of patients, but also increases medical costs that result from the consequences of missing doses.         
	The drug company Novartis AG recently invested $24 million in Proteus to secure licences for the companys drug-delivery technologies.

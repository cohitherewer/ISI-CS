The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | First iPad autograph by Obama
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                First iPad autograph by Obama

	Miami, Oct. 23: President Barack Obama has given his first ever iPad autograph  to a fan named Sylvester Cann  after he previously denounced the device as a distraction.        
	 Obama, who once said he had no clue how to work an iPad, seemed to have brushed up on his technological knowhow when a fan thrust one at him during a political rally and asked for his autograph.        
	While others in the crowd settled for a pen and paper, or just a simple handshake, Sylvester Cann held out his computer tablet bearing a handwritten message that he created using the Adobe Ideas app, a programme that allows the user to doodle on the screen. Mr President, sign my iPad, it demanded.        
	 A scowling bodyguard shook his head at Cann and told him No. But the President smiled and stepped closer, touching his fingertip to the screen and scrawling his signature obligingly.        
	Secret Service was leery about the idea, but they got over it and the President thought it was cool, explained Cann, 30, who is a legislative aide to Democratic state congressman Scott White, and a self-described big technology guy. This has to be the first time an iPad has received a presidential autograph, he added.        
	Obamas technological breakthrough moment came a day after he met the iPads creator, Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple.        
	Yet in May, the President bemoaned iPads and other computer gadgetry during a critique of modern media, telling students at Hampton University in Virginia: With iPods and iPads and Xboxes and PlayStations  none of which I know how to work  information becomes a distraction, a diversion, a form of entertainment, rather than a tool of empowerment.        
	Yesterday in Los Angeles, Obama branded Republicans as radical, in campaign appearances for Democratic senators under threat in Novembers mid-term polls. He charged that the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, will not be able to win the Opposition partys presidential nomination.

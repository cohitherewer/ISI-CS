  - Kamrup lad tops High Madrassa, Barpeta boy shines in HSLC exam          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Guwahati, May 29: Assam today produced its best ever results in a matriculation (Class X) exam with the overall pass percentage touching an all-time high of 63.21 per cent.         
	The results of this years High School Leaving Certificate examination, conducted by the Board of Secondary Education, Assam (SEBA), set the record of the highest-ever pass percentage with 1,71,276 out the 2,70,930 candidates clearing the exam.         
	This years pass percentage was 1.66 per cent higher than last years 61.55.         
	A total of 19, 034 students passed the exam in first division and 31,720 in second division, while 1,20,522 students were placed in third division.        
	SEBA secretary Dhanadev Mahanta gave credit for the best-ever results to a growing awareness among parents and students about education and the need to do well in examinations for a better future.         
	Another highlight of the result was the high aggregate marks secured by individual candidates. Many candidates scored full marks even in social science. Such a development will help students from the state to compete with their counterparts in the rest of the country. Introduction of objective type questions by SEBA also helped students to score more marks, Mahanta said.         
	He said the SEBA was preparing its syllabi in Classes IX and X on the lines of NCERT to enable students to rub shoulders with their counterparts in CBSE-affiliated schools. The board was implementing various measures, including adoption of a liberal attitude in evaluating answer scripts, to enable students to score more marks, he added.        
	There has been a debate that unlike the CBSE, the SEBA evaluators adopt a conservative attitude, for which students from Assam score lesser marks than their counterparts in the central board.         
	We cannot follow the CBSE fully in allotting marks. SEBA believes that education is not all about scoring high marks in exams, Mahanta added.         
	This year, boys fared better than girls, with 66.7 per cent clearing the exam against 59.72 per cent by the latter.         
	Among the districts, Nalbari topped the list with a pass percentage of 79.7, followed by Dhemaji with 78.19 per cent and Barpeta with 73.89 per cent. Hailakandi was at the bottom of the list with 38.04 per cent.         
	Altogether 156 students shared the top 20 positions in the merit list, led by Jugal Talukdar of Sankardev Sishu Niketan, Choukhuty, at Barbang in Barpeta district.         
	I studied to gain knowledge and it is just a coincidence that I topped the list. Initially, I will take admission in the science stream. I will decide on my future career in consultation with my parents later, an elated Jugal told The Telegraph from Barbang. Himangshu Bhuyan of BVFC Model High School at Namrup in Dibrugarh district clinched the second position in the merit list.         
	The third position was shared by Nabaneeroj Saikia of Don Bosco High School, Tezpur, Spondon Jyoti Goswami of Modern High School, Guwahati, and Dhrubajyoti Choudhury of Assam Jatiya Bidyalay, Guwahati.         
	In the Assam High Madrassa exam this year, a total of 4,929 candidates out of 6,708 came out successful. While 139 candidates secured the first division, 978 and 3812 students were placed in the second and third divisions respectively. Aminul Islam from SAB High Madrassa, Rowmari in Kamrup district was the topper with an aggregate of 85 per cent.         
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi congratulated all the successful candidates.

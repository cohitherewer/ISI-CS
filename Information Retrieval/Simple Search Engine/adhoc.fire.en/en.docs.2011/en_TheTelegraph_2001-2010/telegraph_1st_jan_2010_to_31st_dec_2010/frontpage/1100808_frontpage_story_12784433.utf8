The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | JPL put off over rain fears
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                JPL put off over rain fears
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jamshedpur, Aug. 7: The possibility of rains in September has cast a cloud on the Jharkhand Premier League (JPL).        
	Planned with a lot of promise and scheduled in Dhanbad from September 24 to 30, Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA)s answer to IPL will now have to be postponed.        
	JPL convenor SA Rehman told The Telegraph over telephone from Dhanbad that September did not seem to be a viable month for holding the T-20 tournament.         
	It generally rains during September and October. And the delayed monsoon is certainly a contributing factor. In fact, rain played spoilsport in October last year when the match between zonal champions and rest of Jharkhand was washed out in Dhanbad.         
	JSCA secretary Rajesh Verma confirmed the JPLs decision. He said the JPL governing council had decided to postpone the T-20 tournament keeping in mind the possibility of rains during September, adding that fresh dates would be announced later.        
	 This means, the schedule of various pre-tournament formalities would also be revised. JPL would soon notify new dates for team bidding and players auction on its website. The bid documents will continue to be on sale though, Verma added.        
	 It is likely that a jam-packed domestic cricket schedule in the coming months could push the JPL to next year.        
	 The JPl doesnt seem possible because of the tight schedule of domestic tournaments organised by the BCCI. It could well be organised in February-March next year, a JSCA official admitted.        
	Also, since money was involved in the tournament, it would not be a wise idea to disturb it due to rains.        
	 Five district teams -- Dhanbad Diamonds, Ranchi Rangers, Jamshedpur Janbaz, Singhbhum Sher and Bokaro Balwan _ were to compete in the JPL planned by the JSCA in collaboration with Elire Sports Management.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Crop insurance clean-up saves crores
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Crop insurance clean-up saves crores
          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 7: Meticulous verification has saved the state exchequer around Rs 40 crore by way of farmers crop insurance claims, reducing the number of beneficiaries by as much as 3 lakh and exposing several systemic lacunae that were being routinely exploited by fraudsters.        
	The 2009 kharif season crop insurance claims, to be settled before the onset of monsoon this year, was held up after the state co-operative department received several complaints in August.         
	Now, after a thorough verification at the district level, the number of claimants has come down to 10 lakh farmers. Therefore, the states share of their payout will be around Rs 98 crore against an earlier estimate of Rs 138 crore.        
	The reduction in the amount is the result of a thorough verification of individual claims. The number of eligible claimants has come down to less than 10 lakh against the earlier 13 lakh, registrar (co-operative societies) Rajesh Kumar Sharma said.         
	There are two categories of farmers with crop insurance. One who had also availed of agricultural loans from co-operative banks and the other who did not. There are no accounting problems for the first category. The irregularities concern the second category, that is, non-loanee farmers.         
	According to sources, in a majority of cases a single farm plot was insured twice by using fake names and receipts of land revenue payments. Also, several non-agricultural plots were insured without prior verification. Now the co-operative department, the nodal agency handling crop insurance, will have to issue a fresh declaration on the number of beneficiaries for Agriculture Insurance Company of India Limited (AIC) for starting payouts.        
	Claim payments, to be made jointly by the state government, AIC and the Union agriculture ministry, will then be credited to individual non-loanee farmers with accounts in co-operative credit banks known as LAMPS (Large area multi-purpose societies) and PACS (Prime agricultural credit societies) in rural areas.        
	Anupam Das, regional manager of AIC, said they were yet to receive a fresh declaration on the actual number of beneficiaries.

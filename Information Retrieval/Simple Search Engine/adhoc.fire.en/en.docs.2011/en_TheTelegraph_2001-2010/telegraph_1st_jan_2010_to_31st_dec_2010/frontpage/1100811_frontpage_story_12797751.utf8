	Ahmedabad, Aug. 10: Police informer to Bollywood producer, Zahir Raja has made a swift switch.        
	Raja, 38, was until April an informer for Gujarat crime branch chief Abhay Chudasama. Then Chudasama was arrested in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case, and he decided it was time for a fresh start.        
	I want to forget my past, said Raja, sitting in his new office on the banks of the Sabarmati. He launched his film production company Framework Productions last month, and claims his first project has a Bollywood star son in the lead.        
	The budget for the film, titled Kashmakash, is Rs 30 crore, all of which Raja said he would stump up himself with no need for a financier.        
	Raja, like Mehboob Senior, Yusuf Barafwala, Javed Hero, Iqbal Patel and several others, was part of a breed of police informers cultivated by the crime branch and the anti-terrorism squad who turned crorepatis after the 2002 riots.        
	They would tip off officers like Chudasama or ATS chief D.G. Vanzara, also behind bars in the Sohrabuddin case. In return, they would get paid and be allowed to carry on their often illegal businesses under police protection.        
	After the riots, in which hundreds of Muslims were killed, fear gripped the community and many bought weapons for their own protection, often illegally. The informers  all of whom, except Tulsi Prajapati, were Muslims  would get wind of the purchases and inform their police bosses.        
	Then deals were struck: anyone possessing a countrymade weapon was let off after paying Rs 50,000; for automatic weapons, the price went up to Rs 5 lakh.                    
	The informers, most of them also criminals, would do the dirty work for the policemen: arranging meetings, negotiating the price and collecting the money.        
	This was a big source of income for the police as well as their informers, apart from a regular extortion racket, sources said.        
	Sohrabuddin, who was killed in a fake encounter in 2005, was also a police informer. Sources in the CBI investigating his death said Sohrabuddin and Chudasama would have a 25:75 share in extortion money.        
	Raja is believed to have been paid Rs 10,000 by Chudasama on each visit. He used to treat me as his younger brother, recalled Raja, who became a police informer by dint of his link with D-Company gangster Rasool Khan who had fled to Pakistan. Raja had promised to turn in brother-in-law Rasool if he ever returned to India.        
	B.J. Gadhvi, a retired DIG, said a police officer was supposed to cultivate sources and pay them from a secret account meant for undercover work . Apart from regular sources, officers can have their own informers who are usually criminals. The problem arises only when the officers use the informers to run an extortion racket, such as Vanzara and Chudasama allegedly did.        
	The informers who would strut around dropping names  Javed Hero, who worked for the ATS chief even called himself Vanzara, while Iqbal Patel said he was Chudasama  are lying low, some having even gone into hiding. Raja, though, is seeking out the limelight. Im busy giving final touches to my film project, he said, introducing his films director, Rajendra Dutt, who he claimed was a National School of Drama alumnus. It is a much better business, more lucrative than land brokerage and bootlegging.

          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 11: The morning will show the day for My Name is Khan.        
	The Shah Rukh Khan-starrer will release as scheduled tomorrow but multiplexes and standalone theatres in Mumbai were not willing to commit till late tonight if they would screen the film in the city and some parts of Maharashtra.         
	Plex owners had been keen that the superstar apologise to the Shiv Sena and end the stand-off over the actors comments on Pakistani cricketers, but Shah Rukh refused to relent. The star, in Berlin for the films European premiere, spent much of the day posting messages on Twitter.        
	In a late-evening statement, distributors Fox STAR said the film would release across India tomorrow, but refused specifics when asked about the Mumbai opening.         
	There is a huge demand for My Name is Khan. We are releasing it nationally tomorrow, Fox STAR CEO Vijay Singh said in the statement.        
	But exhibitors in Mumbai said they would wait till the law and order situation improved. After deciding to hold back screening in Mumbai through the day, the exhibitors  both plexes and single-screen theatres  agreed on a middle-path later in the evening.        
	We have decided to cancel the morning shows on Friday as of now, though all of us are prepared for an indefinite postponement of screening. We are here to run our business. We will not take any undue risks, said a top official of a multiplex chain.        
	The final call is expected after a meeting between Fox STAR, exhibitors and officials of producer Karan Johars Dharma Productions.        
	Even single-screen theatres like Maratha Mandir, where the Shah Rukh-Kajol starrer Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is into its 15th year, have decided against opening bookings.         
	Theatres like Suburbia and Globus in Bandra too are wary since they are within malls, whose managements do not want their other outlets to be affected by the protests. The only theatre that has gone ahead with bookings is City Lights in Mahim.        
	The decision to wait till tomorrow came after a day of hectic parleys between government representatives and the filmmakers, distributors and exhibitors.         
	The most crucial was a conference call between Shah Rukh and Johar and exhibitors assembled at the Dharma Productions office in Mumbai.        
	Shah Rukh, the sources said, made an emotional appeal, but the exhibitors said they had to take a cold business call as they did not want to be at the Senas receiving end.        
	The exhibitors wanted Shah Rukh to mend fences with the Sena and seek conciliation. He was even ready for that, but some Congress leaders advised him against it and he backed off, an exhibitor claimed.        
	Congress sources confirmed that a senior Union minister from Maharashtra, close to Shah Rukh, called the actor and advised him strongly not to apologise to the Sena as it would leave the party red-faced.        
	Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan was irked when reporters had earlier in the day told him the star had been keen on visiting Sena boss Bal Thackeray. I cant stop anybody from visiting anybody. I do not care about any film or any actor  as the head of the state I only care about law and order and governance which means not giving legitimacy to a bunch of mobsters. That is the reason I have taken these security steps, Chavan said.        
	Multiplex sources said the Sena threats notwithstanding, some old unresolved scores between Shah Rukh and the plex owners also came in the way. Producers and multiplex owners were once locked in a stand-off and some exhibitors had felt that Shah Rukh was supporting the other side.        
	Others blamed the poor response to advance bookings for stepping back with the release. Advance bookings are pegged at a meagre 10 per cent from Monday, when the windows opened, till Thursday evening. There are certainly reasons behind that, but who would want to expose themselves to Sena mobs for the sake of such low business volumes, said Vishal Kapoor, chief operating officer of Fun Cinemas, a multiplex chain.        
	The plex owners have also been worried about unconfirmed reports of Sena activists buying large chunks of the advance tickets to create ruckus inside the theatres during screening.         
	The Sena announced victory following the theatre owners decision to hold back screening for the time being.        
	Shah Rukh, who has received a lot of support from Netizens and the tweeple (Twitter users), found backing from writer Javed Akhtar, who termed the protests unfortunate. It was most unfortunate as the film star had not said anything for which so much of hue and cry can be raised, Akhtar said in Indore.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: The Union cabinet today approved a bill to make it mandatory for clinical establishments, including hospitals, diagnostic centres and nursing homes, to register themselves and conform to minimum quality standards.         
	The Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Bill is also expected to provide the legislative framework to introduce a system of classification of clinical establishments, depending on their location and the services they offer. NGOs and public health activists have been demanding such legislation since the mid-1990s.         
	The health ministry has said the law  if it is enacted by Parliament  will come into effect in Union territories, and states are expected to adopt the legislation.         
	The ministry has conceded that while some state legislatures have enacted laws, the existing regulatory regime has been unable to ensure health services that are of acceptable quality. Bengal has a registration system but that has not led to significant improvement in services.        
	In principle, this bill could lead to a system where hospitals might be classified according to the services they provide, said Amar Jesani of the Centre for Studies on Ethics and Rights in Mumbai. The classification system could be compared to the way restaurants may be graded as 1 or 2 or 3, depending on services provided.

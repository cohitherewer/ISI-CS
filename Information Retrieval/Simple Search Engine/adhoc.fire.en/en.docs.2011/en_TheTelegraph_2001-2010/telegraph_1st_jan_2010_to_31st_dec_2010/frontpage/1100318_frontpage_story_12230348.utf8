The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bid to pre-empt Bangla envoy 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bid to pre-empt Bangla envoy 
  - Bengal appeal against author         CITHARA PAUL                            Hasina                                        
	New Delhi, March 17: A group of Muslim leaders from Bengal has written to the Bangladesh Prime Minister requesting her not to send as Dhakas deputy high commissioner in Calcutta a writer they claim has insulted the Prophet and made false allegations of atrocities against Hindus.        
	The letter says Salam Azad, said to have been shortlisted as a possible candidate for the post, is known for his blasphemous writings and his appointment will be against the public interest and the interest of Bangladesh.        
	He (Azad) in his numerous writings has brought several blasphemous charges against the saviour of humanity. Being Muslims, these views are totally unacceptable. Vanga Matt, Salam Azads book published from Calcutta, is full of false accusations, slander and defamation against the Holy Prophet of Islam, the letter says.        
	The signatories to the letter include Usman Ghani, former head of the department (Islamic History) of Calcutta University, Abdur Rauf, editor of literary journal Chaturanga, and five others, including a prominent cleric.        
	Although the letter does not mention Taslima Nasreen, the leaders fear that Azad could end up being a male version of the controversial Bangladeshi writer. Last month, violence had erupted in Karnataka after the Kannada translation of an article purportedly written by Taslima was published in some local dailies. She later denied having penned any article for a paper in Karnataka and dubbed the unrest an attempt to malign her.        
	The Muslim leaders have accepted in their letter that officially they have no say in who Dhaka picks, but voiced fears that Azads appointment could hurt bilateral relations, which have improved in Hasinas tenure.        
	Bangladesh is a sovereign country, and we being citizen of a different country have no say in its matter of recruitment of able candidates for any governmental post. However we would like to bring to your kind notice some information regarding Salam Azad, the letter says before reeling off other allegations.        
	The leaders have alleged that Azad in his other books  such as Chukti Uttar Prabatta Chatagram, Shasti Bahini Shanti Chukti, Ethnic Cleansing, Bangladeshe Bippono Sonkha Loghu, Why Hindus Left Bangladesh  claims that the minorities (Hindus) in Bangladesh have gone through unspeakable torture, injustice, ethnic cleansing and execution at the hands of the military and citizens alike. But unbiased sources, the leaders have pointed out in the letter, have clarified the charges of such atrocities are baseless.        
	The letter seeks to remind Hasina of her father, Mujibur Rahman, and the ideals of tolerance he preached. We know your beloved and globally respected father the late Mujibur Rahman was named Banga Bandhu, or friend of Bengal. Like him you have high regard for communal tolerance and peaceful coexistence.        
	The letter concludes by urging the Prime Minister Hasina to kindly reconsider the appointment and take appropriate measures.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Asian women MPs in Commons for first time
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Asian women MPs in Commons for first time
          AMIT ROY                            Shabana Mahmood (top) and Priti Patel                          
	London, May 7: The new House of Commons will be very different from the last one in one important respect following yesterdays general election  it will have several Asian women MPs when previously there was none.        
	Priti Patel, who won Witham, a new constituency in Essex, can expect to be a high profile member of the Conservative Party. She polled 24,448 votes, trouncing the Lib Dem candidate, Margaret Phelps (9,252) and her Labour opponent, John Spademan (8,656), and taking the seat with a massive majority of 24,448 on a 70.2 per cent turn out.        
	Labour will have three Muslim women MPs  Pakistani-origin Shabana Mahmood, who took Birmingham Ladywood with a majority of 10,105 on a turnout of 48.7 per cent; Rushanara Ali, a Bangladeshi elected for Bethnal Green and Bow with a majority of 11,574 on a turnout of 62.4 per cent; and another Pakistani woman, Yasmin Qureshi, who had a majority of 8634 on a turnout of 56.6 per cent in Bolton South-East.        
	Collectively, they will be more effective in representing Muslim issues in parliament than their male counterparts. (In Glasgow Central, Britains first Muslim MP, Pakistani-origin Mohammed Sarwar, was yesterday succeeded by his son, Anas, who got in with a majority of 10,551 on a turnout of 50.9 per cent.)        
	Yasmin said she believed she was the first Muslim female to be elected an MP in the UK, but that was before the other successes of the night.        
	 Im absolutely delighted, commented Yasmin. Obviously, I am very pleased the voters of Bolton South East chose a Labour candidate and elected a Labour MP. It is a truly humbling experience and I promise to work very hard for the constituents.                  
	There was success for Valerie Vaz who won Walsall South for Labour in the West Midlands. She comes from a Goan Catholic family.        
	Valerie got 16,211 votes and had a narrow majority of 1,755 on a turnout of 63.1 per cent. But she has the chance now to build up a personal following and make the seat safer, as her brother has done since he was first elected in 1987.        
	Keith Vaz, who was reelected in the safe Labour seat of Leicester East, expressed his happiness. He pointed out that he and Valerie will be the first brother and sister to sit in the House of Commons at the same time.        
	He added: I am delighted that Valerie has been elected, she will make an excellent MP and I look forward to debating in the Commons together.        
	Among the Indian men, there is a new face  Alok Sharma, who took Reading West for the Tories from Labour. His father, Prem Sharma, has been a Tory stalwart for years.        
	Alok, who received 20,523 votes and got in with a majority of 6,004 on a turnout of 65.9 per cent, said he was delighted with the result and would be heading off home to have breakfast with his wife and two children before sitting down with his staff to discuss their next move. We are going to sit down and identify the issues in Reading West and start working on those.        
	However, there was a shock for Parmjit Gill, the Lib Dem candidate in Leicester South who failed to take the seat from the sitting Labour MP, Peter Soulsby, despite high hopes that he would do so.        
	Soulsby surprisingly managed to increase the Labour vote by 6.2 per cent, against the national trend, to 21,479, while Parmjit got 12,671 votes, a reduction of 3.7 per cent compared with the last election.

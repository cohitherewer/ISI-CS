                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                State yet to act on Games audit report 
  - PAG detected several instances of financial bungling          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                                     
	Ranchi, Aug. 12: Heads may have begun to roll as misdeeds of members of the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee are exposed one by one in Delhi, closer home, the principal accountant generals (PAG) report on large-scale bungling in affairs of the 34th National Games appears to have been pushed under the carpet.        
	The audit was carried out by the PAGs office on the directions of former Governor Syed Sibtey Razi between April 1, 2008, and December 7, 2009, after allegations of financial irregularities poured in against the National Games Organising Committee (NGOC).        
	In fact, Raj Bhavan, during the first spell of Presidents rule, had ordered a vigilance probe against the then sports director, P.C. Mishra, in November 2009, following allegations of financial impropriety. Mishra also happened to be the director of NGOC.        
	Vigilance DSP Madhusudan Bari was made the investigating officer. In the last week of March, Bari was handed over the PAG report to expand the scope of investigation.        
	We are verifying the documents and have also sought further information from the NGOC. We will be able to make a case in a fortnight or so, Bari told The Telegraph today.        
	Inspector-general (vigilance) M.V. Rao, however, admitted that there had not been much headway in the investigations. I have suggested some measures to the DGP to speed up matters, he said, refusing to elaborate.        
	Governors adviser V.S. Dubey, in the meantime, told The Telegraph that he had called for the file concerned. We will be able to take further action only after examining the available documents, Dubey, also in-charge of the vigilance department, said.        
	PAG had detected gross anomalies in awarding tenders for purchasing sports goods, allotting caterers, transporting sportspersons and officials, engaging volunteers, housekeeping and allotting event management jobs.         
	Incidentally, the PAG scope of investigation was confined to purchase of sports goods and tenders awarded for other allied services. It did not pertain to construction of infrastructure for the Games.         
	As of now, over Rs 700 crore worth of infrastructure is ready. It comprises nine stadiums, a sports hostel and around 1,200 flats at the Mega Sports Complex. Besides, the renovated Birsa Munda Stadium and the astroturf hockey stadium, both at Morabadi, and squash and handball courts in Dhanbad are also ready.        
	The 34th National Games, originally scheduled for November 2007, has already been postponed five times, and is now tentatively scheduled for December.        
	The PAG had also objected to payment of Rs 50 lakh to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) as royalty for postponement of the 34th National Games.        
	Though the NGOC justified the payment on the grounds of a provision in the Host City contract signed by the state with IOA, the PAG report said the NGOC was required to establish the amount of damage caused due to default by the organising committee.         
	NGOC should have similarly asked the IOA to prove the damage caused to it due to deferment of the Games, the report said.        
	The audit also detected gross anomalies in awarding the tender for providing vehicles for transportation of sportspersons and officials and pointed to excess payments to the tune of Rs 3.47 crore.        
	Significantly, the NGOC office-bearers have consistently dismissed the PAG report as inconsequential and one that dwells on procedural technicalities, even justifying cost escalations as the price to ensure quality.        
	In fact, a high-level committee headed by Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay was constituted by the IOA in order to resolve the issue between the state and NGOC after the PAG report.         
	NGOC organising secretary S.M. Hashmi said the Games had to be held according to the terms and conditions of the Host City contract and keystone of the contract was autonomy for NGOC.        
	We have prepared the replies to the objections raised by PAG. We hope Raj Bhavan will send it to PAG soon, he told The Telegraph from New Delhi.

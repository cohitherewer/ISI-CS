          OUR BUREAU                              
	Dec. 29: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee waited a day to reply to P. Chidambarams letter so that he could get the content and tenor approved by his Delhi comrades, party sources said today.        
	The chief ministers personal contribution to the content of the missive, sent yesterday and released to the media today, seems to be the attack on the home ministers use of the nasty word harmad to describe CPM cadres.        
	Apart from that, the letter virtually reads like the recent statements from the state CPM and the politburo, questioning the leak of Chidambarams letter and its impartiality, blaming the Bengal violence on a Trinamul-Maoist nexus, and citing the sacrifices the Marxists have made while fighting it.        
	Bhattacharjee could have sent his reply on Monday itself after receiving Chidambarams letter at 11am. But given the partisan nature of Chidambarams allegations, he decided to discuss the draft with the partys central leadership, a CPM source said.        
	(State party secretary) Biman Bose discussed the content, language and tenor of the reply with Bhattacharjee on Monday evening and also spoke to our West Midnapore district party secretary. He then had a talk with the party leadership in Delhi. Bimanda may have spoken to Karat, the source added.        
	On Tuesday morning, a senior Writers Buildings official was asked to prepare a draft on the lines suggested by the chief minister. It was vetted by Bimanda before being faxed to Chidambaram.        
	Bhattacharjee apparently insisted on framing the last paragraph himself, expressing his objection to the use of harmad, because he wanted to send a stern message to Chidambaram about his language for the second time.        
	In April, Bhattacharjee had advised Chidambaram to mind your language after the home minister had said the buck stops at the chief ministers table while speaking on combating the Maoists.        
	I strongly object to your using the word harmad... without knowing the actual meaning of this nasty word coined by Trinamul Congress leaders, his reply says.        
	If the CPM leadership helped draft the letter, it also got pro-active in distributing it in Delhi today. Copies were handed out to the media from party headquarters A.K. Gopalan Bhavan.         
	Officially, this should have been done by the office of Bengals resident commissioner in Delhi, Bhaskar Khulbe, but he said he had no idea who distributed the copies of the fax. I was not contacted, he said.        
	A CPM leader accepted that the move was unusual but said: Reporters were calling us, seeking copies of the letter. Since it was already in the public domain after the Writers Buildings released it, we accessed a copy and distributed it.

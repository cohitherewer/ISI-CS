	New Delhi, March 11: The government today banned FTV for nine days over the telecast of a clip showing women with nude upper body.        
	The clip, telecast last year, was from a retrospective in Barcelona in 2001 on British fashion designer Alexander McQueen, who was found dead in London last month. It depicted a Roman mythological character.        
	A programme on FTV channel was telecast on 4.9.2009 at 15:37:34 hours and 19:01:48 showing women with nude upper body, which was offending against good taste and decency, the information and broadcasting ministry said.        
	The visuals were found to be obscene, denigrating (towards) women and were not suitable for children and unrestricted public exhibition.        
	The ban, effective from 7pm tomorrow till 7pm on March 21, is the second on FTV. The channel was banned for two months in April-May 2007 on grounds of telecasting programmes such as Midnight Hot wherein skimpily dressed and semi-naked models were shown.        
	The channel has been found to have violated several sections of the Cable Television Network Rules, 1995.        
	In its reply to the ministrys show-cause notice on September 24, FTV had said the clip of the programme was not meant to demean or disgrace women.        
	At later hearings, the channel conceded that telecasting the clip was an inadvertent mistake and promised to revise its internal procedures to ensure conducive programming. It, however, insisted that the clip was not indecent.        
	In a letter on November 6, FTV said: From an aesthetic and imaginative point of a designer, the attire was designed for the model and was not meant to demean or disgrace women.        
	FTV again promised to make its internal procedures more stringent so that the system does not play out a clip that may remotely be considered offensive.        
	On January 27, however, the ministrys inter-ministerial committee  made up by officials from ministries such as those of women amp; child welfare and information amp; broadcasting  asked for action against the channel.        
	The government told the Lok Sabha earlier this week that the channels banned completely were TB6, REN TV, Blue Kiss, Blue Kiss Express, Blue Kiss Promo, TBL XXX and Free X TV. Those banned for specific periods included Cine World, AXN and Janmat TV.        
	The information and broadcasting ministry has issued 310 show-cause notices to private channels in the past six years. There are 537 private TV channels in India  461 uplinked and 76 downlinked  and 32 government-run channels, including Doordarshan and the Parliament channels.

          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Aug. 30: A Rajdhani Expresss engine was derailed, loose Pandrol clips were strewn around and a disaster was just averted in Bengal this morning.        
	A key braking device got unhinged as the Howrah-bound Rajdhani (via Gaya) sped at 125kmph, putting the 500 passengers on the brink of tragedy and raising doubts about the upkeep of the countrys showpiece train.        
	Drivers M.P. Singh and E.P. Toppo saved the day, slamming the emergency brake in the nick of time, or else several bogies could have overturned, railway officials said.        
	The incident took place just outside Baruipara station in Hooghly, about 27km from Howrah. Apparently, a strip (in the braking device) of the locomotive got unhinged, damaged the tracks and caused the derailment, Eastern Railway general manager V.N. Tripathy said.        
	The passengers had to pull down their bags, lug them 50 metres to the station and cover the last leg of their journey on a local train the railways had sent for them.        
	Most passengers felt a massive jerk at 9.25am and some saw smoke billowing from under the engine, which caused them to jump off the train in panic after it stopped.        
	Graphic designing student Nandini Dasgupta, travelling alone for the first time on her way home from her Delhi institute, felt as if her mothers nightmare had almost come true. She had warned me, citing all the recent accidents and terror attacks involving trains. I called my mother as soon as the train stopped, the Tollygunge girl said.        
	Every train wheel has a separate braking unit. Sources said the rod that came unhinged from one of the trains tread-brake units (TBUs) brushed against the rails for over a kilometre and eventually got stuck at a point where two tracks converged.        
	That threatened to throw the engine off the tracks and the drivers, unaware of what had happened, pulled the brakes. But they realised that one of the brakes wasnt working on one of the wheels and the emergency brake was the only option left.        
	There was a huge noise from under the engine. Then there was a jerk and I knew that one of the wheels was getting derailed. So, I slammed the emergency brake, said driver Singh.        
	An official said: Because of the friction caused by the dislocated TBU of the second left wheel, the tracks broke in at least 10 places and over 300 Pandrol clips got torn.        
	At first some railway officials mistook the scattered clips as a sign of sabotage. But experts said the accident was probably a result of poor maintenance.         
	Before every journey, all the components of a train are to be thoroughly checked. Trains cant leave without a safety clearance. But those checks were evidently not run properly, an official said. An engine should also undergo periodic overhauling, he said.        
	A WAP Seven locomotive, the latest in the railways fleet, was pulling the Rajdhani. A senior railway official said the engine belonged to East Central Railway, whose locomotives are looked after by the Gomoh workshop. But it may not be capable of servicing such a sophisticated (6,000 horse power) engine, he said.        
	The Rajdhani had apparently undergone a safety check at Dhanbad but no fault could be detected.         
	A four-member railway committee will start a probe tomorrow, which should tell us if there was a maintenance problem, an official said.        
	The biggest Rajdhani disaster happened in 2002, killing over 130 people when 15 coaches got derailed on a river bridge near Gaya.

  - Sachin speaks out, seeks thorough probe          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      Sachin Tendulkar after being conferred the honorary rank in New Delhi on Friday. (Reuters)                                
	Sept. 3: A fascinating sting operation, players willing to sell their country, a boastful bookie, sleuths burning the midnight oil... an honorary Group Captain  Sachin Tendulkar, no less  voicing the sentiments of millions...        
	It has been an incredible week and, as it draws to a close, we are in the midst of two battles: Pakistan versus England on the field; the Pakistan government, through a diplomat, against the International Cricket Council (ICC) off it.        
	Strangely, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is nowhere in the picture. There is no sign of Ijaz Butt, the PCB chairman, who has pretty thick connections with those running the show in Islamabad.        
	With Ijaz Butt missing, Pakistans high commissioner to the UK, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, has worn the hat of an all-rounder and acting honorary chairman of the PCB, commenting on just about everything.        
	Often, loosely.         
	Diplomats are taught to steer clear of controversies, or extinguish them should they surface, but Hasan has done his bit to ignite one. Worse, he suggested an India hand (read ICC president Sharad Pawar) at play.         
	Before the fire could take the speed of Jeff Thomson at his fastest, the ICCs chief executive, Haroon Lorgat, stepped in to rubbish talk of a conspiracy behind the world bodys decision to provisionally suspend Pakistans Test captain Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamir.        
	Yesterday, of course, there was absolute outrage when Hasan described the trio as morally upright men. Even taking that with a tonne of salt would not do.                          
	In fact, the shocker from Hasan made the ICC, which had been sleeping for four days after Sundays expose by News of the World, act, rather late on Day V.        
	While word is that Hasans outrageous certificate forced the ICCs hands, pressure had been building on it to take some steps, at least.        
	A provisional suspension, pending inquiry, ought really to have been announced within 24 hours of the sting operation.        
	Belatedly, the ICC has begun to insist that the tainted have a case to answer.        
	Details have not been made public, but Salman Butt and Co. have been charged with various offences under the anti-corruption code for players and player support personnel.        
	It is an exhaustive code.        
	The players have the right to challenge their provisional suspension. They have 14 days from the receipt of the chargesheet to indicate their desire for a hearing. The hearing(s) will be conducted by an independent Anti-Corruption Tribunal.        
	On a day of movement on spot-fixing, crickets senior-most pro, Sachin, spoke at length on an issue which threatens to tear apart the sports credibility.        
	At a promotional in New Delhi, he said: The ICC should have a thorough probe into the scandal and take appropriate action if the players are found guilty. If the allegations are true, it will certainly bring disrepute to the game.        
	Sachin, who has a spotless image, added: In my 21 years of international cricket, I have never heard of an Indian player being approached by bookies.        
	It was in response to a question on whether an approach had come from Mazhar Majeed.         
	Then, at an Indian Air Force function, where he got the rank of an honorary Group Captain, Sachin gave his take beautifully  If I make more money than the runs I score, I wont be able to sleep at night.        
	Current players have avoided talking on the subject, but Sachin has responded in the manner of an Elder Statesman.         
	Perhaps, it will not be out of place for The Telegraph to reveal that shortly before the match-fixing explosion of 2000, Sachin had strongly indicated to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that he did not wish to share the dressing room with those who had already come under suspicion.        
	That was conveyed to us by a former BCCI president who, sadly, is no more today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Regional Prison Academy expected to come up in Orissa
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Regional Prison Academy expected to come up in Orissa
                            
	Berhampur (Orissa), Aug 16 (PTI): A Regional Prison Academy is likely to be set up in Orissa to train jail officers of the state as well as from neighbouring Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.        
	 The proposed academy will come up in the state after the neighbouring states give their consent, states Inspector General (Prisons) Pranabindu Acharya said here. The Central government would provide one-time assistance for setting up the proposed academy, he said at the passing-out ceremony of the jail warders at the Jail Training School here last week.        
	 Acharya, however, ruled out shifting of the Jail Training School at Berhampur, states only training institute, to impart basic tips to the warders and the officers.        
	 Several social organisations here had expressed fear that the school might be shifted from here when the trainers were taken to Jamojhari last year. The trainers were shifted as the school has no facility to accommodate over 300 trainers, the top cop said.        
	 A permanent principal in the school would be appointed very soon with the principals post lying vacant for over a year.        
	 The school has been imparting basic training including courses in Psychology, Sociology, Criminology, Jail manual, Accountancy and Service, Law and Human Rights and Correctional Services for the prisoners to warders and officers before they join in the services.

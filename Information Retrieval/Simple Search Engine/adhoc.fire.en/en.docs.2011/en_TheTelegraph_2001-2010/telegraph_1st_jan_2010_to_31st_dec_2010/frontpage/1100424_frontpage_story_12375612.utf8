  - Housing scheme incentive to fill vacancies          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                            Too few teachers                                        
	New Delhi, April 23: The Centre is planning ambitious housing and insurance schemes for schoolteachers to make the profession attractive and fill the massive vacancies threatening to derail the right-to-education initiative.        
	The schemes, proposed by human resource development minister Kapil Sibal, will cover teachers across rural and urban India, officials have told The Telegraph.        
	The right to education law, launched on April 1, promises schooling to all children between 6 and 14. It also stipulates strict teacher-to-student ratios that schools must maintain and fixes a period within which teacher vacancies must be filled. India, however, has only about 7 lakh qualified schoolteachers instead of the 12 lakh needed to meet the norms laid down by the law.        
	Sibals ministry has asked the Educational Consultants India Limited (EdCIL)  a public sector enterprise under the ministry  to prepare a draft project report on the housing scheme. The government plans to implement the scheme through public private partnerships.        
	The idea behind the scheme is to set up a corporation that will build and provide houses along the lines of police housing corporations in the states, an EdCIL source said. EdCIL has submitted a preliminary draft to the ministry, the source added.        
	The ministry may, however, restructure the proposed housing scheme to focus more on assisting schoolteachers with block housing in privately constructed complexes, the source said.        
	The ministry is likely to consult the Life Insurance Corporation of India before drafting the insurance scheme, which Sibal proposed at a recent meeting with officials, sources said. The ambit of this scheme is yet to be decided.        
	The schemes represent the countrys latest attempt to make teaching attractive at a time the government is investing heavily in the sector. The UPA has set a target of allocating 5 per cent of the GDP on education. The proposed schemes may cover both government and private sector teachers.        
	Independent Indias biggest education policy drafting exercise  the Education Commission set up in 1964 under academic D.S. Kothari  had mulled the problem of housing for teachers. The commission suggested setting up co-operative societies and providing loans on favourable terms to build houses. No earlier government at the Centre had, however, implemented any housing scheme for schoolteachers.        
	Sibals schemes are, however, likely to prove hard to implement.        
	Private partners in the housing scheme may not wish to participate in projects in rural areas where most of the schools that are in need of teachers are located.         
	Teachers may not be willing to travel from housing facilities in cities to rural areas.        
	The insurance scheme may overlap with health and insurance programmes that government employees may already be eligible for.               
	Providing beneficial insurance cover for private sector teachers could lead to questions about the governments use of the taxpayers money.

          BIJOY KR SHARMA                              
	Dhubri, April 24: The increasing involvement of Muslim Liberation Tigers of Assam, a fundamentalist militant organisation active in lower Assam, in drug peddling came to light yesterday with the arrest of a Multa activist in Dhubri district.        
	The activist, Amiruddin Sheikh, 47, was apprehended with brown sugar valued at Rs 4 lakh at Paglahat under Tamarhat police station. Just four months ago, two Multa activists had been apprehended with 400gm of brown sugar in Meghalayas Garo hills, bordering Dhubri, on December 29.         
	Intelligence sources said Multa stepped up its drug-peddling activities after intensive counter-insurgency operations against Ulfa and the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB), which have been supporting it, reduced its strength considerably, too.        
	The NDFB and Ulfa, have formed and nurtured several fundamental organisations like Multa to get logistical support, shelter and passage in minority-dominated districts of lower Assam.         
	This is evident from the fact that many youths of minority community belonging to the NDFB or acting as its linkmen have been arrested from the lower Assam districts in the past few years, one of the sources said. In fact, two NDFB linkmen, identified as Abdus Salam, 27, and Osama Gani, 19, were arrested by the army from Bherbheri village under Golokganj police station in Dhubri district only three days back. Army recovered two crude bombs and NDFB letter pads from them.        
	The ISI is sitting at the helm of affairs and controlling the situation in the Northeast from Bangladesh and the fundamentalist organisations are carrying out their activities under the umbrella of Ulfa and the NDFB without much hue and cry, the source added.        
	However, it took a long time for the intelligence agencies to understand that Ulfa and the NDFB were using these fundamentalist organisations as their conduit, the sources said.         
	They said in the early nineties, most of the Multa activists arrested by police were dacoits with no organisational base whatsoever. They got organised after 1993 with the help of Ulfa and NDFB and also got arms training in Bangladesh. They then returned to Assam and infiltrated into Dhubri, Goalpara, Kokrajhar, Barpeta and Nalbari districts of lower Assam.        
	However, the sources said, no direct link had been found between Multa and any NSCN faction. But since Multas bosses, Ulfa and the NDFB, camped in Bangladesh and had tactical understanding with the NSCN factions for logistical support, it could be involved in arms racket. Till now, we do not have concrete evidence of such nexus. However, we are keeping a close eye on it, one of the sources said.         
	The sources said Multa initially was primarily involved in extortion and its targets were mainly teachers, headmasters and contractors of rural areas. But most of these cases went unreported and its activities came to light only in the late nineties.         
	Over the years, the activists of Multa, which at one point of time had a total cadre strength of 120, have either been arrested or laid down arms. With the elimination and arrest of many leaders of Ulfa and the NDFB in lower Assam, the rest are finding it very difficult to survive. Operating mostly from villages close to Bangladesh, they are now involved in several rackets like cattle smuggling and dealing in fake currency, besides drug peddling, the sources said.        
	The strategic location of Dhubri serves their purpose very well as the district shares an international border with Bangladesh, inter-state boundaries with Meghalaya and West Bengal and is in close proximity to Bhutan. All the narcotics routed to this part of the region come through Bangladesh. Police and army have seized brown sugar five times in the past three years.         
	An army intelligence source said Dhubri, being close to Bangladesh, was easily accessible to militant groups for safe shelter. They sneak into Assam through the porous border and mingle in the rural char area where there is hardly any administrative presence. When the heat turns on here, they easily cross over to the neighbouring country. But if such activities are not nipped in the bud, the situation can turn volatile, he added.        
	Sources said though Multa had lost considerable strength and was lying low at present, it was not totally depleted.        
	Dhubri deputy superintendent of police Sourav Jyoti Saikia said the Multa activist arrested yesterday was being interrogated at Tamarhat police station but declined to give details.

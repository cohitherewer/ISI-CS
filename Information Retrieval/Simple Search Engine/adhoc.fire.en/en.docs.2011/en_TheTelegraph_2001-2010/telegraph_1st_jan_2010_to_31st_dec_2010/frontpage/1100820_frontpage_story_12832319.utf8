  - Drought has made a once well-to-do family of farmers dole-dependent         SANTOSH K. KIRO                                                      Staring at despair: Sarju Thakur and son Anand at their house at Sutiambe village in Kanke block, Ranchi,   on Thursday.

	Sutiambe (Ranchi), Aug. 19: For 55-year-old Sarju Thakur, it is that time of the year again, when after days of anxiously scanning the cloudless sky, his bleary eyes are taking in the sight of his parched two-and-a-half acres.         
	The marginal farmer of agriculturally rich Sutiambe village in Kanke block, 15km from the state capital, is facing his second consecutive drought year.        
	Due to the poor monsoon, I have not been able to sow paddy. Had it been a normal monsoon, I would have harvested about 100 quintal paddy grains and stored 20-30 quintal at home. This year, my yield will be zero, Thakur surmised with wry resignation, nodding at his dusty fields.        
	A little later, he whispers, time is up. It strikes him that even in the case of a delayed monsoon, there is no way to salvage his damage, because the time to sow paddy has come and gone.         
	Sutiambe was the first capital of Nagbanshi rulers of Chotanagpur from where Madra Munda ruled his tribal kingdom. The historically important area is totally dependent on agriculture  all its 200-odd households subsist on farm-based earnings.         
	In fact, some farmers like Thakur used to be quite affluent by local standards. But that was before the rain shadow on the state clamped a permanent shadow on their faces.         
	His wife, Sushila, points to their well, which watered their vegetables. The vegetables raised around Rs 30,000 a year, enough to fund the education of two sons  Anand (21) is a BA student at Ranchis Suraj Singh Memorial College and Bablu (14) is in Class IX in the village Nischal Memorial High School  but now that the wells water level is alarmingly low vegetables may not grow this year.         
	Yesterday, the administration asked farmers across the state to register their names in block offices to get alternative crop seeds like urad, mung, toria, sarguja, kulthi, arhar and maize that grow in less rainfall. But the Thakurs are sceptical. By the time we get the seeds, the last dregs of monsoon will be over, is Thakurs prediction.         
	The family did not want to migrate to other states in search of a livelihood. They were confident that Sutiambe had enough to offer them a comfortable life. But this year, their confidence is shaken. Neighbours are moving in droves to brick kilns for work. Our family has held on, but we dont know for how long, says elder son Anand.         
	Since last year, they have been surviving on the state dole of 35 kg of foodgrain at Re 1 per kg given to BPL families.         
	I simply dont know what will happen to my family this year, sums up Thakur. There is nothing more to add.

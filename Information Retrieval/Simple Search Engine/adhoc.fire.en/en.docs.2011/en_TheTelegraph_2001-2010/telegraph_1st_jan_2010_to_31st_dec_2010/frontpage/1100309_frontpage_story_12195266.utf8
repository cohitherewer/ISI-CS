   Cong saddles govt with a millstone          OUR BUREAU                                                     
	New Delhi, March 8: The womens reservation bill erupted in the face of an under-prepared government today, earning it brickbats from overt backers of the contentious legislation and robbing it of critical political support from allies who staunchly oppose it.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress boss Sonia Gandhi were struggling tonight to free themselves from the squeeze of a double irony -- they have the support of the Opposition on the bill, their allies have walked away.        
	The bill itself is in peril of falling through the cracks another time.         
	At the end of the day the government and the Congress found itself pilloried from either side. The BJP and the Left lashed it for not preparing the ground well enough, and questioned its commitment to the bill.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party and Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal announced outraged withdrawal of support from the UPA, reducing its Lok Sabha majority to a thin-ice three or four.        
	Lalu Prasad, who met and sought President Pratibha Patils intervention in the matter, later said he was not opposed to reservation for women but insisted that Muslims and OBCs be provided a sub-quota within its framework. I am for 50 per cent reservation for women, but this country lives in the under-privileged heartland, let Muslim and OBC women not be robbed of their rightful share, we will never allow that, he said.        
	The stormy tabling of the bill in the Rajya Sabha this afternoon has flung the Congress and the UPA into a crisis that is suddenly no longer about womens reservation alone; it is about the future of the Manmohan Singh government itself.        
	There is palpable alarm in the government now that this could impact the passage of the budget and the survival of UPA II.         
	The Prime Minister has called an all-party meeting tomorrow but it is unlikely to throw up any resolution that will make for orderly discussion on the bill in Parliament. It is significant  and indicative of some panic in the UPA  that Singh has also scheduled a separate meeting with Mulayam, Lalu Prasad and Sharad Yadav who has risked an open divide in the Janata Dal (United) and the NDA to oppose the bill.        
	The Prime Minister is anxious not to lose the support of the Samajwadi and the RJD, sources said, even if it has to be at the cost of postponing the divisive vote.                
	Neither the Prime Minister nor the Congress leadership is innocent of the fact that in the long term it must still rely on parties like the Samajwadi and the RJD on critical issues. The BJP and the Left are supporting the womens bill, but they are not this governments allies, they are the Opposition and we cannot lose sight of that crucial reality, a Congress MP said.        
	The horns of the dilemma pricked the ruling establishment deep. Having wrapped the bill in the high symbolism of the centenary of International Womens Day, Sonia is loath to see her vaunted gift buried.         
	But with the budget, and other key legislation on Manmohan Singhs agenda, to be approved, the government is worried over being able to locate enough legislative support.        
	As one worried Congressman put it: We have found ourselves a first-rate problem, this feels like a garland made of stones, you wear it and it may well weigh you down.        
	He feigned total ignorance of what course his leaders would now take, but did not rule out yet another shove to the bill into the cold storage. Such legislation should ideally be done on the basis of a broad consensus and it is clear there is no such consensus at the moment, we have to build it, he said.        
	The BJP and the Left did not merely hammer the apparent lack of backroom consensus-building before the government brought the bill back into Parliament, they also raised doubts whether the government was serious at all.        
	There was no discussion at all, railed Brinda Karat of the CPM, and no preparation to prevent the kind of unruliness that happened in the Rajya Sabha. If nothing, we women were prepared to form a protective ring around the chairman (Vice-President Hamid Ansari).        
	The leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley, said: I have serious doubts about the intentions of the government, and now I positively think it has developed cold feet over going through with the legislation.         
	Arguing that the government should have anticipated vociferous opposition from sections, one Opposition leader put a different analysis on why the bill had been tabled in a rush. This has nothing to do with International Womens Day, said K.C. Tyagi, general secretary of the JD(U). This was done merely to divide opposition unity on the issue of price rise. In the din over the womens bill, everybody seems to have forgotten about the real and daily problems of people, and the Opposition stands totally divided. But equally, the strategy has backfired on the Congress.        
	Crisis management kicked in the moment the import of immediate political implications began to emerge. Troubleshooter Pranab Mukherjee met Mulayam Singh and Lalu Prasad, and then called on the Prime Minister to brief him on their obdurate opposition to the bill in its current shape. Soon after, the Congress core committee was called into emergency session. Sources said that several leaders counselled a detached review of the situation hinged on not risking the passage of the budget.        
	That was also the chief reason behind the governments opposition to using house marshals to remove anti-womens bill disrupters from the floor of Parliament. We need the support of these MPs in the coming weeks, a Congress leader said. We cannot be party to them being physically lifted away from the House.

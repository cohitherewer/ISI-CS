The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | On green highway, little rush
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                On green highway, little rush

	New Delhi, Jan. 10: At Indias largest auto show, car makers have been reticent on price tags and launch dates of their promised green wares, reflecting the uncertainty that hangs over the Indian market for hybrid and electric vehicles, auto engineers say.        
	For car buyers intent on an eco-statement, the worlds first mass-produced hybrid has arrived in India on the heels of the Copenhagen climate conference, whose wide coverage helped highlight the harm emissions do to the environment.        
	Toyota-Kirloskar has launched the Prius, a hybrid car that runs on a petrol engine and an electric motor and promises up to 30 per cent cuts in emissions.        
	The five-door hatchback, which made its global debut 13 years ago, comes with a price tag of about Rs 27 lakh in India, but promises 20km to 24km per litre, nearly twice the fuel economy over the petrol version, company engineers said.        
	General Motors demonstrated at the Auto Expo 2010 here a working prototype of what could be Indias first four-door passenger electric vehicle the e-Spark whose launch is planned before the end of 2010. The all-electric vehicle will have a battery that can be charged in a few hours. The company hasnt disclosed a price yet but officials say it will be affordable.        
	But other green cars on display at the car show, which ended today, had neither price tags nor launch dates.         
	The lack of local infrastructure and high import duties tend to push prices beyond the reach of the mass market, automobile engineers say.        
	Customers here are very price-conscious. Most of the technology for such cars is currently imported. Costs will drop only with localisation, said C.V. Raman, chief general manager in the research and design division of Maruti Suzuki.        
	Maruti Suzuki displayed two concept cars  a hybrid SX4 that runs on a petrol engine and electric motor and the all-electric Eeco Charge  which it hopes to demonstrate at the Commonwealth Games later this year. But the company has set no launch date for either car yet.        
	Auto industry engineers cite the experience of Honda, which had introduced a hybrid vehicle in India about two years ago, setting an initial price of about Rs 22 lakh. When the expected sales did not occur, engineers said, the company slashed the price to about Rs 13 lakh, and all the cars from the limited stock were picked up.        
	Auto industry executives point out that low-emission cars are not spared the high duties  about 100 per cent on imported cars in India. Government initiatives to reduce duties on green vehicles might help expand the market, an engineer said.        
	Industry officials say electric vehicles are likely to become popular only after India builds adequate infrastructure for recharging or refuelling the low-emission models whose prototypes are ready. For electric vehicles, well need charging stations or places where batteries could be exchanged. Most customers in India are unlikely to have garages where electric cars could be recharged overnight, a senior engineer said.        
	Tata Motors plans to launch an electric version of the Indica Vista in Europe much ahead of India mainly because of concerns about local infrastructure in this country, said a company engineer.        
	(Compressed) natural gas is likely to remain Indias main strategy for low-emission cars in the near term, said an engineer with a domestic car manufacturer. It is much more efficient when you take into account both the initial cost and the running cost.        
	A petrol-driven car with running costs of about Rs 3 per km could run on natural gas at about Rs 1.10 per km.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Poll cloud on students
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Campaign for the civic elections                                  
	The civic polls have led to the postponement of the exams of the West Bengal University of Technology, casting a cloud on the future of the final-year students.        
	Sabyasachi Sengupta, the vice-chancellor of the university to which all private engineering colleges in the state are affiliated, has written to the higher education department and governor M.K. Narayanan, highlighting the problems faced by the students because of the delayed start of the exams.        
	The exams, scheduled for the last week of May, were deferred till June 8 after the state poll panel asked the university not to conduct any test between May 28 and June 2.        
	Sengupta said the final-year students who had already received job offers might not be able to join work if the results of the semester exams were delayed.        
	Many final-year students who have been selected by foreign institutes for postgraduate courses are worried whether the results will be published in time, said a university official.        
	Many students complained that they would not be able to sit for the entrance tests for seeking admission in Calcutta Universitys MTech courses as the dates are coinciding with that of their semester exams.        
	The CU entrance test will be held from June 8 to 10.         
	Had the exams been held according to schedule, the students would not have had any problem taking the CU test, said an official.        
	An official in the state higher education department said all universities had been asked not to conduct any test between May 28 and June 2 because of the civic polls.        
	We understand the students problem but we have to use the university premises for smooth conduct of the elections, the official added.        
	Sengupta has also expressed concern over the poll panels decision to take over the universitys main administrative campus in Salt Lake for three days  from May 28 to 30.         
	I am shocked at the way the building has been taken over at a time when a series of exams are lined up, the vice-chancellor said.

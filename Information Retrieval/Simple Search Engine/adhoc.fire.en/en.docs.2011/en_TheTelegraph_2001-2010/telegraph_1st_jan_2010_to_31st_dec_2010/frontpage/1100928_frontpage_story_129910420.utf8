The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Yet another CWG theme song launched
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Yet another CWG theme song launched
        
	New Delhi, Sep 28 (PTI): In a musical stampede of sorts ahead of the Commonwealth Games, another theme song was today launched, this time for the volunteer programme in an effort to "connect" with the masses.
    Titled 'Delhi United In Spirit... In Action', Commonwealth Games Organising Committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi launched the audio CD of the song and conceded that there were "too many" theme songs for the October 3-14 event here.
    "Many a times, I have been asked that there would be how many more theme songs. Beside the official CWG song, there was recently a song on (the mascot) Shera," Kalmadi said.
    He however said 'Delhi United', composed by Tapasya band of the Manav Rachna International University (MRIU), would be hugely successful.
    "I am very happy the way the song has come up. The song is fantastic and hope it will serve the purpose," he said.

	Calcutta, Nov. 4: The state social welfare department has sought an investigation following The Telegraph expose that showed how babies can be adopted illegally and then the procedure made legal for a price.        
	Rinchen Tempo, principal secretary, social welfare, wrote to Bengal chief secretary Samar Ghosh on Monday, requesting a CID probe and a detective department investigation.        
	The chief secretary approved the request on Wednesday and forwarded it to the home department for sanction today. Once the order reaches us, we will conduct a thorough probe into the matter, said Raj Kanojia, additional director-general, CID.         
	Social welfare minister Bishwanath Chowdhury said the health department had been asked to take action if nursing homes were found to be involved.

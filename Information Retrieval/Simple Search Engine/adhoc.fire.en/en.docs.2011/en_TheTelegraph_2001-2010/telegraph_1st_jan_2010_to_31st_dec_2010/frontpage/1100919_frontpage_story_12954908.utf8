	Calcutta, Sept. 18: One more Japanese company has shown interest in setting up a speciality steel plant in Bengal, after JFE and Sumitomo Metal.        
	Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) is in talks with Kobe Steel on the proposed plant in the state.        
	SAIL chairman C.S. Verma today said a detailed project report was being prepared for the venture. It is likely to be an investment of Rs 5,000 crore, he said.

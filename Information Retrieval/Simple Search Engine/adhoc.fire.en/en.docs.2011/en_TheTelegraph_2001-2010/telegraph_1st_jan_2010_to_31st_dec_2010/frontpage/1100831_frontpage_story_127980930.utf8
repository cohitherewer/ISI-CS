	Patna, Aug 31 (PTI): Security forces have launched a massive combing operation in the jungles of Bihar's Lakhisarai district to trace the four policemen kidnapped by Maoists.
    To review the anti-Naxal operations in the state, CRPF chief Vikram Srivastava will hold a meeting with Bihar Police chief Neelmani here today.
    Sources said troops of CRPF, special counter-Naxal force SAF and state police have launched extensive search operations in the area around the Kajra hills of the district where the encounter took place on Sunday.
    Maoists have issued an ultimatum to the Bihar government to release eight of their jailed colleagues by tomorrow failing which they would kill all the four securitymen kidnapped by them.
    Sources said security forces in Jharkhand have also been alerted as the district is close to the inter-state border and the Naxals could flee to the neighbouring state.

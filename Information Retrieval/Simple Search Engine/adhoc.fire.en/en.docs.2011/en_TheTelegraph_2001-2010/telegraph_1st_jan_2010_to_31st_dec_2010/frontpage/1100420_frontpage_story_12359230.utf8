	Ranchi, April 19: Voting for panchayat elections will be held in five phases keeping in view the massive scale of the exercise, but dates were yet to be finalised, giving credence to speculation that the first-ever rural polls in Jharkhand would be delayed due to the national census.        
	State election commissioner M.K. Mandal told The Telegraph that the phases would be decided at the block level and it was up to deputy commissioners to choose a polling phase for their districts.        
	This and a number of other issues regarding the panchayat polls were discussed threadbare at todays meeting of deputy commissioners (DCs), chaired by chief minister Shibu Soren at Sri Krishna Sinha Institute of Public Administration (SKIPA) here.        
	But both Soren and chief secretary A.K. Singh remained non-committal on the dates of the polls confirming apprehensions  raised by The Telegraph in a report published on Sunday  that the state government may decide to go back on the promised deadline of June 30 in the wake of the census, the first phase of which was to take place between June 15 and July 31.         
	Singh, however, made it a point to clarify to media persons that the state was committed to holding panchayat polls at the earliest.         
	No dates were announced, but Mandal, a former chief secretary of the state, used the opportunity to address the DCs and spell out the nitty-gritty of panchayat elections.         
	He added that there would be over 45,000 polling stations across the state (against about 24,000 in the Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha polls) and noted that voter turnout was most likely to be very high.         
	 As per norms, after the state election commission is fully satisfied with preparations, it draws up the schedule for elections. The schedule is then sent to the state government which needs to approve it through a cabinet decision.         
	The governor also needs to approve the schedule after which a gazette notification is published. State panchayati raj department sources told The Telegraph that in light of recent amendments to Jharkhand Panchayati Raj Act, 2001, there is a need to rectify the rules thereof. The recent amendments were related to several reservation provisions for women and non-tribals, among other issues.

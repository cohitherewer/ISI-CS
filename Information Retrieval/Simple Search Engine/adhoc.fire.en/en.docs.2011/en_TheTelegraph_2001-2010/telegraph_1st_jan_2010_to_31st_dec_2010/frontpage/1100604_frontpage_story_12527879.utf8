	Washington, June 3 (Reuters): President Barack Obama presented Paul McCartney with a lifetime achievement award last night and the former Beatle sang Michelle with First Lady Michelle Obama looking on.        
	McCartney, 67, was given the US Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song by Obama and listened to a concert of his music performed by other singers before singing some of his own songs.

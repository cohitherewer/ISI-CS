The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dispur axe on private tuition
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Dispur axe on private tuition
  - Govt draws up list of teachers after ignoring 2002 report          DAULAT RAHMAN                                    
	Guwahati, June 11: Dispur has geared up to take action against teachers who offer private tuition, after sitting on a report involving teachers of the prestigious Cotton College for more than eight years.         
	Education minister Gautam Bora told The Telegraph that a list of such erring teachers, particularly those from Cotton College, was being prepared and the government would soon ask the heads of colleges to take punitive action against them.        
	In 2002, public activist Deven Dutta submitted a detailed report to the Cotton College authorities about several teachers of the institution being engaged in private tuition and their direct or indirect association with coaching centres.         
	He did so following a circular sent from the education department seeking information about involvement of teachers of the college in private coaching.         
	I do not generalise that all teachers are involved in tuition. But for some, tuition means a lucrative industry. There were instances when some teachers used to charge different amounts by selling what they called best notes, better notes and good notes, Dutta, who had submitted the report in his capacity as the vice-principal of the college and head of the English department, said.         
	A source said then principal late Ram Charan Thakuria submitted the report to the education department, but it only gathered dust for the next few years.         
	Dutta today said even though he himself apprised then education commissioner Prafulla Chandra Sharma about the report, the official took an escape route.                                             
	A strong lobby of teachers used its clout on erstwhile education minister Ripun Bora not take act on Duttas report, the source said.         
	Bora said the government has already asked the present principal of Cotton College, Indra Kumar Bhattacharyya, to take punitive action against such teachers.         
	He said the government would make it mandatory for teachers to attend colleges for a minimum of six hours every day. We are working on a modern methodology, including submission of monthly academic activity reports by teachers and introduction of mechanised punching registration cards to ensure that teachers do not bunk regular classes, he added.         
	The ministers disclosure holds significance as EdCIL (India) Ltd, a globally acclaimed consultancy firm under the human resource development ministry, has found Cotton College fit to become a university and has chalked out a roadmap to upgrade the institution.         
	Bora said it would not be possible for Cotton College to achieve such status unless its teachers refrained from private tuition. He said teachers would have to work tirelessly and with dedication to convert the college into a credible university.         
	The firm engaged by the Assam government in March this year to prepare a vision plan for academic and infrastructure upgrade of Cotton College has also made it clear that teachers would have to put in extra work to convert the college into a university.        
	Dutta, however, was cynical over the education ministers comments and said the government cannot dare to take action against teachers.         
	Children of several ministers and senior bureaucrats go for private tuition to score high marks in exams, he said.         
	The current principal of Cotton College said he has already issued a circular to all teachers for spending a minimum of six hours in college.         
	Being the head of a government college, I have my limitations in taking punitive action against any teacher. With the revised UGC payscales being implemented, I will make all efforts so that teachers devote their full time in college and avoid private tuition, he said.

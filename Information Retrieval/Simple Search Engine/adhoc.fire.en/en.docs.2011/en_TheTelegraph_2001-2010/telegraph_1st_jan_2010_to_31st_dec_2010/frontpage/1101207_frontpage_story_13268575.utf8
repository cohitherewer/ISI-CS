          OUR BUREAU                              Pranab Mukherjee and Mamata Banerjee                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 6: The UPA today scheduled a huddle with allies, let speculation simmer that a JPC probe was round the corner and then postponed the meeting but not before an apparently unaware Sharad Pawar turned up at the appointed time.        
	The government and the Congress publicly insisted there was no change of stand on the refusal to accept a joint parliamentary committee on the 2G controversy but a highly placed source told The Telegraph tonight that the party was willing to revisit the issue and take into account larger issues.        
	The source described one of the larger issues as whether the government should let the winter session of Parliament end next Monday without conducting normal business on a single day. The other issue, the source said, is that the government and the party want to ensure that the standoff does not spill over into the budget session.        
	The Congress core committee is expected to meet tomorrow and discuss whether the Oppositions demand for a JPC should be accepted.        
	Earlier in the day, word was spread, probably with the blessings of the Congress, that the allies had requested the government to consider forming a JPC if that would let the House function. A meeting between finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and the allies was then scheduled at 8 tonight at North Block.        
	Some sources said the suggestion for the meeting with the allies came from the Congress itself, which wanted to convey an impression that such a step was being considered because of persuasion by the allies.         
	However, as mysteriously as the rumour had originated, the meeting was called off, ostensibly because the leaders of all the allies could not be informed on time.        
	Pawar looked as if he was not informed  that the meeting had been put off. He turned up at North Block around 8pm but insisted that he had come for another meeting, one with Mukherjee to discuss matters related to agriculture, the portfolio which the Maharashtra leader looks after.        
	The UPA flip-flop has prompted suggestions that the Congress leadership was amenable to a JPC but the government, notably Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, was not keen.        
	The claim could not be independently confirmed but the reaction from some senior ministers, who strenuously denied that any plan was afoot to consider the JPC demand, reflected the governments reluctance to yield ground.        
	But parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Kumar Bansal appeared to add a conditional clause (as of now) to the opposition to a JPC. As of now, there is no JPC, he said.        
	The Congress stuck to its stated stand in public, with recently reinstated spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi describing the JPC demand as meaningless, illogical, unreasonable and political gimmickry.        
	The allies  parties like the Trinamul Congress are not against a JPC probe but have not yet openly made an explicit demand  also debunked suggestions of divisions.        
	Trinamul leader and railway minister Mamata Banerjee said her party would fully agree to whatever decision the Prime Minister took on a JPC probe. I have been saying for a long time that we are for the truth to come out in the 2G spectrum issue, Mamata told PTI.        
	Where is the question of split? We discuss, Pawar said after meeting Mukherjee.        
	Asked whether some of the allies did not share the Congress reservations about a JPC inquiry, Pawar said: It will be a collective decision. I dont think any change is there.

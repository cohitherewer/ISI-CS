	New Delhi, Sept 29 (PTI) Congress President Sonia Gandhi today appealed to the people to "accept whatever" the verdict is in the Ayodhya title suit case and maintain peace, goodwill and brotherhood at all costs.
    Amid apprehensions of breach of peace after the verdict tomorrow, Gandhi said, "Accept whatever it is, as per our great tradition of having a liberal outlook".
    "We all know that the Lucknow bench of the Allabahad High Court will be giving its judgement on a sensitive issue.
    Along with this, we know that almost the entire country has expressed its willingness to accept the judgement by imposing faith in the impartiality of the judiciary", Gandhi, who is also Chairperson of the ruling UPA, said in an appeal.
    Gandhi said, while this was a matter of pride for the high traditions of the judiciary of the country, it was also a symbol of the collective conscience of India.

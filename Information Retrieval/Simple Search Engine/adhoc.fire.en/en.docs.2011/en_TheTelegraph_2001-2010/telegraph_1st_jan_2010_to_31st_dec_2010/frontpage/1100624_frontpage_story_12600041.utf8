The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CBI to probe animal parts haul
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CBI to probe animal parts haul
                            
	New Delhi, June 23 (PTI): The Centre has ordered a CBI probe into the recent haul of 20kg tiger parts and skeletons valued at Rs 5 crore by customs sleuths from Guwahati airport.         
	Environment and forest minister Jairam Ramesh today directed a CBI investigation while expressing concern that Guwahati has become a major hub for smugglers to tranship wildlife products to neighbouring countries, as indicated by frequent hauls.        
	Rajesh Gopal, member secretary of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), said, It is a serious issue with national and international ramifications. The CBI has been asked to probe into backward and forward linkages threadbare in the case.        
	Since the customs department seized the items, the Centre considered the case fit for CBI investigation instead of handing it over to the Assam government.        
	The huge haul of tiger parts recently as well as a few months ago from the airport has put a question mark on the countrywide conservation measures being initiated to save the big cat in forests.        
	Until the poachers are reined in and demand for tiger parts curbed, the big cats in forests would remain vulnerable, notwithstanding various steps taken for its safety. This is perhaps the biggest seizure of tiger parts in recent times, Gopal added.         
	Ramesh has written a letter to the minister of state for finance (revenue) S.S. Palanimanickam to provide all possible help to the CBI.        
	While asking the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau to pool in resources along with CBI, the environment minister also stressed the need to renew enforcement strategies to check wildlife trade.

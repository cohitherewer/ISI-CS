          SANJAY K. JHA                                          Mukul Wasnik		    
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: The absence of a credible local leadership and the high commands poor election management yet again delivered a result in Bihar which the Congress finds difficult to digest. This is nothing new as the party suffered similar humiliation in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and a few other states.         
	The Congress did not expect any miracle in Bihar. Still, the results came as a shock as the high command had expected around 20 of the 243 seats, but managed only four. Despite the initial hype, created by the response to Rahul Gandhis rallies, the leadership had given up hope of any revival after the ticket-distribution exercise that evoked strong criticism from within the party.         
	Soon after tickets were handed out, one senior leader jokingly said: Even Arun Jaitley would have fielded better candidates had we asked him to distribute Congress tickets.         
	Congress workers were so angry with AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik that they themselves whittled down the initial expectation of 40 seats to 20 or less and conveyed to Sonia Gandhi the message of impending doom. Wasnik himself was booed and heckled on several occasions during electioneering. But Wasnik and the allegations that tickets were distributed for extraneous considerations instead of electoral merit are not the real problems plaguing the Congress.         
	The majority opinion is that the inability to raise credible leadership in states and overdependence on the Sonia-Rahul charisma has proved a bane for the party. The voters have repeatedly sent signals in many states that they prefer strong local leaders to charismatic election-time visitors.         
	The Congress has won in states like Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi where strong local leaders like the late Y.S.R. Reddy, Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Sheila Dikshit led the campaign. On the contrary, the Congress failed to wrest power from the BJP in Madhya Pradesh where its best leader Digvijay Singh kept aloof and others with no mass base were projected. In Chhattisgarh, Ajit Jogi was willy-nilly allowed to lead the campaign with the high command not supporting him whole- heartedly.        
	Gujarat and Orissa have been the classic examples of the Congresss failure to build local leaders against strong contenders like Narendra Modi and Naveen Patnaik. In Bihar, Sonia remained for months a mute spectator to the internal feud when a lesser-known leader, Anil Sharma, was state party president.        
	Sonia removed Sharma just before the election and appointed Mehboob Ali Quaiser, another leader who struggled to establish his identity among the voters.         
	This kind of ad hoc politics against such entrenched local players like Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad was doomed to fail. There was no organisational machinery to capitalise on Rahuls charisma and the welfare schemes launched by the Centre. The flying tours of Sonia and Rahul were not enough to break the contact the ruling Janata Dal (United) and the BJP had built with the masses.        
	The problem for the Congress will now be the opposition from within to the go-alone policy that Rahul has been advocating. Bihar was a big test for this experiment and there have been murmurs about the efforts of a section of senior leaders to defeat Rahul in his endeavour. But those who support Rahuls strategy feel the party will have realised that election-time push cannot be a substitute for long-term politics and organisational work.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 4: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee confirmed today that he would not attend the CPM politburo meeting beginning tomorrow, prompting the party to claim that the possibility of political clashes required the presence of the chief minister in the state.        
	No, Im not going to Delhi. I am staying here, the chief minister said in Writers Buildings this afternoon in his first interaction with reporters since the crushing civic poll results on Wednesday.        
	Soon after the chief minister spoke, word emerged that CPI leader A.B. Bardhan had told a television channel that the poll result was a very big defeat for the Left, no doubt about it.        
	The assertion by Bardhan, considered close to Prakash Karat whose differences with Bhattacharjee are well known, contradicts the claims of improvement made by the state CPM on the basis of statistical acrobatics.        
	The scathing comments by the CPI leader are expected to set the tone for the discussions at the politburo meeting in Delhi.         
	Indications that the chief minister might skip the two-day politburo session, which is expected to discuss the civic poll outcome although it is not on the official agenda, had emerged last night itself but some party leaders were hoping that he would change his mind.        
	 The signal that can go to the party rank and file is that he doesnt want to face the reality that the party has been routed in the municipal polls and that the same can happen under his stewardship next year. That can be very frustrating for our party cadres who will feel let down, a CPM leader said today.        
	For the record, the CPM said Bhattacharjee was staying back because of political clashes.        
	 After the municipal elections, the situation has become tense in many districts. There are reports of political clashes and the law and order condition may worsen any time. So, at this juncture, the chief ministers presence is needed in the state. Thats why he is not going Buddha has also discussed this with Karat, CPM state secretary Biman Bose said.        
	Four persons have died in clashes in the past 48 hours but a direct link with the civic polls has not been established yet. Bose added that the civic polls in Bengal were not on the politburos agenda.         
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen, close to Karat and sidelined during the civic poll campaign, will also skip the politburo meeting. Nirupam cannot make it to the politburo meeting because of some important work in the districts, Bose said.

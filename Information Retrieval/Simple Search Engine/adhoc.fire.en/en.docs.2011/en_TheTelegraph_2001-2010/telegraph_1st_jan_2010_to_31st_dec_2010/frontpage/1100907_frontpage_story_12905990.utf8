          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today indicated that he was aware of the controversy in Bengal about alleged armed camps of the CPM in areas around Lalgarh.        
	The Prime Minister did not name the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government or the CPM but referred to the picture of The Telegraphs principal correspondent, Pronab Mondal, whose hand was fractured when he and six other journalists were attacked on Friday.         
	Replying to a question on Mamata Banerjees allegations on the issue, Singh first said: I dont want to comment.        
	The Prime Minister followed it up saying he had seen the picture (above) in The Telegraph of the injuries that the CPM attack on journalists had caused. There was the picture of The Telegraph reporters arm in bandage.         
	(Mondal tonight underwent a surgery on his left forearm at a Calcutta hospital. A metal plate was fixed to his broken bone.)        
	The Prime Minister stood by Union home minister P. Chidambaram who had talked of the armed CPM camps. What needs to be done has to be done, he added.

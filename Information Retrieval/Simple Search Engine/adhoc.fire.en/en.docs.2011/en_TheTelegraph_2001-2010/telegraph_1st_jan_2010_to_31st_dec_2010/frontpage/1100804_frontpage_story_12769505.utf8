          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: Suresh Kalmadi was summoned by foreign minister S.M. Krishna this morning and confronted with evidence that the email he had furnished to defend himself over a controversial Commonwealth Games-related contract was doctored.        
	South Block eschewed a public statement about what an official dubbed an amateur cut-and-paste job to avoid national embarrassment, but sources said Krishna gave Kalmadi an earful for dragging his ministry and Indias London mission into the scandal.        
	After the morning pasting came an unkind cut in the evening. News arrived that the Commonwealth Games Federation president, Michael Fennell, would be in Delhi on August 18 and had asked the Indian government to look into all the corruption allegations against the Games organisers.        
	The setbacks forced Kalmadi to form a three-member team to probe not only the email forgery but also alleged corruption in the Games organising committees purchase/renting of air-conditioners, treadmills, umbrellas and the like.        
	Kalmadi, who heads the Games committee, had claimed British firm AM Films had been hired on a recommendation from a London high commission official to provide transportation, accommodation and other services during the Queens Baton relay in London last October. He had produced as proof an email, purportedly sent by Raju Sebastian, a junior mission official.        
	The foreign ministrys electronic governance and IT division was then assigned to scrutinise the missions emails sent in September and October last year. And sure enough, it found that particular email Sebastian had sent the Games committee, citing details of London hotels and their room rents.        
	Its content matched the one Kalmadi had produced on Sunday  almost. Except that the last two lines, in which Sebastian purportedly introduced AM Films as a company on the missions list of approved vendors, were absent. They were inserted later, a ministry source said.        
	AM Films and a sister concern, both owned by NRI Ashish Patel, were hired without a tendering process or a written contract and paid Rs 3.2 crore. Sources alleged AM had filed for liquidation in July, that it was Patels modus operandi to float companies and shut them, and that he frequently changed his address. They said organising committee officials T.S. Darbari, who is close to Kalmadi, and Sanjay Mohindroo had drafted Patel.        
	The sports ministry has demanded that Kalmadi sack Darbari and Mohindroo. Darbari, being probed for some time by revenue intelligence, is joint director-general in the Games committee. He could not be reached for comment. Mohindroo quit the committee sometime ago.        
	The three-member probe panels report will be placed before the Games committees executive board on Thursday, when a decision will be taken on Darbari.        
	The panel will also probe allegations of irregularities in the hiring of Sports Marketing and Management, an Australian firm contracted to raise sponsorships for the Games. Reports in the Australian media quoted company officials as denying the charges.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           Vananchal Express at Ranchi station on Tuesday. Picture by Hardeep Singh       
	Ranchi, July 20: Three people from the state capital reportedly perished in yesterdays train mishap at Sainthia though no official word is available on how many people from the state lost their lives in the accident involving the Ranchi-bound Vananchal Express and Uttar Banga Express.        
	According to unofficial sources, three people from the city  Pandra resident Diwakar Prasad Rao, Piska More resident Ranjeet Verma and Upper Bazar resident Manoj Sarangi  died in the accident.         
	Railway sources said 21 bodies were at Burdwan Hospital, awaiting identification.         
	In the otherwise bustling Ranchi railway station, an eerie calm prevailed. The station, which caters to 10,000 passengers on a normal day, saw barely 6,000 passengers using the services of 42 up and down trains today. Even the special train from Sainthia rolled in sans any passenger.        
	Porters, vendors and parcel clerks said the footfall was far less than normal and their business had been hit by 50 to 70 per cent.         
	I sell biscuits and chocolates worth Rs 5,000 everyday, but today I could only get Rs 1,500 as there were too few passengers, said Surendra Kumar, who runs a shop on platform No. 1.         
	Booking agent Gopal Sharma at the stations parcel office said he did not book any two-wheelers today. At least 10 two-wheelers are sent everyday, but today there was none. Its as if people want to avoid using trains after yesterdays accident, he said.         
	Porter Indrajeet Singh too complained that he had made only half of his usual earning of Rs 400.         
	However, station manager Dinesh Kumar Bariar denied that there was any change in the number of passengers using the station today. When shown a photograph of a nearly empty Vananchal Express today, he said change in schedule could have hit passenger traffic.         
	Vananchal Express is not running according to its scheduled time of 2.50pm so passengers may be avoiding it, he said.        
	The special train that left Ranchi yesterday at 1.15pm for Sainthia returned virtually empty this evening at 5.57pm.

	Ranchi, May 2: Hemant Soren and Co. have sought an honourable exit for chief minister Shibu Soren, a condition the BJP leadership believes reflects the JMM legislature party leaders inability to exercise control over all 18 of his party MLAs.        
	Hemant, who returned to the state capital today along with Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto, JD(U)s Jaleshwar Mahto and state BJP chief and deputy chief minister Raghubar Das, said he had not backed out of his offer of allowing the BJP to head a new government.         
	All that we want is a respectable solution to end the political crisis, he told The Telegraph.         
	The JMM wants the BJP top brass to allow Soren to continue till June 30 after which he would have to quit since he wouldnt be able to get himself elected to the Assembly.         
	Hemant said yesterdays discussions in Delhi were cordial and positive and veered around ways and means to take the state forward.         
	Insisting that Guruji would continue to be chief minister, he denied the BJP had issued a deadline of seven days for him to quit and for the JMM to come out with a letter of support.        
	He said Guruji was the tallest tribal leader in the country and the post of chief minister did not mean anything to him as he had several milestones in his long political career.         
	It was because of his ill health that he wasnt contesting a by-election, Hemant claimed.         
	Maintaining there was no rift within the JMM, Hemant said: We do not want the Centre to impose Presidents rule. Our allies, including the BJP, Ajsu and JD(U), do not want Presidents rule either, he said.        
	Sensing the ongoing deadlock was unlikely to be resolved soon, the Opposition mounted an offensive on the government. Babulal Marandis JVM said the Soren government had gone into a coma.        
	No official will now take him seriously now that everyone is sure he will not be at the helm of affairs after two months, Marandi said.        
	The BJP, too, has been left exposed as a blatantly opportunistic party that can reverse the decision of its highest policy making body for the sake of power, he added.

	Srinagar, Oct. 24: The three-member team of interlocutors for Kashmir had some success in breaking the ice when a group of stone-throwers met them today despite the boycott call by Hurriyat hardliners.        
	The interlocutors led by Dileep Padgaonkar arrived here yesterday, days after they were appointed by the Centre to talk to various shades of opinion in Kashmir.         
	Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani has asked people not to talk to them and has set five conditions for dialogue with New Delhi.         
	However, a group of protesters, including boys who participated in recent incidents of stone-throwing, met the interlocutors away from the media glare.         
	I wanted to bare my heart and tell them the truth, which is that the people of Kashmir want azaadi, said one of the boys, a student.         
	I told them that I lost my leg to a bullet fired by security forces in a 2008 agitation. I was not throwing stones then. I cannot join the streets to throw stones now but I support the cause of protesters.         
	Academic Radha Kumar, one of the three interlocutors, said they had invited some youths and they did not come on their own. We listened to them and we believe their grievances are understandable, she said.         
	The interlocutors, who are here on a four-day visit, have said they will visit Kashmir every month and take the process forward. The decision of some protesters to meet them is important in that context.         
	Last night, the interlocutors met the Opposition PDP leader and former deputy chief minister Muzaffar Hussain Baig and also visited Srinagars central jail to meet detainees. Baig chose to meet them despite his partys opposition to the teams composition. The PDP wants some senior politician to lead the dialogue process.         
	Moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq today announced a signature campaign to draw the attention of US President Barack Obama, who is visiting India next month, to Kashmir. We urge him to help in resolving the vexed issue according to the wishes and aspirations of the people of Kashmir, the Mirwaiz said.

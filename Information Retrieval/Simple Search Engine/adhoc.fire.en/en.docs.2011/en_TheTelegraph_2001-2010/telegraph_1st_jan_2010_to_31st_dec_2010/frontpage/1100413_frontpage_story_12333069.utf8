          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                            Eden Gardens, during an IPL match                                   
	New Delhi, April 12: On one side were lined up some of the gladiators among the worlds ills: Terror threat, global warming, power crisis, traffic snarls, noise pollution.        
	The other side only boasted a local toughie: mandays lost because of truancy at work.        
	And cricket, sorry Lalit Modi, won.        
	The Supreme Court today dismissed a petition that argued that IPL matches should be held during the daytime because night games were a security risk and the floodlights were likely to worsen the power shortage.        
	At least 60,000 to 70,000 people watch an IPL match at a time, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan observed.        
	If they are held during the day, at least 60,000 people wont work. If all people go and watch these matches no one will work.        
	The bench scoffed at claims by the petitioner, Calcutta-based green activist Subhash Dutta, that floodlit matches could add to the power problems racking several parts of the country, including Bengal.        
	The February 23 petition had cited the Eden Gardens power failure during an India-Sri Lanka game last December, a year and a half after a blackout during an IPL game in 2008.        
	Power supply is stable, the bench observed caustically. Besides, this (issue) is not for the courts to decide, the Chief Justice said.        
	Dutta had also claimed that a ban on night games would reduce carbon footprints on the environment, traffic jams and noise pollution.        
	Traffic management during night hours becomes more difficult. The routine traffic and police forces are withdrawn from their daily duties and are deployed for event management, the petition said. Besides, the heavy goods traffic is held up.        
	Unnecessary honking and victory celebration sometimes stretches beyond midnight causing discontent among the people at large, the petition said. Moreover, the probability of extremists attacks is more during night hours and there is the added difficulty in security arrangements after dusk.        
	Dutta had also sought to have the electricity, stadium and security costs for IPL games recovered from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).        
	The income generated from IPL matches goes to the coffers of a non-government body like the BCCI and to different other private organisers of individual teams, but the money is spent from the state exchequer for making the tournament a success, the petition said.        
	It said the state should recover the expenses from BCCI and others and spend the same for other welfare purposes including games and sports.        
	Dutta had listed the Bengal chief secretary, the BCCI, the IPL chairman and the Union sports ministry as parties to the case.

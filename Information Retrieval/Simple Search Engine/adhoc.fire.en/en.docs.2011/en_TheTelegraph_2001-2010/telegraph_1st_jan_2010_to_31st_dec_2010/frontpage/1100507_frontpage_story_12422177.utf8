	Imphal, May 6: NSCN (I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah today postponed his visit to Manipur even as two students were killed when his supporters in the state clashed with security forces at Mao, an entry point from Nagaland.        
	The situation at Mao flared up around the time chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh met Union ministers in Delhi to review the crisis arising from Muivahs decision to visit his native Somdal village in Manipurs Ukhrul district.         
	The Manipur government had decided not to allow Muivah to enter the state, parts of which the NSCN (I-M) wants to include in its plan for Nagalim, citing law and order problems.        
	Authorities in Manipur said the trouble began in Mao when a large number of Muivahs supporters marched through the town to protest the state governments stand.         
	Eyewitnesses said the police fired teargas shells to disperse the protesters who retaliated by throwing stones and setting a police bus on fire. They also damaged two police trucks. The police fired in the air to control the mob.         
	Sources said Manipur Rifles and India Reserve Battalion personnel gunned down two protesters near Town Hall, 2km from Mao bazaar, when a group ransacked their temporary camp and set fire to their belongings.         
	The two have been identified as Nili Chakho and Dikho Loshuo, both 19 years old and students.         
	Some reports from Nagaland claimed that the police resorted to indiscriminate firing when they failed to disperse the mob. Seventy-four people, mostly women, were injured.        
	The Centre had summoned Ibobi Singh this morning to brief senior Union ministers on the situation arising out of Muivahs proposed visit. He met home minister P. Chidambaram, defence minister A.K. Antony and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.         
	Ibobi Singh told the ministers that Muivahs trip would lead to law and order problems. Ibobi Singh returned to Manipur in the afternoon and convened a cabinet meeting in which the decision not to let in Muivah was reaffirmed.        
	Muivah has deferred his visit till the Centre gives him the go-ahead.                     WITH INPUTS FROM H. CHISI AND ARCHIS MOHAN

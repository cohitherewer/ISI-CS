  - Minister appeals for peace amp; progress        OUR BUREAU                                          
	Shillong/Manipur, Dec. 14: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today said barring Assam and Manipur, peace had returned to the other northeastern states.         
	However, he said, settlement of the long-pending demands of various groups were very much within the reach of both the government and the militant groups. All that was required to reach a solution was a little more understanding on the part of both parties.        
	Almost all the groups are in talks with the government. The settlements are within our reach and we can reach it with a little give-and-take and a little more understanding, the home minister said at the passing-out ceremony of police officials at the North Eastern Police Academy (NEPA) at Umiam, 20km from Shillong. He landed at NEPA in an army chopper around 10.15am and left for Imphal around 1.20pm.        
	On arrival in Imphal this evening, he interacted with students at G.P. Womens College and reviewed the law and order in the state with chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh and top officials of the security agencies. He will visit some designated camps of Kuki militants in Churachandpur district tomorrow to review the preparation for talks with those outfits that have signed the tripartite suspension of operation.         
	The ministers statement on give-and-take assumes significance in the context of the demands of various militant groups in the Northeast, varying from statehood to sovereignty. He did not elaborate on the modalities of the give-and-take approach, but his statement indicated that the Centre was ready to listen to the dem-ands of the militants with an open mind but wanted the outfits to reciprocate similarly.        
	Chidambaram said the government had made elaborate efforts for the last two years to hold (out) the hand of friendship to all militant groups to discuss their problems. We only say violence has no place in democracy, he added.         
	He said almost all the groups in the region were in dialogue with the government through specially appointed interlocutors.        
	The home minister said the Northeast had a special space in India and in our hearts and without militancy it would be a place of peace and harmony, a paradise, where thousands would flock from the country and abroad.         
	In Manipur, he said the states boundary would not be redrawn and urged students to become the vehicle of change and usher in peace, progress and prosperity.         
	With this statement, he sought to discourage the United Naga Council from demanding an alternate administrative arrangement, the NSCN (I-M) from seeking integration of Naga-dominated areas and the Kukis from demanding a Kuki state under the Constitution.

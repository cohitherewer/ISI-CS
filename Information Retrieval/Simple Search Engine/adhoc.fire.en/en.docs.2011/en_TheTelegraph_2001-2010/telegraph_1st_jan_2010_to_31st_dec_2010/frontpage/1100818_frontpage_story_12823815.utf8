                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Panchayats, sport in Dec. race
	  - Raj Bhavan must choose between two key events 									      SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA       GAMES   BEHIND GAMES                                          
	Ranchi, Aug. 17: Busy tackling drought, Raj Bhavan is now caught between holding two landmark events scheduled for December: Jharkhands first-ever panchayat polls or the chance to host the already delayed 34th National Games.        
	We are firm on completing the panchayat election process by December 15. We have to choose between that and the Games scheduled to begin from December 9. We believe the panchayat elections are more important for the state. But we are yet to take a final view, governors adviser V.S. Dubey told The Telegraph.        
	If the stakes are loaded heavily in favour of panchayat polls, not held in the state for over 30 years, it is also because the National Games Organising Committee (NGOC) is already facing serious charges of financial irregularities.        
	Raj Bhavans added concern is also centred around a key question: should the state vigilance bureau be asked to probe and book those involved in committing financial irregularities while buying sports equipment and awarding contracts for various services or hold an inquiry till the sports event is over?        
	We are in a fix. Should we opt for a vigilance probe into the affairs of the Games as detailed by the principal accountant-general or wait for the Games to be over and then hold a probe like in the case of Commonwealth Games? said a source close to the governor.         
	Dubey refused to comment on the probe question, but added that all issues would be sorted out at a meeting to be held after tomorrows visit of a central team to assess the prevailing drought situation.        
	NGOC working chairman R.K. Anand has already scheduled a meeting with Governor M..H. Farook on August 20 on various questions plaguing the Games.         
	In an earlier conversation with The Telegraph, he had said he was open to a thorough investigation into the various deals struck by the committee with regard to the Games, and indicated he was now not so sure about being able to adhere to the December schedule.        
	In any case, NGOC has to resolve a host of issues. It has to pay at least Rs 20 crore to various contractors with whom it signed contracts for buying sports goods and availing of various services.         
	Also, the firms may not agree to provide the services on the same rate to which they agreed to a year back. There is no provision for revision of rates in the contract. So, tenders will have to be reinvited, said a senior NGOC office-bearer.        
	Besides, we have to finalise a reply to the objections raised by the principal accountant-general, he added.        
	NGOC has already incurred financial losses for not being able to adhere to the original schedule.        
	It doesnt help that NGOC is a divided house. Working chairman R.K. Anand does not see eye to eye with IOA chief Suresh Kalmadi, who constituted a screening committee headed by Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay only to keep Anand in check.

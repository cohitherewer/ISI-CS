          ROB HUGHES                      Rooney                          
	London, Oct. 22: Wayne Rooney and his advisers performed not so much an about-face as a complete about-farce this week.         
	On Wednesday evening, the United star player issued a statement saying that he no longer regarded the club as worthy of his talents. He had no intention of signing a new contract.         
	On Friday morning, he signed a fresh deal tying him to United for another five years.        
	 Admirers believe that Rooney is the most gifted English sportsman of his generation, and in the top handful of soccer players on earth. Detractors consider him to be lacking the brain cells to conduct his career accordingly.         
	The evidence of the past week suggests that both points of view are valid. When a player aged 24  he will be 25 on Sunday  treats his own club so whimsically he is lucky in the extreme not to be shown the door. In another time, Uniteds manager, Alex Ferguson, or any experienced manager or coach, would have escorted the player and his agent out of the stadium.        
	Nowadays, there is too much money at stake to do that.         
	Wayne has apologised to me and to the players, Ferguson announced on the clubs television channel on Friday. Im sure he will also do so to the supporters, because thats important.         
	The manager, old enough to be a grandfather to many of his players, added: I said to the boy that the door is open.        
	Rooneys agent had released the ill-worded statement that claimed that the star wanted out. It was not about money, the statement claimed, but about trophies. The Rooney camp had lost faith in United buying the best players to compete at world level.         
	There was a grain of truth in Rooneys statement. Anyone can see that United is not buying the really big stars any more. So yes, if you are the best English talent of your age and you think the owners cannot compete in team building, you get concerned.         
	That said, it was the crude, selfish, ultimately self-wounding statement that Rooney released on Wednesday that almost scuttled his future at the club.         
	The now-contrite Rooney said he had been reassured that the club matched his ambitions. He also, no doubt, edged closer to the 150,000 per week he was allegedly demanding to stay.         
	The club never discloses salaries. But if Rooney is getting so many more millions, that takes away from the pot to buy the players he says he wants at his side. Contradictions abound.         
	Rooney, who is not playing because of an ankle injury, has a big birthday celebration to arrange at his country mansion. When Rooney returns, about three weeks from now, he will need to win over his teammates.         
	Coleen forgave you, read a banner at the Old Trafford stadium on Wednesday night, referring to his wife. We wont.         
	They might if he knuckles down to being again the best player on their team.                     NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

  - EC notifies symbols for panchayat elections        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                                     
	Ranchi, Oct. 21: Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Saurabh Tiwary take note. The batsman and the bat are both up for grabs as symbols for the forthcoming panchayat polls in the state.        
	The batsman happens to be among the 75 free symbols available with the State Election Commission for use in the panchayat polls, which will elect mukhiyas, members of gram panchayats, panchayat samitis and zilla parishads. The bat is among 20 reserved symbols.        
	Since the elections are not being fought on political lines, the familiar party symbols will be missing from the fray.        
	From carrots, brinjals, coconuts and maize to coats, cars, aeroplanes, cameras, almirahs and baskets, from torches, briefcase, cots, cup and saucer to dolls, spoons, frocks, hats, purse and pressure cooker, the symbols waiting to be distributed are many.        
	While the batsman and the lady with an earthen pot are the only two figures depicting the human form, the Commission has not notified any animal symbols, perhaps in a bid to avoid any controversy in a state known for its flora and fauna. The 20 reserved symbols have been kept aside for allotment in case the free symbols for various categories are exhausted.        
	Interestingly, the batsman and bat symbols have not gone down well with the political parties.        
	Congress MLA Geeta Shree Oraon said the symbols were ridiculous as the rural electorate would not be able to identify with them. The candidates opt for symbols that can be identified with and are easier to coin slogans with to send their message across the electorate, she said.        
	BJP Kisan Morcha president Ravindra Rai said the nominees will opt for symbols which have relevance in rural areas. So, the people will avoid the batsman, he said.        
	JVM legislature party leader Pradeep Yadav, however, said that the game of cricket had percolated to the grassroot level and the images associated with it could come handy to lure voters, particularly the youth.        
	Symbols play a great role in the elections, particularly in areas where a large part of the population is illiterate and they identify the candidates by their symbols and not names, Yadav said.         
	State election commissioner S.D. Sharma said the Commission had picked up free symbols available with the Election Commission of India. We have not gone beyond it, he added.        
	Since four ballot papers have to be used simultaneously, we have to allot symbols for every post, he added.

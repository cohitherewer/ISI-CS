                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Euro brand bouquet for mall
          SUBHRO SAHA                            The Cologne megastore of Vero Moda and Jack amp; Jones                                  
	A clutch of premium European brands is set to nest in South City Mall, right on cue to catch the Puja shopping fever, providing a welcome perception prop to a city bottom in the pecking order.        
	Jack amp; Jones, Vero Moda, Only and Pieces, four top-notch European apparel and accessories brands under the umbrella of Danish retail giant Bestseller, will open their doors at the Prince Anwar Shah Road shop-eat-hangout address in end-August.        
	The entry of the much-talked-about labels follows the announcement of Courtyard at Forum to host an international brand bouquet led by the likes of Mango and Aldo, suggesting that the citys retail stocks are on recovery track.        
	Shoppers aspiration levels are constantly shifting, as they upgrade through the retail rungs, from a Spykar to a Levis to a Guess. Our latest offering of these Bestseller brands will satiate that growing desire to a large extent, and encourage other overseas labels sitting on the fence to take the plunge, Manmohan Bagree, vice-president (commercial amp; marketing), South City (Projects) Kolkata Ltd, tells Metro.        
	From Copenhagen to Cologne to Calcutta  the brands will have the same price tag, a policy designed to cater to todays well-travelled urban professional, a leveller tack the Danish group feels will find increasing acceptance in the city like elsewhere in the country.        
	The core product of Jack amp; Jones is fashionable jeans, cut-edged and funky coloured, targeted at the 20-35 age group.        
	The target customers for Vero Moda are young women between 20 and 35  the liberal, highly sophisticated fashionista  while Only caters to teenage girls and young adolescents. Pieces, an accessories brand, completes the basket.        
	Calcutta is an important market for us and in our quest for a pan-India footprint, this is an extremely critical location. We might later think of a second outlet for our brands. For the moment, we are looking to consolidate our presence in the East and Northeast, with Calcutta as the hub, says Sumit Suneja, real estate and business development manager, Bestseller Retail India.        
	The hit Calcuttas retail image had taken after a string of big-ticket pullouts, including that of Marks amp; Spencer and other top brands like Guess and Next from Avani Heights on Chowringhee, can be offset to some extent by the entry of these international brands, observes an industry expert.        
	The Bestseller group has two more brands in its kitty  Selected, a high-end, clean-cut mens line, and Exit, the kids range  which it plans to bring to town subsequently.        
	Our stores around the world follow an international template design done in Copenhagen, and for the South City outlet as well, we are shipping in all in-store motifs and fittings from the Danish capital, adds Suneja.        
	As it gets ready for the European quartet, South City Mall is also in an advanced stage of negotiations with Timberland, a global leader in the design, engineering and marketing of premium-quality footwear, apparel and accessories, and Esprit, both of which could open shop before Puja.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP mum on JMM flip flop 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                BJP mum on JMM flip flop

	New Delhi/Ranchi, May 8: The Jharkhand crisis hovered between resolution and escalation today with chief minister Shibu Soren insisting on a rotational power-sharing arrangement, hours after the JMM and Ajsu had agreed to a government led by the BJP.         
	The BJP did not react to Sorens statement, made at the Ranchi airport along with senior party leader Hemlal Murmu this evening, its silence adding to the political uncertainty that prevails in Jharkhand now for almost a fortnight.        
	Earlier in the day, at a meeting this morning in New Delhi, the BJP stuck to its guns about not accepting the chief ministers chair on a rotating basis. The party also made it clear that the JMM could not dictate who its chief minister would be.         
	BJP president Nitin Gadkari spelled out to Hemant Soren and Subodh Mahto that if they persisted with their pre-conditions, he was ready to sacrifice power and settle for a spell of Presidents rule if no other viable coalition emerged.         
	As Presidents rule would have meant a free run of the political field for the Congress, which could have also split the JMM and BJP to rustle up the numbers for a majority, Soren and Mahto agreed to the deal.         
	However, speaking to newspersons at the Birsa Munda airport soon after his arrival in Ranchi, the JMM chief said the BJP would form a new government in the state for the time being as he would step down in a day or two. He added that the leadership of the government during its entire tenure would be shared equally by the two parties.        
	Who will be the new chief minister will be decided by the BJP parliamentary board in Delhi on Monday. Thereafter, observers would come to Ranchi. In due course we will finalise our formula for sharing of berths in the state cabinet, the chief minister said.        
	The BJP parliamentary board will name the new chief minister on Monday. Sources said the candidate will most probably be a legislator and not an MP.         
	If this view prevailed, it put paid the chances of Lok Sabha MPs Yashwant Sinha and Arjun Munda whose names were circulating earlier.         
	The names of the present deputy chief minister Raghubar Das and state health minister, Neelkanth Munda were in currency.         
	The BJP is reportedly eyeing the post of Speaker and two more ministers in addition to the chief minister. Its expectation is in line with the earlier formula of representation in proportion to the legislative strength by which the BJP had secured speakership and three ministers. The JMM too was entitled to four ministers under this arrangement that a source stressed would not be disturbed.         
	In Ranchi, state welfare minister Haji Hussain Ansari, however, said the JMM would take the speakers post.        
	In another development, senior JMM member Simon Marandi said he stood by his previous proposal to form a JMM-led government, even if it amounted to parting ways with the BJP.         
	Sources said Marandi today also spoke to incarcerated party legislator Paulus Surin and discussed his future strategy.                          
	At least six JMM leaders are strongly opposed to supporting a BJP-led government. I am sure more MLAs will soon join our fold. But, I am not like Hemant Soren, who takes every decision independently and calls it the partys decision. I will first talk to my like-minded party colleagues and decide my future course of action accordingly, he added.        
	State HRD minister Hemlal Murmu, however, argued that the decision had been taken in the larger interest of the state.         
	We dont want Presidents Rule and fresh elections at this juncture. The decision to support a BJP led government for now has been taken by a majority of party MLAs. Others will have to accept this. In the later half of the current tenure of the government, we will be leading it again, he added.

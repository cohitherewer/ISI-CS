The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | AASU protest threat on NRC
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                AASU protest threat on NRC
  - Govt accused of instigating violence        A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Guwahati, July 27: The All Assam Students Union today threatened to launch a statewide agitation if the pilot project on National Register of Citizens, 1951, update was not resumed before August 15.         
	The students union also accused the ruling Congress government of instigating the All Assam Minority Students Union (AAMSU) in triggering communal violence in the name of the NRC update.         
	The AASU asked the students union not to vitiate the atmosphere by communalising and politicising the NRC issue.         
	AASU adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya told the media that the Tarun Gogoi government has already surrendered to the pro-Bangladeshi lobby by postponing the NRC update process soon after the Barpeta violence last week.         
	Bhattacharyya said the update of the NRC was a long pending demand of the indigenous people of the state and the union would not tolerate any further disruption in the process.         
	The Barpeta incident was orchestrated by some pro-Bangladeshi forces and aimed at provoking the AASU to resort to similar violence. But the AASU does not believe in violence and has been working for peace in the state. If the process is, however, not resumed before August 15, the union will be forced to resort to an agitation. The two-day executive committee meeting of the AASU, which ended today, extensively discussed the NRC issue, he said.         
	The students organisation criticised government spokesman and health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for his statement to the media that the NRC update would be delayed because of some existing flaws in the process.         
	Bhattacharyya asked if there were flaws in the NRC update forms, why has the government remained silent on the issue till the Barpeta violence?         
	If there are flaws, the government must immediately rectify and simplify the procedures, he said.         
	The AASU did not understand as to why an organisation like AAMSU found it wrong to make the NRC, 1951 and electoral rolls up to 1971 as the base document to update the NRC. We want the names of all those, irrespective of (whether they are) Hindu or Muslim, who came to the state prior to March 21, 1971, be incorporated in the NRC, the union leader said.         
	In June, Dispur started the pilot project for updating the National Register of Citizens, 1951, in Chaygaon and Barpeta revenue circles amid an air of uncertainty over whether the modalities to determine citizenship would include DNA testing.        
	Application forms were made available at panchayat, lat mandal, block, circle, municipal and town committee offices, police stations and police outposts.         
	On the other hand, the government has decided to convene an all-party meeting of citizens organisations, AASU, Asam Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad and minority organisations to chalk out a suitable formula to resume the NRC work.         
	Sources, however, said Dispur was unlikely to start the process immediately, considering the sensitive nature of the issue.

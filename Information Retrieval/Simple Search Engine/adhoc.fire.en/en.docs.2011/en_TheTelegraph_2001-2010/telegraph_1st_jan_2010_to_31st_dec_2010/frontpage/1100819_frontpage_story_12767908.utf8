The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | City a safe market for banned drugs
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                City a safe market for banned drugs

	In Calcutta, it doesnt take much of an effort to get a dose of deadly drugs. Be it the Sealdah station parking lot, the Esplanade bus depot or the Bypass, they are available almost everywhere under bright sodium vapour lamps.        
	We have arrested at least 12 peddlers in the past month. A cache of banned drugs was seized from them. Officers of the narcotics wing keep a close watch on the trade, said Damayanti Sen, the joint commissioner of police (crime).        
	But a dozen arrests count for nothing in a trade that involves thousands of people. Those rounded up must have been promptly replaced by another dozen.        
	Metro went around the city and spoke to some shadowy figures to find out how police are paid to look the other way.        
	In the event of a police crackdown, it is the peddlers who are targeted. Big operators are left to carry on their trade. So the city is never short on supply, and one can see people injecting or snorting drugs in broad daylight, in front of schools or under flyovers.        
	Heres a peek into how the racket works and a consignment, worth around lakhs, is split into small purias available somewhere near you.              
	The market: On the bottom rung, women run the show. Purias or small packets of brown sugar tucked inside their blouse, they search for potential customers.        
	At least 80 women, from vegetable and tea vendors to vagrants, sell purias priced between Rs 30 and Rs 50 each at Sealdah.        
	Policemen cant search them. The lack of women cops is a big advantage for us. We have men who lead clients to us, says Khushi (name changed), a drug-peddler at Sealdah station.        
	Khushi and others like her have Big Brothers who run the show from behind.              
	Big Brothers: At least 25 key operatives are responsible for running the drug show in Calcutta and its adjoining areas, says an officer of the detective departments narcotics wing.         
	The area of operation of each operative is well demarcated. For example, Mohammad Sabir and a woman nicknamed Bariwali run the racket in the port area.         
	Their territory covers Kidderpore, Ekbalpore, Watgunge, Taratala, Behala and Thakurpukur.        
	At least 3,000 men and women work as channels, spreading banned drugs across the city and its neighbouring areas.        
	How a consignment is split into purias: The key operatives source their material  consignments weighing 1-2kg  from their counterparts in other states and Nepal and Myanmar, says an officer. They have couriers who ferry the consignments to the city.        
	In Calcutta, there is said to be a three-tier distribution system. The drug lords, who invest several lakhs on one consignment, divide it into packets weighing 50gm to 100gm and sell them to another group, the second tier. This group splits the consignment into the smallest unit, known in the market as the puria.        
	The third level comprises hundreds of men and women, like those selling purias outside Sealdah station.        
	Greasing palms: The police get a share of the money that is exchanged at every level, says a drug dealer.         
	At Sealdah, Khushi assures customers that they need to pay only Rs 20 to the police if they get caught.        
	She pays a constable Rs 20 every day. Officers, from the state police to railway police, get Rs 500 every week.        
	Big-ticket trade: Its worth crores. The drug mafia invest nearly Rs 150 crore every year. They dont have to wait for profits because drugs fetch instant money, says an officer in the narcotics wing.        
	Easy money: The drug business is considered the most profitable venture in the citys underworld. Everyone, from the law-keeper to the person preparing purias, makes quick money.         
	If a drug lord invests Rs 80 lakh on a consignment, he will sell it at not less than Rs 2 crore. Although he has to bear some costs for logistical support, which includes bribing cops, the profit margin is still unbelievable, says a city detective.        
	Peddlers like Khushi, too, make a 100 per cent profit. If she sells a puria for Rs 30, she must have brought it for Rs 15 or even less, the officer adds.        
	We have a daily trade of close to Rs 15,000, says Mala (name changed), another peddler at Sealdah.              
	The route: Consignments seem to come from all directions. Police say one route originates in Afghanistan, from where drugs reach Punjab via Pakistan. The consignments arrive in Calcutta through Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Manipur is another major source for drugs.

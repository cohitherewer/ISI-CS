                                Thilo Sarrazin                            
	Berlin, Aug. 29 (Reuters): German government leaders condemned a central bank executive on Sunday for making anti-Semitic remarks before the publication of his book on Monday that takes a critical look at Turk and Arab immigrants.        
	Foreign minister Guido Westerwelle and defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg said Thilo Sarrazin was out of line for comments about Jews, remarks that were also criticised by Jewish leaders in the country responsible for the Holocaust.        
	All Jews share a particular gene, Basques share a certain gene that sets them apart, Sarrazin told Welt am Sonntag newspaper ahead of the release of his book Deutschland schafft sich ab (Germany does away with itself).        
	Sarrazin, a Bundesbank board member, denied he was stirring racism. He has faced heavy criticism for making disparaging comments about Muslim immigrants. Sarrazin has repeatedly created uproar for criticising Turks and Arabs in Germany.        
	Theres no room in the political debate for remarks that whip up racism or anti-Semitism, Westerwelle said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | You India? Iran home
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                You India? Iran home
          SUJAN DUTTA                                          Ahmadinejad greets Indian participants at Tehran University on Monday.   Picture by Dilip Banerjee      
	Tehran, Dec. 13: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today went out of his way to greet an Indian contingent of peacemakers on an overland caravan to the Gaza Strip, choosing a raucous student meet at the University of Tehran where the audience had to walk over Israeli, US and UK flags, to get into the packed auditorium.        
	Ahmadinejads unannounced visit to the university, with hands folded in a namaste, where a representative of the Indian delegation in the humanitarian aid mission, Ashim Roy, presented the agenda of the Asia to Gaza caravan, took everyone by surprise.        
	This Asia to Gaza caravan shows that Palestine is no longer just an issue between Arabs and Israel, between Jews and Muslims. It shows that above all it is a humanitarian issue, Ahmadinejad said.        
	The Indian government has a stated policy of support to the demand for a Palestinian nation. But over the years, Indias ties with Israel, especially its military-to-military relations, has intensified. India has also abstained from voting or has voted against Iran on sanctions imposed by the UN in the last two years.        
	In May this year, Israeli commandos and activists on a Freedom Flotilla to Gaza clashed, leaving nine Turkish aid workers killed. The Asia to Gaza Caravan is part of the same campaign.        
	Ahmadinejads presence at the meeting today, convened by students to welcome to mission, is almost an official endorsement of the Asia to Gaza Caravan by the Iranian government.        
	The Iranian President is known for his virulent rhetoric against Israel and the US. While that was part of the extempore speech he gave here today, he was careful to address an audience in India, saying that the mission that started from Raj Ghat in New Delhi on December 2 will grow and flower like a tree.        
	Last month, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had equated Palestine with Kashmir. To express displeasure, India abstained from voting at the UN Security Council on a Canadian resolution against Irans human rights record. India had traditionally voted against such resolutions in the past.        
	Today, Ahmadinejad greeted and kissed Roy, who spoke before him on the objectives of the caravan, on the cheeks.        
	Then, from the identification tag, Ahmadinejad marked out this correspondent of The Telegraph, who was trying desperately to get a quote out of him, and said: You India, India? No question, no time. But welcome, welcome. Iran home.        
	The President continued to wade into the crowd of Indians at the corner of the stage  about 50 Indians make up the largest contingent of the Asia to Gaza Caravan  and shook hands even as security guards staved off the crowd and the audience went ballistic with militant slogans in Hindi, Urdu and Persian.        
	Since the Indian delegation, known as the India Lifeline to Gaza, entered Iran on December 8, it has been greeted by thousands of Iranians in Zahedan, Kerman, Yazd, Esfahan and Qom. At almost every reception and gathering, the speakers had repeatedly harped on how important the unresolved Palestine-Israel dispute is to the Muslims of the world.        
	Ahmadinejad chose this forum today to widen and intensify support for Palestine outside the Islamic world, describing the siege of Gaza by Israel, which has refused to recognise the Palestinian Authority since the militant Hamas won the elections in 2008, as a humanitarian issue above all.         
	All the crimes known in the history of humanity have been committed in Palestine, said Ahmadinejad. Palestine has a history full of injustice. Today, it is clear to everyone that the Zionists are not Jewish or Christian or Muslim or of any other religion. They just do not belong to any religion, he said.        
	Peace be unto you, the audience responded in a chorus.        
	Ahmadinejad spoke from a stage decorated with the flags of all the countries from which the participants in the caravan came from.        
	After his speech, Iranian journalists, eager for quotes from Indians, kept asking each participant whether he or she was Muslim. The Indian contingent of 50 has people from most faiths practised in the country, many of them non-Muslim.        
	The pro-Palestine non-government-sponsored peace mission, the first of its kind from Asia, also includes smaller contingents from Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, Pakistan and Azerbaijan. The caravan is to be joined by delegations from Iran, Turkey, Syria and Uzbekistan along the way.        
	The march to the University of Tehrans technology faculty auditorium before Ahmadinejads sudden appearance was a sight in itself. Indian students and NGO activists waved the Palestinian flag and led the slogan-shouting at the centre of Felestin So (Palestine Square). where a stone sculpture of resistors sits in the middle of a roundabout in front of the turquoise-domed Imam Sadeghi Mosque.        
	Headscarved Indian women, some of them students, joined Iranian women in black hijabs in the march from Felestin So to Inquilab So and the university.        
	Because I am covered and draped in black I know the world cannot see me, said Dayyanneh, a 21-year-old student of theology. It does not mean that I cannot see the world, she added.        
	An Afghan doctorate student of pharmacy, Mehdi, walked up to ask if he could join the caravan. An Iranian activist and student of Spanish language, Javod Asghani, who spoke English fairly, said that even though he has been part of the campaign, he did not expect so many Indians to march up Ayatollah Taleghani Street in Central Tehran.        
	Activists of the anti-Israel militant outfit Hezbollah party, that is based in Lebanon and is widely suspected to be supported by Iran, also joined in the march. The Hezbollahs yellow flag with the symbol of a gun mounted on a pick-up van was waved gustily alongside the Palestinian and Iranian flags.        
	Among the slogans that resounded the most were From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free and Intifada, Intifada  free-free Gaza.        
	The caravan is slated to leave for Zanjan and Tabriz tomorrow before crossing the border into Turkey.

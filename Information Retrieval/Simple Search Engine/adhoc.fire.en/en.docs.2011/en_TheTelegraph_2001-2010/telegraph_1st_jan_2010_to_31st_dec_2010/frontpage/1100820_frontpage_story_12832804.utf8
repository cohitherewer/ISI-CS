          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Jayalakshmi Asokan      
	London, Aug. 19: Jayalakshmi Asokan has taken only baby steps, compared with the geniuses gathered in Hyderabad, but her accomplishment in Britain underscores how math knows no language barriers.        
	Today, as A-level (school final) results were published across the UK, anecdotal reports flooded in of Indian children doing well. But given the difficult start Jayalakshmi had, her performance has been hailed by teachers as exceptional.        
	She gained three A* A-levels in math, further math and chemistry and an A grade in physics. For an A* (A star), a pupil has to get more than 90 per cent.        
	When Jayalakshmi arrived in Britain from Kerala two years ago with the dream of pursuing a career in chemical engineering, she had difficulty understanding her teachers. The girl had enrolled at Preston College where she had to rapidly improve her grasp of spoken English.        
	I spoke English but not that fluently, and I could not understand the slang here, said Jayalakshmi, the daughter of a professor of mechanical engineering in India.        
	The first time I went to class I didnt have a clue what was going on, she said. I had to ask the other students if the teacher had started the lesson because I didnt know what he was talking about. The college saw the problem and gave me counselling while the teachers helped me by talking slower while my English improved.        
	She had to take a weekly course in English alongside her other studies as she gained an ESOL (English for speakers of other languages) qualification. My parents were really supportive, especially my father who was my inspiration in math, said Jayalakshmi. I would also like to thank my teachers and friends.        
	Her tutor Sue Holder said: Jay is a perfectionist by nature a dedicated and hard-working student who has been a pleasure to teach.        
	Jayalakshmi should have no problems now getting a place to read chemical engineering at a top university but first she wants to spend a year working as a volunteer with a cancer charity.

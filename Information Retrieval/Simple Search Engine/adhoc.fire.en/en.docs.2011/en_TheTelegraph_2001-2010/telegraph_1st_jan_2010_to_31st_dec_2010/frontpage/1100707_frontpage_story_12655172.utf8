  - Groom calls on Rahul Gandhi with Amethi cricketer to thank MP for best wishes           RASHEED KIDWAI                              Dhoni, Rahul                                      
	New Delhi, July 6: A famous face with a familiar smile dropped in at 10 Janpath today to meet Rahul Gandhi, and basked in the admiration of Congresss Dhoni.        
	Rahul congratulated the newly wed Mahendra Singh Dhoni, sources said, applauding him for the speed with which he had gloved his bride within 24 hours of the engagemtent.        
	The Congress general secretary also admired the way Dhoni had succeeded in keeping his marriage plans a secret and outwitted the medias ever-hungry cameras. The cricketers wide grin, the sources said, showed how much he was enjoying the compliments.        
	Its anyones guess if Rahuls accolades stemmed from a secret plan to take a similarly fast and surprise dive into matrimony. Dhoni is two things that Rahul is not but could possibly become soon: Indias captain in his field of work, and a husband.        
	The two young stars have risen together in the past, one such coincidence earning Rahul his Congresss Dhoni moniker. The day the young Gandhi took over as a party general secretary three years ago, Team India lifted the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa under Dhonis leadership.        
	In the Congress, with its tradition of sycophancy, it was quickly dubbed a great omen for the Gandhi scion.        
	Rahul appeared to have unwittingly taken the Dhoni comparison rather seriously. The next day, when the Congress Working Committee met at 24 Akbar Road, he suggested that the committee extol Team India.        
	The party immediately picked up the cue, spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi telling the media: The spirit of youth was reflected on Monday afternoon (September 24, 2007) when Rahul Gandhi took over an important position and Dhoni and his team delivered a magnificent victory to India.        
	Sources said Dhoni arrived at 10 Janpath today in the company of close friend and cricketer R.P. Singh, who is from Rahuls constituency of Amethi. A sign of the captains political savvy?        
	Sources said Dhoni wanted to personally thank Rahul for congratulating him on his engagement. Rahul was among the handful who knew about the cricketers marriage plans and is said to have phoned him hours before his engagement in Dehra Dun on Saturday.         
	Sonia Gandhi too was home but a source explained: The appointment was only for meeting Rahul Gandhi.         
	Dhoni and Rahul have known each other well thanks to a network of common friends and their shared passion for cricket, football and fast two-wheelers. A common love of bikes is said to have bonded Rahul with Dhoni and actors John Abraham and Salman Khan.        
	Last year, Rahul was spotted at a specially built and carefully camouflaged racing track 25km from Delhi, enjoying the thrills of power biking (on a Yamaha R1) and go-karting with brother-in-law Robert Vadra.                                            
	On another occasion, Rahul was seen cycling in Delhi in a blue T-shirt, red shorts and sunglasses while two vehicles packed with SPG personnel tailed him.        
	Dhoni had bought a Harley-Davidson soon after the World Twenty20 triumph and rides it whenever he is in hometown Ranchi. He is said to have refitted the machine with new exhausts and batteries bought in Australia.        
	While Rahul and Dhoni have excelled in biking, the young Gandhi has apparently been a tad defensive on the cricket field. Each time he has captained in a friendly, he has chosen to field first and has restricted himself to fielding rather than picking up the bat. In his social relationships too, Rahul appears a little restrained despite his wide circle of friends.         
	Dhoni was careful not to offer the MP tips on marital bliss. But Rahul would have noticed the glow on his face and the spring in his steps.

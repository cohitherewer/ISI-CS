	Calcutta, Dec. 9: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today blamed the Centre for Bengals fiscal woes but finance minister Asim Dasgupta cannot bridge the states widening income-expenditure gap unless the RBI accepts a proposal mooted by the Left government.         
	The cash-strapped Bengal government has requested the apex bank to liberalise the norms for ways and means advances (WMA) that help tide state governments over temporary mismatches in receipts and payments.         
	The Bengal government has asked for liberalising the norms for WMA so that they can get a higher quantum of loan and keep it for more number of days, said D. Subbarao, the RBI governor. He was speaking after a meeting of the central board of the bank in Calcutta.         
	A few hours after the RBI governor acknowledged the receipt of the request  a clear indication of the Bengal governments dependence on loans and advances to meet its expenses  the chief minister blasted the Centre for not releasing funds meant for development projects in Bengal.         
	The central government collects a huge amount in the form of taxes from the state but we are not getting anything in return. We had requested that at least 50 per cent of what Bengal contributes to the central coffers be given back to the state but we are not getting it. They are not even giving funds that they had promised, Bhattacharjee told a rally of government employees.         
	This is not the first time that the chief minister has blamed the Centre on the same subject.        
	But the timing of the attack came as a surprise as the government  which has run up a cumulative debt of around Rs 1.9 lakh crore  needs a bailout from the Centre, over and above the relaxation in WMA norms that Dasgupta wants the RBI board to consider.         
	The contrast in the approaches of the chief minister and the finance minister again establishes that good politics and good economics do not go hand in hand, said a city-based economist who did not wish to be named.         
	According to him, Bhattacharjee had to be aggressive as he was addressing one of the core constituencies  government employees  of the ruling Left. Dasgupta, tasked with managing the finances of the debt-ridden state, had little option but to bow before the RBI board.                                 
	Knocking on the doors of the RBI has become a habit for the state government in the past few years as its receipts have lagged behind expenses. Data available till July 31, 2010, reveal that the Bengal government approached the RBI 38 times for special WMA (advances against Government of India securities) and 12 times for normal WMA.         
	Sources in the Writers Buildings told The Telegraph that the state government had liberally used the overdraft facility last month when it had borrowed above the limit for seven consecutive days.         
	A committee under the chairmanship of M.P. Bezbaruah had set the normal WMA limits in 2005. According to the recommendations of the committee, the normal WMA limit applicable to Bengal was Rs 545 crore. For these advances, the Bengal government has to pay an interest rate equivalent to the repo rate  at which RBI lends money to banks, pegged at 6.25 per cent at present  provided the advances are repaid within three months.         
	If the state government delays repaying the loan, it will have to pay an interest rate of one percentage point above the repo rate, or 7.25 per cent. In case the advances cross the WMA limit  described as overdraft in banking lexicon  the applicable rate of interest becomes 8.25 per cent even if repayment is made in two weeks.        
	The apex bank charges 5 percentage points over the repo rate if the advance is paid after two weeks.         
	The government can borrow from the market by paying discounts at 8.5 per cent, but it is difficult for a debt-ridden state to mobilise funds from the money market. But if the RBI relaxes the WMA norms, the state can access funds at repo rates and thats what the finance minister is eyeing, said a senior state government official.         
	At the beginning of this financial year, the state government had set a market borrowing target of Rs 15,500 crore, out of which it has borrowed Rs 9,500 crore till last month. This means, the government is banking more on cheaper RBI funds than taking the market route to mobilise another Rs 6,000 crore.         
	According to a senior state government official, a relaxation in WMA norms is the only hope for Dasgupta as the state has failed to increase its revenue collections.         
	Unless we increase revenues, the situation will not change and the debt burden will keep moving northwards even if the government manages cheaper avenues of loans and advances, said the official.

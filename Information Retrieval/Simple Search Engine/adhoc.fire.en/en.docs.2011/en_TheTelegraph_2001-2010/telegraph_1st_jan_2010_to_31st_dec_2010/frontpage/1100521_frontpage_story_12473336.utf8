	Rajahmundry (AP), May 21 (PTI): Heavy rains after cyclone Laila severely disrupted rail and road traffic in East Godavari district today.        
	Two trains--Circar Express and Simhardi-- from Kakinada have been cancelled while some express trains are running 2-3 hours late due to water logging on the railway tracks following heavy downpour, Special officer, South Central Railway (SCR), Raman told PTI.        
	All Nellore-bound trains have been cancelled while Gouthami, Ratnachal, Prasanthi, East Coast, Konark and Machilipatnam trains have been slowed down and are running late, he said.        
	The railway technical staff has been alerted and works have been undertaken on a war footing after movement of trains was affected due to the cyclonic storm, the official said.        
	We are keeping a watch on tracks between Vijayawada-Anakaplli area and a check on signalling besides opening special counters in Vijayawada, Rajahmundry, Eluru, Tadepalligudem, Nidavolu, Kakinada, Tuni, and Annavaram railway stations to meet any eventuality, Raman said.        
	Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) has suspended some of its bus services in the district after trees and electric poles were uprooted in the cyclonic storm, snapping power and communication links and leaving several villages and towns in darkness.

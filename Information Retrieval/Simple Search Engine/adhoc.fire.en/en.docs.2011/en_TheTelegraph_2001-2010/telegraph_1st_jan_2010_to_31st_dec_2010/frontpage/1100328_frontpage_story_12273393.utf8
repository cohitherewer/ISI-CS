	Calcutta, March 27: The Bengal Club-The Telegraph Panel Discussion on The faith corporates have in the budget is misplaced covered everything from whether the hullabaloo about the budget was justified and the importance of the budget for captains of the industry to whether India actually had a liberal economy and how important an actor the state was.        
	 For Ashok Desai, consultant editor of The Telegraph and the only one in the (Bengal Club) room who has made a Union budget, the budget had been of great importance to business when corporate taxes were very high.        
	We used to get over 50 memorandums from different chambers of commerce telling us what to do with the taxes. Businesses could save money by lobbying us. In this country, businessmen concentrated more on politicians than on their business and that is the reason for the poor shape of the country, said Desai.        
	For Hero Honda managing director Pawan Munjal, the budget is still a huge event for companies because it is important for their businesses.        
	The government should show us the path for the next three to five years. Tell us the trends. We need to know where we are heading. I want to know how much money is being spent on infrastructure, roads, agriculture and the rural sector because that is where my customer is, said Munjal.        
	Munjal through his statement answered the question raised by moderator Rudrangshu Mukherjee whether the state was a principal actor in the liberal economy.        
	The importance of the budget for companies was, however, rubbished by the next panellist. Counselage managing director and Graphiti columnist Suhel Seth termed the Union budget an exercise in mental exaggeration and refused to believe that India was a free market.        
	Seth accused companies of kowtowing to those in power. We crawl when we are asked to walk. When we are asked to jump, we ask how high. I have never seen any industrialist rate a Union budget below five. It is always above five so that they can err on the side of caution, Seth said.        
	According to Seth, the industry will never question in public the power that is because it is worried about skeletons in its closet.        
	Investment banker Udayan Bose said: Do the corporates influence budget? Yes, of course, they do.         
	 Every time there is a budget, we jump up and down thinking that this will be a big-reform budget. But the big reform in budget has already happened, Bose added.        
	Ashok Ganguly, Rajya Sabha MP and chairman of ABP Pvt Ltd, which publishes The Telegraph, talked about poverty and how the focus should be on its eradication.        
	For Ganguly, budgets in a large democracy like India take on a life of their own because they affect the people.        
	He criticised industry captains for their blinkered vision and their high-handed attitude in analysing, criticising and paralysing the budget. Industry captains are pontificating on what the finance minister should have done. I think it is the height of arrogance, Ganguly said.        
	For minority affairs minister Salman Khursheed, the budget is all about telling the people about the development of India. The budget tells you about the development of India, about the India that we had and the piece by piece dismantling of that India, whether in terms of taxes or regulation, Khursheed added.        
	He referred to the budget as an exercise in public-private co-operation that is the need of the hour.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	New Delhi, April 22: Tiger conservation is classy and caring for pet dogs cute. But running a sanctuary for ill-treated street donkeys?        
	Thats when upwardly mobile India will call the police.        
	Britons Bob Harrison, 67, and his wife Jean, 69, are horrified to find this out, just as they had been when they found out about the donkeys of glitzy Gurgaon many years ago.        
	These animals make up a silent army that slogs over 10 hours a day so that the swank malls and soaring apartment blocks can come up in the tech town on Delhis border. The donkeys, seen at every construction site in Gurgaon, carry heavy loads, sometimes without food or water for long hours, and often fall sick or suffer injuries in accidents.        
	When that happens, the Harrisons pick them up and give them love and tender care in the makeshift shelter on the forecourt of their home in an upscale Gurgaon locality.        
	But their neighbours living in their plush apartments built with the toil of these animals dont want donkeys sauntering around the Harrisons courtyard. They have urged the police and civic authorities to shut the shelter, claiming the animals stink and create a din, preventing people from sleeping at night.        
	The complaint has shocked Bob, a former immigration investigator with the British high commission who took early retirement in the late 1990s to start his Asswin Project charity with Jean.        
	We keep the injured animals in an enclosed place. They (the neighbours) claimed their children were afraid to venture out because of the animals, but we have assured everyone that all our animals are sterilised and vaccinated, said Bob, whose work is funded largely by his own pension.        
	The real reason for the complaint is that one of the neighbours is building a gym and is afraid his clients might not be too happy to visit it because of the donkeys.        
	The neighbours have also complained the donkeys are attracting pigs but Bob says its a leaking sewage pipe at the back of his neighbours homes that is drawing the pigs.         
	There are plastic bags everywhere, noise and pollution from construction sites, but they arent complaining about that. They are afraid of harmless donkeys, Bob said.        
	Every afternoon for years, Bob has been driving his ambulance to areas where the donkeys toil and helping the ones that need care. The problems began when he had to bring some of them home.        
	Initially we worked with Maneka Gandhi at her donkey shelter, but then she didnt want any help from us any more, so we started our own NGO, Bob said.        
	Their troubles may not last too long, though. The municipal commissioner has promised the Harrisons a plot near their home to keep their beloved animals. Yes, hopefully we will get land. Its not that everyone here is unhappy. We tend to the dogs of many people here; they come to our house and socialise with us too. Its just some who have a problem, said Bob, who has four donkeys in his courtyard at the moment.        
	I have given up seven years of my career for this; I love these animals. Once we rescued a donkey that had a serious injury in her leg. When we got her home and tended to her, we realised she was pregnant. We then realised we had saved two lives. Its very fulfilling.        
	Bobs neighbours, when contacted, chose silence.

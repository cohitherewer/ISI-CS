          RUDRA BISWAS                              
	Ranchi, April 1: The state government tried to sugar-coat a bitter price pill today by announcing it would continue with a part of the subsidy on cooking gas which meant a cylinder would now be priced at Rs 333.20, Rs 11 less than what it would have been had the Soren government stuck to its decision of a complete withdrawal of subsidy.        
	And though diesel prices came down marginally  from Rs 38.04 a litre to Rs 37.42 a litre  by a revision in VAT rates, a delay in the government notification meant that not all petroleum dealers were willing to sell at the reduced rates from the morning, especially in Ranchi and Jamshedpur.        
	On Monday, deputy chief minister Raghubar Das had announced that the existing subsidy on cooking gas  Rs 40 per cylinder  that had been in force since 2008-09 would continue only till March 31. This led to a wave of protests. But, today Das said a group of ministers, who met last night under the chairmanship of the chief minister, agreed to continue with the subsidy but only to the extent of Rs 11.         
	The price of a cylinder will now shoot up from Rs 91.60 to Rs 333.20, which included VAT of 4 per cent. Jharkhand Cooking Gas Dealers Association president Jayant Chauhan confirmed the new rate would come into effect from today.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dhubri, March 27: The All Rabha Students Union extended its 48-hour bandh in the Rabha-Hasong areas, which ended this evening, by another 24 hours after one of its leaders was arrested this morning in the wake of largescale violence.         
	The Rabha students and the Sixth Schedule Demand Committee had called the 48-hour bandh from 5pm on Thursday to protest against the governments dilly-dallying in including the community in the Sixth Schedule.        
	During the bandh, protesters set ablaze five cars and seven motorbikes and damaged two cars and four motorbikes at Maldhara, Moijanga, Dhupdhara, Mechelkhowa, Karuabhaka, Joiramkuchi and Medhipara in Goalpara district. Arson was also reported from Palasbari and Rani in Kamrup district.        
	Police arrested Kishor Rabha, the president of the unions Dhupdhara anchalik unit, and another member of the unit, Ritu Rabha, around 11am this morning after a motorbike was set ablaze at Dhupdhara bazaar and another was damaged at Dhanubhanga, a few kilometres away on National Highway 37.         
	Both the driver and the pillion rider fell down and were injured.        
	The police had arrested the unions Dudhnoi unit office-bearers, Pratul Ronkha and Forsing Rabha, on Tuesday as a preventive measure.        
	The union today demanded the unconditional release of all its arrested members.         
	The president of its Goalpara district unit, Harish Baida, said the bandh had been extended by another 24 hours in protest against the arrest of the unions office-bearers.        
	Sources said when the police and CRPF personnel went to arrest the duo this morning, they cordoned off the unions Dhupdhara anchalik unit office and fired in the air to disperse the crowd that had assembled in front of the office building.        
	We have also demanded a judicial inquiry into the firing at the ARSUs Dhupdhara office and over the police atrocities on our activists. They chased our activists who had assembled there to enforce the bandh. Police and CRPF jawans let loose a rein of terror by caning them and opening fire, Baida said.        
	He warned that though their movement was still democratic and peaceful, the Rabhas were becoming restless and violent because of the delay in including the community in the Sixth Schedule and in holding elections in the Rabha Hasong Council area.              
	Goalpara superintendent of police Luice Aine said abettors of violence would be dealt with an iron hand. On the unconditional release of ARSU office-bearers, he said the question of conditional or unconditional release of abettors of violence did not arise as they (the ARSU) had gone back on their word.        
	Vehicles remained off the road during the bandh and shops and commercials establishments remained closed in many places in the Rabha-Hasong area.

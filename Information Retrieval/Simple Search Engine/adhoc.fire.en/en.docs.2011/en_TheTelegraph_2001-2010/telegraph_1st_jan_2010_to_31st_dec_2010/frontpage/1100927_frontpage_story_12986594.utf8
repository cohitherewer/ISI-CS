  - Trinamul chief avoids thorny assurances in Darjeeling, steps up efforts to win new friends        VIVEK CHHETRI                            Mamata stands draped in two khadas, silk scarves traditionally used by Tibetan Buddhists to honour guests, in Darjeeling on Sunday.

	Sept. 26: Mamata Banerjee lost her spectacles today but appeared to have negotiated the slippery political terrain in Darjeeling without stumbling in the first leg of her two-day trip to the hills.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief has so far managed to keep the parties in the hills happy without giving any concrete political assurance.        
	Any misstep during the trip  part of Mamatas efforts to get a toehold in all corners of the state  will prove expensive in the plains where no party can afford to be seen as endorsing any effort to divide Bengal again.        
	The lone political demand put forward by a Gorkha Janmukti Morcha delegation, led by its president Bimal Gurung, was sidestepped by Mamata.         
	The GJM (Morcha) requests you to take necessary initiative for the inclusion of the Gorkha-dominated areas of Terai and Dooars in the proposed interim authority, a political memorandum submitted by the Morcha read.         
	The inclusion of the areas from the plains in the interim authority, an administrative arrangement suggested by the Centre till 2012, is a contentious demand that has been stoutly opposed by the Bengal government.        
	However, Mamata reportedly told the Morcha that since the issue is being handled by the Union home ministry and since the talks are progressing, it would be apt for the home ministry to decide.         
	Gurung seemed happy with the overall talks and decided not to make an issue of the absence of political commitment.        
	According to sources, the Morcha does not intend to push Mamata too hard now because of the greater role she is expected to play in the state next year. She is visiting Darjeeling as the railway minister and we laid stress on issues regarding the development of the region and the railways, Gurung said after the meeting.         
	The Morcha does not have too many potential allies to choose from. The Morcha and the CPM are at loggerheads while the hill partys experiment of fielding Jaswant Singh has not paid off much with the exit of the BJP from power at the Centre.        
	Mamata will attend a public event, organised by tour operators, at the Mall tomorrow.        
	Not that the hills did not send any message to Mamata. Thousands stood along the Sukna-Rohini road, showering flowers and shouting Mamata Banerjee welcome and We want Gorkhaland, as her cavalcade of 25 cars wound its way up.        
	The last such rousing welcome was given to Darjeeling MP Jaswant Singh when he visited the hills to file the nominations for the 2009 Lok Sabha elections.        
	Mamata reciprocated, stepping out of the car all of a sudden and putting a khada (silk scarf) on a 60-year-old woman trudging uphill with a bundle of grass. Some drew parallels with Rahul Gandhis style but Mamata is no stranger to working crowds.        
	Once she arrived at the Darjeeling circuit house, it emerged that her spectacles were missing. However, a new set could be arranged from a local shop within an hour. It was possible because Didi knew her (focal) power, said one of the aides who waved a bill.        
	Asked if the Morcha was looking at forging an alliance with Trinamul in the coming days, Harka Bahadur Chhetri, a spokesperson for the hill party, said: It is too early to comment. We will cross the bridge when we reach it.        
	Without wasting any time, the CPM assailed her and drew a parallel with her trip to Lalgarh which, like the hills, has been out of bounds for the ruling party. Mamata Banerjee is running to those who kill people. Days after visiting Lalgarh to align with Maoists, she now rushes to Darjeeling to join hands with the Morcha. It is the Morcha that has brought the BJP into the hills, CPM central committee member Mohammad Salim said.        
	CPM state chief Biman Bose issued a statement without naming her but playing on concerns over the division of Bengal. If somebody aligns with those who are trying to divide Bengal, it is condemnable, he said.

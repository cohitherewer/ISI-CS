The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Russia ranked as danger hub for journalists
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Russia ranked as danger hub for journalists
                            
	MOSCOW, April 28 (Reuters): A U.S.-based media rights watchdog on Wednesday urged Russian prosecutors to investigate an attack on a journalist in Sochi, as Russia will host the 2014 Winter Olympics.         
	Russia is ranked one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists and cases involving violence against them are rarely solved. Despite calls from Western governments and rights groups, the killers of Kremlin critic Anna Politkovksaya and U.S. citizen Paul Klebnikov are still at large.         
	According to the report of news site Caucasian Knot on Monday two unidentified men attacked the editor of Sochis independent Mestnaya newspaper, with metal rods. The 62-year-old editor, Arkady Lander, was returning home with groceries. The reporter (Lander) is in hospital with fractures of the skull, a brain concussion and lacerations on his head, Radio Free Europe reported on its website.         
	Witnesses and the editor himself can identify the attackers, said Nina Ognianova, Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). We call on the officials responsible to prevent impunity from prevailing in yet another case of a physical attack on a Russian journalist, Ognianova replied in a statement.        
	Neighbours had seen the attackers in the building in the days leading up to the incident, the news site reported. It said Landers head was bludgeoned with the rods, but he was not robbed and nothing was taken from his home.        
	The spokeswoman of the local Prosecutors Office in Sochi, a city on the countrys Black Sea coast with a population of 400,000, said she was not aware of the incident and requested questions to be submitted in writing by fax on Thursday.        
	Mestnaya, a free paper with a circulation of 50,000, has written critical articles accusing authorities of rigging local elections.        
	CPJ says 19 journalists have been murdered for their work since 2000 in Russia. Last year four reporters were killed in Russia. According to CPJ, Russia is the fifth most dangerous country for reporters after the Philippines, Somalia, Pakistan and Iraq.

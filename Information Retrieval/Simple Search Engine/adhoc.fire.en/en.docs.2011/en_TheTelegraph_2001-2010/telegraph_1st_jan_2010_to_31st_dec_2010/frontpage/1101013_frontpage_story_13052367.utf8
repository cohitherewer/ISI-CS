          OUR BUREAU                                        BS Yeddyurappa      
	Oct.12: The shadow of Presidents rule in Karnataka has receded for the moment with chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa agreeing to seek a second vote of confidence on October 14, three days after he technically won a trust vote.        
	Sources said the Centre was forced to seek a softer option after Karnataka High Court adjourned hearing on the 16 disqualified MLAs plea till October 18 without staying the Speakers order axing them. The Union government had been waiting eagerly for a signal from the court on whether it might find the disqualifications illegal.        
	The compromise arrangement, which nixes the BJP governments controversial voice-vote victory yesterday but gives it a second chance, also resulted from some senior Union ministers unhappiness at the role played by governor H.R. Bharadwaj, the sources added. A minister from Karnataka apparently played a lead role in the Centres decision, which was conveyed to Bharadwaj.        
	The court proceedings also encouraged the BJP to agree to the new direction from the governor. For, they can now argue on October 14 that the disqualification of these 11 BJP and five Independent MLAs under the anti-defection law still stands.        
	This will mean that the strength of the Assembly will be down to 208 from 224, and that Yeddyurappa will need 105 votes. The states law minister, Suresh Kumar, claimed the government had 108 votes, counting that of Speaker K.G. Bopaiah.        
	Veteran lawyers and politicians said they had never heard of any state or central government in India being asked to prove its majority twice, a contingency on which there are no rules or even conventions.        
	Nudged by the Centre, Bharadwaj today asked Yeddyurappa to demonstratively and conclusively prove his majority through a division of votes by Thursday.        
	He told reporters he had never recommended Presidents rule in Karnataka.        
	I only said theres a constitutional breakdown. I have not changed my stance at all, he claimed. I am just making an offer to the chief minister. There is a doubt about him. Let him come and clear it. It is for his own good. I am being a friend, thats all.                                
	Legal and constitutional experts had yesterday criticised the governors pro-activism, especially his direction to the Speaker not to disqualify the 16 MLAs.        
	Bharadwaj said the voice vote, carried out amid chaos and the presence of the police in the House, was a farce.        
	Proper norms were not followed and I have no clarity on the numbers. Hence it is necessary to ask them to prove their majority again, he said. The number of those voting aye or nay is not counted during a voice vote.        
	Yeddyurappa initially sounded confrontationist and said he would first consult legal experts and the BJPs central leaders. He flew to Delhi with his MLAs and met top leaders, including party president Nitin Gadkari and L.K. Advani.        
	By the time the partys core committee met at Advanis home this evening, the BJPs tone had softened. Yeddyurappa attended the meeting with his law minister and the Karnataka BJP chief.        
	The party decided that with the court not having stayed the 16 MLAs disqualification, the situation did not look too bad though the margin would be wafer-thin in a second vote.        
	We wanted to avoid a face-off with the governor and not give an impression that we have abdicated our constitutional obligations, a source said. If the governor was slammed for his over-reach, the chief minister had not emerged from yesterdays vote smelling of roses, the source admitted.        
	It was decided that while the central leaders would continue seeking Bharadwajs recall, the Karnataka BJP would be restrained. Asked if he would demand the sack for the governor, Yeddyurappa said: We will think about it later.        
	The BJPs central leaders plan to meet the Prime Minister tomorrow to protest the venom poured on us by Bharadwaj, M. Venkaiah Naidu said.        
	The Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) have packed their legislators off to safe houses outside Bangalore ahead of the second trust vote.

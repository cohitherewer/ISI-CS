The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | KD Singh gets Ajsu backing
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                KD Singh gets Ajsu backing
  - Chandigarh tycoon only 3 votes short of Rajya Sabha seat          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                     
	Ranchi, June 7: Chandigarh-based tycoon and Alchemist Group chairman Kanwar Deep Singh, the JMM nominee for the Rajya Sabha biennial elections, today was assured of Ajsu support to ensure his victory on a day Congress and BJP nominees Dheeraj Prasad Sahu and Ajay Maroo officially threw their hats into the ring.        
	Singh today filed the second set of papers, proposed by four Ajsu MLAs  Chandra Prakash Chaudhary, Umakant Rajak, Kamal Kishore Bhagat and Ramchandra Sahis  besides six from the JMM, just 15 minutes before the deadline for the nominations ended. He had filed his first set of papers on Saturday proposed by JMM legislators only.         
	Though Singhs move should not trouble the Congress nominee, the Ajsus stand more or less sealed the fate of the BJP, which is still smarting from the embarrassment it suffered while trying to form a government in the state with JMM support.        
	The Congress-JVM has 25 MLAs in the 81-member House. We will easily manage three and even more votes to reach the victory post of 28, Singh told The Telegraph today.        
	The Assembly with 81 seats is divided into three blocks  Congress-JVM (25), JMM-Ajsu-Independents (25) and BJP-JD(U) (20).         
	It requires the support of 28 MLAs to elect a member to the Rajya Sabha.        
	BJP national general secretary Arjun Munda and state chief Raghubar Das, who were present at the time Maroo filed his papers, claimed the party nominee would get through, but their body language said otherwise.         
	Das said the BJP was making a fervent appeal to all MLAs to cast their vote based on conscience and not allurement.

	Singh, who runs a chain of hospitals, hotels and resorts in the country and an aviation school in Jamshedpur, has thus 25 MLAs, including two Independents  Chamra Linda and Videsh Singh  in his kitty. He is now short of only three votes.        
	The BJP was banking on the five-member Ajsu stepping out of the coalition with the JMM in the last minute, in the wake of Shibu Soren facing the charge of promoting horse-trading by fielding an outsider.         
	However, it was not to be. Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto scurried for cover after extending support to an outsider. Singh is not our choice. Rather we dont know him. But we have decided to support him keeping in view the coalition dharma, he said by way of explanation.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Mahto said he knew that supporting Singh would dent his partys image. However, the coalition with the JMM would fetch him rich dividends in the long run. We will try to maintain the alliance during the elections, he said.        
	According to sources, the Ajsu chief also wanted to teach a lesson to big brother BJP. The Ajsu, as an NDA ally, always supported BJP nominees during the Rajya Sabha elections. But the saffron brigade never took us on board while taking vital decisions, said a Ajsu leader, requesting anonymity.        
	Maroos candidature was proposed by Kunti Singh, Menaka Sardar, Laxman Gilua, Raghubar Das, Gurucharan Nayak, Harekrishna Singh, C.P. Singh, Amit Kumar Yadav, Neelkanth Singh Munda and Ramchandra Baitha.         
	The Congress nominee filed two sets of papers. JVM legislature party leader Pradeep Yadav was present along with senior Congress leaders Pradeep Balmuchu and Rajendra Prasad Singh during the process.        
	Meanwhile, nobody was ready to buy Mahtos defence. The Ajsu-JMM front has been formed solely keeping in view the RS polls. They will fall apart soon, said a senior JVM leader.        
	The BJP, which was earlier reluctant to field its candidate, was emboldened as relations soured between the JVM and Congress. BJP leader Sushma Swaraj even rang up Marandi seeking his support for the party nominee. Now, it will be listed as yet another failure of party chief Nitin Gadkari if Maroo fails to get through, said a senior BJP leader.        
	The two Rajya Sabha seats from the state fell vacant after the term of Dheeraj Prasad Sahu ended on May 30 and Hemant Soren quit after getting elected to the Assembly.         
	The RJD with five members is yet to reveal its cards. Besides, the votes of Independents, including Anosh Ekka, Hari Narayan Rai, and Geeta Koda are still open.

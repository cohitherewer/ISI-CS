          G.C. SHEKHAR              UNDER THE TREE                  An application form that mentions recomantation railway minister. (Above) A crowd lines up under a tree to collect the forms                                 
	Chennai, Aug. 3: Mamata Banerjee, look whats been happening in the south while you were stuck in the east.        
	There, all it requires is a table and a chair under a tree, a railway union with the Trinamul Congress name tag, and an application form printed in horrible English  and you have the makings of another rail job caper, with the minister made an unwitting party to it.        
	For the past few days, some people claiming to be office-bearers of the Southern Railway Trinamool Congress Employees Union have been selling and collecting what they claim to be application forms for the post of gatekeepers at level crossings.        
	Sitting under a tree opposite the railway hospital near the Golden Rock Railway Workshop at Tiruchy, they have been doing brisk business, charging Rs 25 for each form and collecting them for future processing.        
	We were assured that since the union belonged to Mamata Banerjees party, its recommendation would have more weight and we would easily get the jobs, said A. Krishnamoorthi from the neighbouring Ariyalur district as he filled out the form yesterday.        
	Asked how he came to know about the distribution of application forms, he said that during the past one week, loudspeaker-fitted vans had been making the announcement and distributing handbills in villages in Ariyalur.        
	A railway official in Tiruchy confirmed that only villagers around Tiruchy, about 350km from Chennai, had been targeted. All railway recruitment is made by the Railway Recruitment Board. The unions, even the registered ones, have no role in recruitment, he said.         
	In Calcutta, Trinamul leaders denied knowledge of any such union. I have not heard of any such organisation, said Madan Mitra, who oversees all the partys railway unions.        
	In Tiruchy, a man who introduced himself as P. Ganesan and said he was secretary of the Southern Railway Trinamool Congress Employees Union, claimed to be merely helping the wards of railway employees to get the jobs.        
	Since Mamataji has announced that 30,000 gatekeepers would be recruited for unmanned level crossings and also to fill the 13,000 current vacancies, we are making people aware of these vacancies, he said.        
	The application forms are just a kind of recommendation (recomantation, according to the form) that the union would forward to the railway minister, he said. Even the Rs 25 we are charging is to scan and send the applications by CD to the railway ministry.        
	Ganesan denied that the exercise was a job racket and alleged that the two recognised unions  the Southern Railway Mazdoor Union and the Dakshin Railway Mazdoor Union  had started a smear campaign since many railway employees were joining his union.        
	He admitted his union was not a recognised one but said it would soon earn recognition by meeting all the requirements, including a minimum membership of 500. We have only about 100 members now.        
	Ganesan said he had collected forms and money from 2,000 people in February and another 400 people in the past one week. Asked if any of the applicants had got the job, he replied that such things took time but asserted that they would get the promised jobs without any extra payment.        
	Asked if the railway minister knew of the unions activities, he said: She is too busy with her official work and political work to know each and every detail of what we do. But shell appreciate the social work we are doing since we are only simplifying the task of recruiting gatekeepers.        
	But today, Ganesan and his group were not seen under that tree as the railways vigilance department got interested in their activities.         
	Rajakili, the Tamil Nadu Trinamul president, was not available for comment.        
	Yes, Tamil Nadu has a Trinamul, although Mamata has not visited the state since she became railway minister last year. The birth of such party units in Tamil Nadu usually coincides with the rise in the clout of their parents in Delhi  when Lalu Prasad was railway minister, some enthusiasts had floated an RJD unit in the southern state.

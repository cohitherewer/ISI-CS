The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sachin enjoys, so does India
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Sachin enjoys, so does India
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      The Head...             ... and the hand: Tendulkar raises his bat after the double century. (Reuters)                          
	Colombo, July 29: The Sinhalese Sports Club wicket wont ever be the best promotional for Test cricket, but there can be no better advertisement for the oldest form of the sport than one Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.        
	In fact, for cricket itself.         
	At a time when cricketers are being judged through the T20 lens, the 37-year-old produced a masterly 203, batting for almost nine hours, to pull India out of an exceedingly tight corner.        
	The senior-most pro, incidentally, became the oldest Indian in over half-a-century to register a double. Vinoo Mankad, then in his 39th year, scored two double hundreds in 1955-56. Sourav Ganguly, at 35-plus, had one in 2007-08.         
	Sachin took guard shortly before lunch yesterday, Day III of the second Test, and got out in the final session this afternoon. It was the mega effort India required.        
	By then, the follow-on had been avoided and India were on track to overhaul Sri Lankas 642 for four declared. At stumps, that had been achieved, with India 669 for nine.        
	The hosts have a 1-0 lead in the Micromax Cup, but the visitors now have the chance to keep intact their No.1 ranking in Tests.              
	In a manner befitting an elder statesman, Sachin chose to talk more about young Suresh Raina, the centurion (120) on debut, than about his own fifth double hundred, the first in close to six years.        
	As he keeps enjoying his cricket, theres so much to learn from him, even off the field.         
	Raina showed tremendous character and produced a terrific all-round game. He was solid in defence, played magnificent shots. He came in to bat at a tricky time (241 for four), but went on to produce a remarkable innings. It didnt appear that he was playing his first Test...         
	Many guys doubted whether Raina would be a good Test player, but he proved he is one. Having already played 98 ODIs was helpful. Id asked him to enjoy himself. Told him (this morning) that a hundred on Test debut would always remain special. Im very happy for him, Sachin said.        
	Their 256-run partnership for the fifth-wicket proved the most prickly thorn for Sri Lanka and, hopefully, sooner rather than later, the futility of preparing such bland wickets would dawn on Sri Lanka Cricket.        
	Its the best in the world, from a batsmans point of view, a batsmans paradise. But, yes, there wasnt enough in it for the bowlers. It has been tough on them, is how Sachin put it.        
	What he didnt add was that the flattest surfaces also challenge. That one requires enormous patience and the shot selection becomes as important.         
	Getting back to Sachin, he told The Telegraph: Viru (Virender Sehwag) is right when he says that I have the hunger of a debutant. Its this hunger which drives me, its an important part of my make-up.        
	Of course, yes, and the bowlers have been tearing their hair for two decades.         
	Sachins best remains 248 not out and, when someone asked what it took to bridge the gap between a double and a triple, Sachin replied: Id like to score as many as possible, its never too late. However, its not the end of the world and there are other things to do (than getting a triple hundred).        
	Well, hes touchy about a few things.         
	The champion isnt getting any younger, yet the year has seen four hundreds and a double in Tests and an awesome 200 not out in the Gwalior ODI against South Africa.        
	Last evening, having been around for hours in energy-sapping conditions, Sachin had a long ice bath and, then, retired early. Its this discipline which puts him in an exclusive league.         
	With age, your thought process changes. Youre more experienced and have had more exposure. You know more about the game, but the process of learning never stops. I dont count the runs, Im just enjoying myself, Sachin explained.        
	So are we. Play on.        
	Footnote: According to a member of the team management, Sachin is available for the forthcoming tri-series in Sri Lanka. Hed skipped last months Asia Cup.

	Ranchi, May 16: BJP national general secretary Arjun Munda today arrived in the state capital to initiate dialogue with the JMM for transfer of the chief ministers chair to his party.         
	However, he had to face an embarrassing situation when chief minister Shibu Soren refused to meet him initially. Munda, tipped to be the BJPs chief minister, left Sorens residence late in the afternoon after speaking to the chief ministers son Hemant for half-an-hour.         
	Later in the evening, Soren met Munda for about 50 minutes and discussed the government formation formula. Hemant later said the talks were formal and veered around forming a stable government in the state.         
	Soon after his arrival in Ranchi to a grand welcome by party cadres, Munda said he would discuss the issue of forming a stable BJP-led government with the JMM and Ajsu, adding that he hoped the imbroglio would be resolved soon.        
	He said while his party leadership had not set a deadline, they wanted to settle the issue amicably as soon as possible.        
	A large number of BJP members, including ministers Baidyanath Ram and Barkuanr Gagrai were present at the airport. Gagrai said he hoped that an alternative government would soon be in place under Mundas leadership.        
	When asked about his visit to the Soren residence, Munda said it was a courtesy call. The real exercise for government formation will be taken up by organisational secretary Saudan Singh and Jharkhand in-charge Karuna Shukla, he told The Telegraph. Both leaders arrived here late in the evening.        
	According to sources, Munda will first work out the broad concept of the power transfer to the BJP and other issues like portfolio allocation would be decided later on.        
	Meanwhile, sources said Soren had assured the JMM core committee yesterday that he would take the final call tomorrow (Monday).        
	HRD minister and key negotiator Hemlal Murmu said party leaders and MLAs were relaxed after authorising Guruji to take a decision. In fact, several MLAs, including Haji Hussain Ansari, Mathura Mahto and Hemant attended a small party at Murmus residence.         
	According to JMM insiders, there were only two options before Soren now. Either he could quit and pave the way for the BJP to form the government and remain in the NDA, or he jumped to the UPA bandwagon, with the condition that the Congress accepted him as chief minister.         
	However, it was unlikely that the Congress and its ally JVM would accept Guruji as chief minister. So, the first option is likely to work, said a member of the JMM core committee.        
	Murmu said the JMM has been with the BJP for the last over four months and has kept the channels of communication open during the political crisis. We will have to begin from a scratch if we switch sides and join the UPA bandwagon, he maintained.

	Seoul, Nov. 27: North Korea accused South Korea today of using civilians as human shields around military bases on an island that the North hit with an artillery attack this week.         
	The accusation is an apparent effort to quell South Korean outrage over the barrage, which killed two civilian construction workers.        
	The Norths state-run Korean Central News Agency also issued new warnings about joint US-South Korea naval exercises in the Yellow Sea off North Korea, which will include an American aircraft carrier.        
	If the US brings its carrier to the West Sea of Korea at last, no one can predict the ensuing consequences, the report said, using the Korean name for the Yellow Sea.        
	The drills, which begin on Sunday, have angered both North Korea and its protector, China, stirring intense speculation in South Korean media of whether the North will respond violently.        
	Today, South Koreas Prime Minister and other dignitaries gathered to attend a large funeral for two South Korean marines who were also killed in the attack on Yeonpyeong Island. The commander of South Koreas marines, Lt. Gen. Yoo Nak-joon, vowed to revenge the deaths one thousand-fold.        
	We will put our feelings of rage and animosity in our bones and take our revenge on North Korea, he said.        
	South Korean public anger has also lashed out at President Lee Myung-bak for what many here see as the militarys failure to make more than a token response to Tuesdays attack. While the North fired some 180 shells during its hour-long fusillade, Yeonpyeong Islands marine garrison only shot back with 80 shells, according to the local media.        
	Today, there were at least two protests in Seoul that criticised both North Korean leader Kim Jong-il for the attack and President Lee for his weak response.        
	The KCNA report said South Korea should be held responsible for the civilian deaths because it had used civilians as human shields around its artillery batteries. The South is now working hard to dramatise the civilian casualties as part of its propaganda campaign, the report said.        
	The construction workers who died were painting buildings on a marine base when it was struck by North Korean artillery rounds, according to their co-workers. Yeonpyeong Island is dotted with concrete gun emplacements and fortified bases but also has a small fishing town that was populated before the 1950-53 Korean War.        
	The bombardment destroyed several parts of the town, levelling homes and sending panicked residents fleeing into bomb shelters, residents said. It was the first attack on a civilian area since the Korean War, and enraged the South Korean far more than previous provocations by the North, including its nuclear weapons tests and the sinking in March of a South Korean warship that killed 46 sailors.        
	The North has said that Tuesdays attack was made in response to South Korean artillery drills earlier that same day on the island, which sits within sight of the North Korean mainland. On the morning of the attack, North Korea warned South Korea not to conduct the drills, which would involve disputed waters claimed by both Koreas.        
	Citing those warnings, North Korea said it had made superhuman efforts to prevent the clash at the last moment. It also offered an uncharacteristic show of remorse, calling civilian deaths very regrettable.        
	The comments were apparently an attempt to present the Norths view of events to the enraged South Korean public, which has reacted to Tuesdays attack with uncharacteristic vehemence toward the North.         
	While South Koreans seemed to respond to past provocations with an air of resignation, this time there have been loud calls here for stronger military retaliation or a permanent end to all aid to the North. Much of that aid was cut off following the sinking of the Cheonan, but last month North Korea asked the South for food and other assistance following deadly floods.

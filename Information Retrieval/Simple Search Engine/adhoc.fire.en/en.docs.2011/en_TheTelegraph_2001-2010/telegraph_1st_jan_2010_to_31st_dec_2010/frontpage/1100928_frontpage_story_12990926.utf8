The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tenure over, envoy continues Tagore tryst
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tenure over, envoy continues Tagore tryst
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                            Mao Siwei reads Tagores complete works in Chinese. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                        
	Twenty-four thick and short volumes squat on the racks of the Chinese consulate in Salt Lake. Pick any one and leaf through the pages. To the average Calcuttan, the Chinese letters will be all Greek. Till one looks at the cover where in golden letters is inscribed in Bengali the name of our greatest philosopher-poet.        
	Mao Siwei smiles fondly at the books. Yes, these are the complete works of Tagore. A Chinese publisher brought this out on his 140th birth anniversary. It costs 890 Yuan, which is equivalent to Rs 6,000-plus.        
	The first Chinese consul-general in Calcutta since 1962, who ends his tenure in the city this month, claims that among all languages outside India his mother-tongue has done the most for popularising Tagore.        
	Every educated Chinese knows of Tagore. Last May, the Indian President unveiled his bust in Shanghai.        
	Siwei himself has done his bit too. His brainchild is a China gallery in Rabindra Bharati University. Three years ago, when the foreign minister of China was due here to open the consulate, he wanted to see Tagore House. When I went there to make the arrangements, I saw the Japan gallery and suggested to the vice-chancellor that there be one on Tagores link with China too. His visit in 1924 is important in our cultural history.        
	The result was a formal proposal to the minister and now a fund of Rs 53.6 lakh has been pledged by the China government for the section. The Tagore books will be gifted to the gallery.        
	Siweis only regret is not being able to attend the opening of the gallery on Tagores 150th birth anniversary next year. I will be posted in Macau then.        
	He brightens up on remembering that Calcutta will soon have another direct connection to China. An airline in south China is planning to start a Calcutta-Shenzhen flight from November. With this, India will have direct flights to every major Chinese city.        
	He is aware of the considerable Chinese presence on the pavements of the city.        
	When I see the Made in China products, I feel happy. But I really wish the traders here would invest in better quality imports and not just pick up the cheapest items.        
	Siwei is nearing retirement age. Once he hangs up his boots, he wants to return to India. Religious tourism has tremendous potential to attract people from China. The Chinese want to know more about the land of Buddha. Calcutta can be the gateway for them.        
	But the bottleneck is lack of guides with knowledge of Chinese language and culture. I want to set up a course to train guides to take Chinese tourists to Bodhgaya, Konark temple and through the fantastic collection at the Indian Museum here.

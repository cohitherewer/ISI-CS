The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Why this Cup missed soccer
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Why this Cup missed soccer
                                            
	The 2010 World Cup has been wonderful for the nation and population of South Africa.        
	This Mandela/Blatter project created:          
	 A tourism spending spike to stabilise the rand for the time being;  
	 An enforced deadline for the completion of new roads, bridges, airports and stadia;        
	 Employment and improved training of thousands more police and security personnel who made a difference on the streets;        
	 A string of local and pan-African youth and educational development programmes;         
	Generated a sense of national unity hitherto unknown between all the racial, linguistic and cultural groupings.        
	Good. So much for that.        
	But has the 2010 World Cup been wonderful for football? That is a totally different question. Many would say that football itself suffered because far too much emphasis was placed on the South African organisational effort and all the fringe issues.        
	Somewhere, somehow, Fifa took its eye off the football. This resulted in a mediocre tournament in terms of quality, and a dearth of superstar performances, great goals and great saves. No great matches, either.            A BETTER CONTEST: PAUL VS MANI
                  Paul, the lsquo;psychic rsquo; octopus, squeezes into a box   decorated with a Spanish flag and having a shell inside on Friday at the Sea Life aquarium in Oberhausen, western 
  Germany. Paul rsquo;s task was to decide in favour of one of the shells hidden in boxes with the flags of the Netherlands and Spain. Paul predicted Spain would win the World Cup. But Mani (above), a parakeet in   Singapore, picked the   Netherlands as the winner. (AFP pictures)      
	A modicum of drama was to be had: Uruguays cheat-assisted overturning of Ghana; South Africas victorious exit against France; Englands ghost goal. But these were isolated incidents created mostly by competition formula, not by football itself.        
	Fifa insiders, in private conversation, conceded their concern about the quality of the football but dared not say so in public. The truth is that the quality of the brand has diminished with every succeeding increase in the number of teams competing.        
	Quite simply, the expansion may mean more games and thus more commercial income but at the price of lower standards of fan fare.        
	I do not write as some outsider parachuted in to report the finals. I was there when South Africa campaigned for the World Cup; I was there when South Africa lost the World Cup and then when South Africa was awarded the World Cup; I was there for the original qualifying draw; I was there for the Confederations Cup; I was there for the finals draw; and I have spent significant time there in between.        
	I saw new stadia springing from muddy building site to glorious amphitheatre: the giraffe stadium in Nelspruit, Cape Towns politically contentious Greenpoint in the shadow of the Table Mountain, the ever-so-long-drawn-out Calabash creation which is Soccer City and my personal favourite, the magnificent Moses Mabhida in Durban which will one day  in my opinion  welcome the Olympic Games into Africa for the first time.        
	Now I have seen the closing of the African World Cup. It served many purposes. But now the World Cup needs to put football back at the epicentre.        
	Cut back on the political glad-handing; cut back on all the promotional receptions and, yes, the media conferences.        
	Get on with the game and think about the central issues to advance the football at this tarnished pinnacle: overhaul the over-intense match schedule and the insulting nonsense of a new ball right on top of the finals themselves. And yes, bring on as soon as possible the technological assistance which Fifa and Ifab  the body that determines the laws of the game  are finally having to confront, kicking and screaming.        
	Once again, the group stages produced some of the better football. In a reversal of yesteryear, the knockout stages generated lower-quality, fear-factor football.        
	This is not to discount or disparage the amount of effort put in by all the competing teams, their coaches and players. This was probably the most physically intense and fittest World Cup yet with results evidencing a levelling-up process across all the continents.        
	But truly memorable moments were few and far between, the most highly vaunted superstars  with the exception of Leo Messi  sank far beneath their reputations and the emergent talent, with Thomas Mueller leading the way, rose in part to fill a vacuum of popular and media demand.        
	The Jabulani ball did not help. South Africa was a complex place to take so many of the worlds finest players because the variety of altitudes and climate meant an inherent challenge to technique. The thinner air at altitude caused problems which the new ball exacerbated.        
	Next time around, Fifa should start any new ball in the qualifying competition. Its an insult to players and fans and the World Cup itself to enforce the introduction of a new ball right on top of the tournament.        
	Africas failure to provide more than a mere one team for the knockout stage was a major disappointment and the continental confederation could not really complain if it concedes a spot, for 2014, to Asia which produced two knockout qualifiers (Japan and South Korea) from a smaller, four-team base (and Australia fell short only on goal difference).        
	Tactically, developments were limited to detail. One of the reasons for the dearth of goals, down around the lowest rates for World Cups, was the preponderance of 4-2-3-1 tactical formations. It stands to sense that teams with only one full-time striker will not produce high-scoring entertaining football.        
	Increased fitness levels enhance the level of attacking support out of midfield but that can be only sporadic.        
	The tetchy, below-scale performances of Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and  most notably  Wayne Rooney were a major disappointment. Its no excuse to blame over-expectation or a stressful European season or the draining weight of responsibility which now attaches to Champions League competition.        
	Those factors were not a hindrance, for example, to Arjen Robben, Mark van Bommel, Wesley Sneijder or the stars of Barcelona. Its just that they demonstrated superior character and willpower.        
	That is why they will compete in the World Cup final and why the likes of Kaka, Ronaldo and Rooney have been relegated to the bargain basement along with the little mascot Zakumi and all the cut-price, left-over merchandising.

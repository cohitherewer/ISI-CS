	London, Feb. 26: One does not know whether Britains Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who used to be Chancellor of the Exchequer under Tony Blair, has followed finance minister Pranab Mukherjees budget today.        
	But if he has, he will be a relieved man. India, which is being touted as a success story in the face of worldwide recession, is doing exactly as Brown has said Labour would do to repair the faltering British economy, which after shrinking for three quarters emerged with a 0.3 per cent GDP growth in the quarter ended December 2009.        
	India managed to tide over the global economic crisis better than most countries and thus tends to be a role model for many, points out Prof Christopher J. Green of Loughborough University.         
	Mukherjee has staggered rollback of tax cuts, retaining some of the tax cuts while dispensing with others. He has also chosen to not really cut expenses.         
	And most importantly, from the British point of view, talked of recapitalising banks. Browns Labour Party, slated to lock horns in an electoral battle for the control of the House of Commons with the Conservatives this summer, also wants to cut the deficit in a staggered manner, while keeping total public spending static in real terms from 2011-15.         
	We are coming through recession. We are moving forward to recovery. But it is absolutely essential for us to retain support for the economy. To remove it now as the Tories are suggesting would be absolute madness, UK chancellor Alistair Darling said today in an interview to BBC television, soon after the revised fourth-quarter GDP growth figures were announced.         
	The Indian finance ministers promise of a $3.5-4 billion capital infusion for state run banks to shore up their capital is of course peanuts compared to what the British taxpayer will have to bear to bail out failed banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland.         
	The bill for the costliest bank bailout package in UK history is a cool 850 billion. The commitments include buying 76 billion of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group; indemnifying the Bank of England against losses incurred in providing more than 200 billion of liquidity support; guaranteeing up to 250 billion of wholesale borrowing by banks to strengthen liquidity; providing 40 billion of loans and other funding to Bradford amp; Bingley and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme; and insurance cover of over 280bn for bank assets.         
	The bank bailouts and shoring up of capital are however not what is worrying Brown and other global economy managers.        
	It is the need to cut fiscal deficits and yet keep the economy ticking. Britain has just managed to pass out of recession by a whisker.                          
	 Sir Richard Jolly, a distinguished development economist and honorary professor at the University of Sussex, said earlier economists never bothered about fiscal deficit or the size of the national debt. However, in recent years, nations have started worrying about fiscal deficit and debt because of the drain they cause on debt servicing flows and on inflation. Debt overruns have placed at least three southern European nations in near bankrupt state  Greece, Portugal and Spain. Greece with a debt of 120 per cent of its GDP is being bailed out by stronger European neighbours. But cutting down public spending, which saw economies around the world recover and increasing taxes to cut deficits, or the difference between earnings and spending, could mean world recovery may well be compromised. German economy shrunk a record 5 per cent and ran up a record euro 100 billion debt in 2009, UKs by 4.5 per cent, France by a more modest 2.2 per cent. Many feel tried and tested Keynesian theories of spending their way out of trouble should not be totally sacrificed at the altar of fiscal prudence. Green said: Theres certainly pressure on major indebted countries to rollback the stimulus. The US has began by raising the discount rate from its 0.5 per cent floor. The difficulty is that if this stops the recovery then tax revenues will fall back and it will only exacerbate the deficit position. In a sense, Mukherjee as also Gordon Brown are both wedged between a hard rock and the sea. They both have to cut deficit to stay afloat but cant totally cut stimulus for fear the economy will stifle.         
	After all without stimulus measures, domestic demand may falter, and that is what is sustaining most economies now as global trade between nations has yet to pick up, having shrunk a massive 12 per cent through 2009.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bombers blemish African joy   Blasts kill 80 soccer fans   in Uganda 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bombers blemish African joy
   Blasts kill 80 soccer fans   in Uganda           AMIT ROY                                                      
	London, July 12: The ultimate celebration of football ended in carnage last night as nearly 80 people watching the World Cup final were killed in Uganda in co-ordinated bombings by an al Qaida-linked militia that opposes sports, music and dancing.        
	Officials said among the dead were at least one person of Indian descent, an American citizen and an Irish woman.        
	They added that the casualties could include more Indians but the Indian embassy said it did not know of any victims from the country till this evening.        
	Uganda, which many Indians had considered the pearl of Africa until they were expelled by Idi Amin in 1972, still has around 15,000 to 17,000 people of Indian origin.        
	Right now the official figure is 74 dead. There is a white woman, one person of Indian descent, 10 Ethiopians, Uganda government spokesperson Fred Opolot said in the afternoon.        
	The Shabab, Somalias most feared insurgent group, has claimed responsibility for the bombings in Kampala, Ugandas capital. The Shabab has been waging a relentless insurgency against Somalias weak transitional federal government, and it has repeatedly threatened Uganda and Burundi for contributing troops to the African Unions effort to stabilise the country.        
	The bombings  in a popular Ethiopian garden restaurant and a rugby club stamped a brutal blemish on Africas joy at having hosted the continents first soccer World Cup.        
	These bombs were definitely targeting World Cup crowds, Kampala police chief Kale Kayihura said.        
	Fifa president Sepp Blatter said in Johannesburg in response to a question: Can you link it to the World Cup? I dont know. Naturally, it was at a moment when the World Cup was on television but has this something to do with football or not? This is not ours to investigate. I am very sad.         
	Some 2,000 Ugandans and foreign tourists had packed into the Lugogo Rugby Club in Kampala last night to watch the final between Spain and the Netherlands on a giant screen.         
	I have just come from the rugby club which has been sealed off by police, Sanjeev Patel, who is on the executive committee of the club and is also a senior member of the Indian Association of Uganda, told The Telegraph over the phone. We believe that 80 people have died. The bodies have been moved to mortuaries.        
	We have a good information network and we would have heard within 15 minutes if anyone in the community was missing. Initially, there were reports two Indians were among the victims but sometimes Ethiopians can look like Indians, Patel added.        
	Kampala is the most peaceful place, Patel said. My wife could come home alone with the driver at night.        
	The Shabab also has problems with Ethiopians, probably the reason for picking out the Ethiopian restaurant. Ethiopian troops invaded Somalia in 2006 to oust an Islamist movement from Mogadishu. That sparked an Islamist insurgency which still rages.        
	 At one of the scenes, investigators identified the severed head of a Somali national, who we suspect could have been a suicide bomber, an army spokesperson said.        
	US President Barack Obama said Washington was ready to help Uganda hunt down those responsible.       WITH NYTNS AND REUTERS INPUTS

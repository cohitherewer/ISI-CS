  - All clear, except 1 nomination           SANJAY K. JHA                            Sonia Gandhi after filing her nomination papers. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: When a stickler for detail like Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself drops in to file your nomination, what possibly can go wrong?         
	Nothing. But for an anonymous 10th one.        
	In keeping with the highest traditions of the Grand Old Party of India, a person from Chandigarh forgot to sign one of the 56 sets of nominations filed to facilitate the election of Sonia Gandhi as Congress president for a record fourth term tomorrow.        
	The fact that one of the 56 nominations was rejected because of the oversight provided a statistical nugget to an election whose result is a foregone conclusion.        
	The errant nomination was filed from Chandigarh. The paper was declared invalid because it had signatures of nine, not the prescribed 10, delegates.        
	Unless the 10th one succumbs to the urge of adventure and reveals the identity or in-house rivals leak the name of the delegate who forgot to sign Sonias nomination, the source of one of the most amnesiac acts in recent political history will remain an enduring mystery.         
	Otherwise, every little detail has been worked out for the election tomorrow.         
	Sonias Special Protection Group (SPG) officers landed at the Congress headquarters on 24 Akbar Road today, like they do ahead of her poll rallies, but this is one election where she isnt canvassing.        
	She will come only after the polls are over tomorrow  to collect the certificate saying she has been elected Congress chief.        
	Senior leaders were in a huddle this evening to prepare a foolproof plan to ensure tomorrows programme passes off without a glitch. Issues such as the guest list, who will say what and whether Sonia should interact with the media were being discussed.        
	The Prime Minister drove down to the party office to file one of her nominations. So did the veteran Pranab Mukherjee and other cabinet ministers, general secretaries, chief ministers and state party chiefs.        
	While Manmohan led one group of cabinet ministers to file the first set, finance minister Mukherjee headed the second. He was followed by Motilal Vora, whose band comprised general secretaries, including Rahul Gandhi.        
	While most state units filed two sets of papers, Sonias home state of Uttar Pradesh took the lead with four. Asked if this was a charade of democracy as nobody was expected to contest against her, a young minister quipped: No, it is a celebration of democracy where the supreme leader faces no threats, no conspiracies, no betrayals.         
	The partys election authority head Oscar Fernandes also rejected suggestions the process was a sham. Every Congressman was free to contest. If all of them support her, there can be no contest, Fernandes asserted.        
	Partys chief spokesman Janardan Dwivedi reacted sharply to the BJPs criticism that while Sonia was set to be elected for the fourth term, there was a two-term cap on district and state presidents of the Congress.        
	Char nahi, chaalis bar rakhenge (Not four, forty times she will be made party chief). The partys constitution allows this, democracy allows this. The BJP should not forget that Nehru was kept Prime Minister by this country for so many terms while many could not complete one term, Dwivedi said.        
	Fernandes said the Congress was following its constitution and reminded the BJP that it should stick to its own. He said as only one candidate  Sonia herself  was in the fray, the result would be declared tomorrow itself. But the schedule for the election of state party presidents on September 17 would remain unchanged.

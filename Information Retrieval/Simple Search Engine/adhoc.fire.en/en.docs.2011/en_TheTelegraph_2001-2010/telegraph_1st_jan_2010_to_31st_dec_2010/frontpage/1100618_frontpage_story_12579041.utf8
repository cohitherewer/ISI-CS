          OUR BUREAU                                              
	June 17: The CBI today announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh each for information leading to the arrest of three members of a Maoist-backed resistance group alleged to have been behind the Jnaneswari Express sabotage.        
	The agency said the information on Bapi Mahato, Umakanta Mahato and Asit Mahato of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCPA) can be given round the clock at 9674433351, 9051444405, 9051061000 and 033-23596119.        
	Posters announcing the bounty will also be put up in villages near the site of the accident in Bengals West Midnapore.        
	We are sure the accused are in the villages. They are being sheltered by a section of the villagers. We hope the people of the area inhabited by poor tribals will come forward, at least for the reward, said a CBI officer.        
	The announcement of the reward came alongside the formation of a joint investigation team (JIT) by the CBI on the May 28 tragedy that killed 150 people.         
	The JIT comprises three officers each of the CBI and Bengal police, two of the Railway Protection Force, one of the Railway Board and two forensic experts. CBI joint director Keshav Kumar, camping in Bengal for the past few days with other colleagues to probe the crash, will head the JIT.        
	Three arrests have been made so far but the sleuths have failed to track down the leaders of the Maoist-backed PCPA who supervised the track sabotage. The rebels have denied responsibility. Bengal police, who carried out the initial probe, insisted the PCPA was involved.

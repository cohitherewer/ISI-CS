          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Rescuers at the accident site. (Telegraph picture)                                  
	Ranchi, Jan. 14: A fatal cocktail of bad roads and brake failure left 31 labourers dead and 17 injured in the Bhagwan Valley area on Bhavnathpur-Ketar Road in Garhwa district this afternoon.        
	The dead included 10 children and eight women who were part of a group of 50 labourers who were on their way from Saina village in Bihars Rohtas district to Kupa village in Garhwa on a truck that was loaded with 100 bags of paddy as well.         
	According to the police, while negotiating a steep curve, about 12km away from Kupa, the truck first skidded on loose stone chips on the road. As the driver tried to control the over-loaded vehicle, the brakes failed and the truck hurtled down a 15-feet-deep ditch. The driver and his assistant survived the accident by jumping off in the nick of time, but the others were not so lucky.        
	The accident spot is about 265km from the state capital under Bhavnathpur police station area of Garhwa district.         
	Chief minister Shibu Soren announced Rs 1 lakh ex gratia for the families of the deceased and said the state would bear the medical expenses of the injured. He also directed the district administration to take steps to prevent such accidents in the future.        
	Sources said the deceased were from Kupa, Melwan and Secharia, three villages in the district, and were returning after harvesting crops in the neighbouring state. Ten of the deceased were from the same family.        
	Soon after the accident, a 5000-strong mob led by local MLA Anant Pratap Dev demonstrated at the spot, demanding compensation of Rs 5 lakh, a government job and a house to the kin of each deceased. They did not allow the district administration to remove the bodies till late in the evening.        
	State police spokesperson and IG, human rights, V.H. Deshmukh said the truck turned turtle and fell off the road.

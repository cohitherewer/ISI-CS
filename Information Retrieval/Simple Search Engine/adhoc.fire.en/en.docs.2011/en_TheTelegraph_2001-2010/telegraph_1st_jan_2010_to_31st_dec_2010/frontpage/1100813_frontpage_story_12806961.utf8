The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Antibiotic abuse clue to superbug
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Antibiotic abuse clue to superbug
          OUR BUREAU                       Karthikeyan Kuamaraswamy                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: India appears to be a hotspot for a new class of multidrug resistant bacteria, sections of microbiologists have said, challenging the Indian health ministrys attempts to play down implications of the discovery.        
	An international research team had reported yesterday that certain bacteria that can spread through contaminated water or food have become multidrug resistant through an enzyme labelled New Delhi metallo beta-lactamase-1, or NDM1.        
	Scientists first detected this class of bacteria two years ago in a 59-year-old man in Sweden who had just returned from India and was ill. Since then, doctors have found similar bacteria  resistant to most known antibiotics  from 44 patients in Chennai, 26 in Haryana, 73 from other sites in India, and 37 in the UK, most of whom had a history of travel to India.         
	The patterns prompted the team, which included microbiologists from India, to suggest in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases that India may export this frightening form of drug resistance to other countries through its medical tourism industry.        
	The health ministry today responded saying that this suggestion is loaded with inferences that the resistance possibly originated in India and it may not be safe for foreign patients to opt for treatment in this country.         
	These inferences are not based on science, said Vishva Mohan Katoch, director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research. The resistance seen in these organisms called plasmid resistance is a natural phenomenon that routinely occurs in nature. Becoming infected with such a bacteria is a matter of chance which can be prevented through sound infection prevention strategies, he said.        
	But microbiologists who discovered this resistance and others not associated with the new study have pointed out that the widespread abuse of antibiotics in India promotes the emergence of resistance.        
	Indian doctors had themselves flagged NDM1 emergence in India four months ago. Doctors from the Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai, had reported in the Journal of the Association of Physicians of India that in a short span of three months, they had identified 22 such organisms.        
	(The) Indian medical community needs to be ashamed of the NDM1 gene, an editorial titled Obituary  the death of antibiotics in the same issue of the journal had said, in a critique of antibiotic abuse in the country.        
	Microbiologists in India have warned for years that irrational prescriptions and over-the-counter sales of antibiotics in India can spawn resistant microbes. But today, even study authors appeared to forget bad medical practices and ready to defend Indias image.        
	The superbug claimed to be found in patients treated in Indian hospitals could be prevalent elsewhere in the world as well, the lead researcher of the paper, Karthikeyan Kuamaraswamy, a PhD student in microbiology at Chennais Institute of Basic Medical Sciences of the University of Madras, said.        
	 He said the alarmist interpretation of the findings was unfortunate and unfounded.                 
	His guide Padma Krishnan pointed out that while the published version of the research paper had been vetted by Karthikeyan and his team, she never expected the research to be taken out of context to sully the reputation of the Indian medical sector.        
	That definitely was not the aim of Karthikeyans research, she asserted.        
	Indias health ministry has also questioned the name assigned to the resistance enzyme.        
	But Timothy Walsh, medical microbiologist at Cardiff University and corresponding author of the study said there was nothing nasty about the process of assigning the name New Delhi to the enzyme.        
	In naming the gene, Walsh said, the research team only followed a tradition among microbiologists to use the name of the city where it is believed to have emerged first. There are similar genetic elements that confer resistance named after Verona (Italy), Sao Paulo (Brazil), or Adelaide (Australia), Walsh told The Telegraph. This was isolated in Sweden, but Sweden did not have this type of (carbapenem-resistance) resistance at all, and the patient had just returned from New Delhi, he said.        
	But some microbiologists say expanded surveillance may reveal the bugs in more countries. We already know at least a few patients who did not have travel history to India also had this resistant bacteria, said Belagoude Harish, a microbiologist at Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Pondicherry.        
	 But even Harish concedes India needs to tighten controls on antibiotic practices. The widespread abuse of antibiotics can contribute to such resistance  the plasmid bearing bacteria will be selected under antibiotic pressure, he told The Telegraph.        
	 It is a sorry state of affairs today, Harish said.

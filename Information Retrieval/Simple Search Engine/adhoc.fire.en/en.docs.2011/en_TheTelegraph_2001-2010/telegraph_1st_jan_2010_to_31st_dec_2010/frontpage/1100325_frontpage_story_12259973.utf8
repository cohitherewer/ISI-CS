          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, March 24: Stephen Courts caretaker and his assistant have been arrested and police are looking for at least two co-owners of the building.        
	They have been slapped with charges that carry as punishment no more than 10 years in jail.         
	Tarun Bagaria, 38, the manager and caretaker, and Ram Shankar Singh, 62, were arrested after the fire services department lodged an FIR with the Shakespeare Sarani police station this afternoon against the owners who hold the possession of the building.        
	Both were picked up from Taruns NSC Bose Road office. Ram Shankar is a pump operator born in Stephen Court and has been employed there for the past 35 years.        
	We are also looking for Sanjay Bagaria and Shiv Prasad Bagaria, who are believed to be the co-owners of the building. They are absconding. The exact ownership pattern of the building is hazy till now. But we expect to get more details from the arrested duo, said a police officer.         
	Tarun and Ram Shankar lived at Stephen Court. When the fire broke out, the keys to the terrace were reportedly with Tarun and the doors were locked.        
	A case has been drawn up under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 285 (negligent conduct with regard to fire) and a clutch of sections that deal with fire clearance procedures for highrises.

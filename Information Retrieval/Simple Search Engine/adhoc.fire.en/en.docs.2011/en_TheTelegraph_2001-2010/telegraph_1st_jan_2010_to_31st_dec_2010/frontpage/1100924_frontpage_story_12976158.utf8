The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Diabetes drug banned abroad, test for India

          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: Europe today banned and the US imposed severe restrictions on an anti-diabetes medicine called rosiglitazone amid concerns that it increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes, but doctors say the drug is widely used in India.         
	The European Medicines Agency (EMA) suspended marketing approval to the drug and said doctors should stop prescribing medicines that contain rosiglitazone. It asked patients on this medication to consult their doctors to discuss suitable alternatives.        
	The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said rosiglitazone would now be restricted to patients unable to control their diabetes with other drugs. The FDA is taking this action to protect patients after a careful effort to weigh benefits and risks, FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg said.         
	The announcements follow independent reviews by the EMA and the FDA of data showing elevated risks of heart failure and strokes associated with the drug.         
	But diabetes specialists believe the drug continues to be marketed aggressively in India.        
	The use of rosiglitazone in India is still widespread, mainly through general practitioners and doctors who are still not so well aware of its potential risks, said Anoop Misra, a consultant endocrinologist and director of the Centre for Diabetes and Obesity Studies in New Delhi.         
	Misra said most endocrinologists and senior physicians in large metros were not prescribing rosiglitazone any more because of greater awareness in medical circles and even among the public. But there is still aggressive marketing by pharma company representatives who try to influence junior doctors and general practitioners who are not in touch with recent research data, telling them that it is not harmful, Misra said.         
	Misra and other endocrinologists in India said they would now wait and watch Indian drug regulators response to the FDA and European decisions.         
	Under the new FDA restrictions, doctors in the US will now have to attest and document each patients eligibility to receive rosiglitazone. Such a rigorous follow-up and documentation would be impossible in India, a senior endocrinologist in Delhi said.        
	European regulators had earlier restricted the drug as a second-line medication, to be given only to patients in whom other drugs did not work. In view of the restrictions already in place, the EMA panel examining the issue has said it could not identify any additional measures that would reduce the cardiovascular risks of the drug.        
	The EMA panel said the benefits no longer outweigh the risks and suspended its market approval.         
	The FDA has also halted a controversial clinical trial that was to compare rosiglitazone with another anti-diabetes medication called pioglitazone. Several medical centres across India were to be part of this clinical trial, as The Telegraph had reported on May 29 this year.         
	Experts in India and North America had described the clinical trial as unethical, saying it was ignoring a wealth of data that suggested that rosiglitazone carried greater risk of harm than pioglitazone.        
	Both drugs provide effective blood glucose control. But over the past three years, studies had shown that rosiglitazone carries a higher risk of heart failure than pioglitazone.        
	A joint statement last year from the American Diabetes Association and the European Diabetes Association had advised against the use of rosiglitazone in the control of diabetes.

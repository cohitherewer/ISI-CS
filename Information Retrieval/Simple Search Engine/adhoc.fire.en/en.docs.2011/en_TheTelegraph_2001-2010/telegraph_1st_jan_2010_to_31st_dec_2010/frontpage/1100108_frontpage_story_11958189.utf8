  - Team sponsor in Goa for discussions after molestation slur           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, Jan. 7: The flight fracas could cost Churchill Brothers a few crores if the molestation charge against its team skipper is established.        
	Team sponsor Kunnath Pharmaceuticals has threatened to dump the Goa football club following the charges against Okolie Odafe, also the most valuable player on Indias league circuit.        
	The three-year deal between the club and the company, worth Rs 10 crore, was signed in September 2009.        
	Odafe, a Nigerian, and his team-mates, countryman Ogba Kalu and Indias goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya, were arrested on Tuesday night for allegedly molesting a SpiceJet airhostess on the first leg of a Goa-Mumbai-Calcutta flight.         
	The allegations have cast a shadow on the teams branding. Kunnath Pharmaceuticals manufactures ayurvedic medicines and food supplements  and is using its branded male-libido formulation called Musli Power Xtra to sponsor the Goa-based football club as well as their jersey.        
	Following the deal, Churchill Brothers has been officially christened Musli Power Churchill Brothers, with the players wearing co-branded jerseys.        
	Kunnath managing director, Kochi-based K.C. Abraham, is in two minds about continuing the sponsorship.        
	I will have no qualms about withdrawing their sponsorship if the molestation allegations against the team are true, said Abraham from Kochi just before he boarded a flight to Goa on Thursday to discuss the matter with the club-owners.        
	Late tonight, after a first round of meeting, Abraham told PTI in Goa: We have heard Churchill Alemao and now we will talk to SpiceJet management, the police and the girl to get to the bottom of the case. We will not form our opinion by media reports. We will satisfy ourselves.        
	Till the companys probe is over, the deal will stand. Before leaving for Goa, Abraham cited personal as well as business reasons for reviewing the sponsorship.         
	Ours is a company which is engaged in traditional products. Musli Power is a formulation based on the traditional herbal safed musli (a herbal aphrodisiac). It is being promoted as a desi viagra. Such incidents involving the skipper of a team we promote will show us in very poor light and is bad for our brand image, he said.        
	Plus, I have so many women working in our company. I also have three daughters who feel very strongly about the incident. Back home in Kerala, we have a value system where women are given the highest respect. Hence I am reaching Goa to get a complete account of what happened.         
	Abraham added: If it (the molestation allegation) is true, then there will be no association with the football team... if it is the other way round, then our association will continue.        
	Churchill Alemao, a former Goa chief minister and now a state vice-president of the Congress, has accused the air hostess, the wife of a naval officer, of lying and threatened to file a defamation suit against SpiceJet. However, Churchill Brothers has not yet filed any legal suit. The airline has sent a complaint and report to the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation about Tuesdays incident.        
	A political drama is also being played out over the incident. According to top police sources, the three footballers were handled with kid gloves and given bail following a call made by Union minister Sharad Pawar, considered close to Churchill Alemao, to Mumbai police chief D. Sivanandan.        
	Government sources in Maharashtra today said chief minister Ashok Chavan, whose government is in alliance with Pawars NCP, is keen that the three Churchill players are brought to book.

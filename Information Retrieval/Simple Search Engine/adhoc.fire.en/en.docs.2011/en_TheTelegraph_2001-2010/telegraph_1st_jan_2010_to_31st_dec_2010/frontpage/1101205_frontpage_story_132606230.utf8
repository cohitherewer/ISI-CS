                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Airlines lower overall fares
 							       
	New Delhi, Dec 5 (PTI): With pressure mounting on them, domestic airlines have lowered the overall fares on several sectors though they are yet to return to the average levels during the same period last year.
    The overall airfares have come down by about 20-25 per cent in the past week, official sources said, adding that the "pressure" mounted by the Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) against exorbitant airfares had been a success, officials told PTI here.
    The fare range on Delhi-Mumbai sector was Rs 5,000 to Rs 20,000 on economy class ticket, while that on Delhi-Chennai and Delhi-Kolkata stood between Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000, the officials said.
    Two weeks ago, the lowest last-minute Delhi-Mumbai fare was about Rs 17,000, even though holiday travel season had not begun.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Freedom from reading the leader
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Freedom from reading the leader
          SANJAY K. JHA                             Sonia Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee read a booklet on the first year of achievements of the UPA governments second stint. File picture                                   
	New Delhi, June 26: Congress foot soldiers can give their eyes a break. Most of them no longer need to subscribe to their party journal.        
	Only the big shots have to.        
	A quiet change has taken place within the party with the leadership realising that the organisations official mouthpiece Congress Sandesh had failed to serve the purpose of educating ordinary workers.        
	Result: the leadership has allowed ordinary members the freedom not to subscribe to the 32-page monthly, which costs Rs 10. A years subscription comes to Rs 100.        
	Initially, however, it was mandatory for every member to buy the magazine, though this clause was never complied with as barely a few lakh copies got printed.        
	If every Congress worker had subscribed to the mouthpiece since it was started in 1999, it would have been the worlds largest circulated periodical as the party has over 2.5 crore members.        
	Even now the party constitution says Every member shall pay subscription to the periodical and the subscription amount shall have to be deposited along with his/her enrolment/renewal form.        
	The party constitution also says that those who desire to become members but cannot afford to pay (the) subscription along with his/her enrolment fee are permitted to pay the same within one year after their enrolment as members.        
	This means every member has to buy the magazine.        
	But the next two sentences virtually exempt ordinary members from subscribing to the journal.        
	However, for the members who get elected to any of the committees, it shall be mandatory to enrol themselves as subscribers of the Congress periodical i.e. Congress Sandesh. In the case of elected representatives like MPs, MLAs, MLCs, panchayat raj members and all party functionaries at (the) block level and above subscribing to Congress Sandesh is compulsory.         
	Several members said the omission of the mandatory clause was a welcome move as the contents were mostly stale and the magazine had little to offer except for Sonia Gandhis letter, the editorial and lots of photographs.        
	An exception had been the recent article by Sonia that sought to bring about a balance between security operations and the need for development in Maoist-affected areas.        
	A member of the All India Congress Committee said the magazine had been reduced to a publicity machine of a few individuals.        
	Old speeches and interviews reproduced from newspapers and essays on irrelevant issues and mostly meant for personal projection do not interest us, added another AICC member. It would be better if Soniaji sends us a letter in plain paper on a monthly basis instead of spending so much on the magazine.        
	Senior leaders agreed that drastic measures were needed to tone up the content and added that party chief Sonia, too, was deeply concerned about the quality of the magazine and had voiced her displeasure several times.        
	Sonia had tried to improve the quality by drafting in a senior journalist, Pankaj Sharma, as associate editor. For a few months, the magazine showed some improvement, then it was back to square one.        
	Cosmetic measures wont help, said an AICC member. Soniaji will have to rebuild a fresh team. It was meant to convey to the ordinary workers the partys vision and the leaderships perspective on burning issues. It has been reduced to a publicity machine of three-four individuals crying for attention.        
	Apart from Sonias letter and the photographs, the magazines contents now include write-ups on history and historical personalities by editor Anil Shastri, editorial board member Sarvjit Singh, associate editors Ravni Thakur and Pankaj Sharma, and AICC secretary Praveen Davar.        
	Senior leaders from the party or incisive commentators are, however, not invited to write on important events. Guest writers are often picked on whims of the editors. Senior leaders described an article on Sonia as worse than a primary school essay. Sonia often meets the aam aadmi and mingles with them  this was the most significant sentence written by her, a Youth Congress leader said.         
	The Sandesh did have a powerful editorial board once, including senior leaders like Natwar Singh, Vasanth Sathe, Mani Shankar Aiyar, Girija Vyas and Salman Khursheed. Now the board has only two leaders as members, Khursheed and Sarvjit Singh.        
	Sources said Khursheed had stopped attending board meetings after becoming a minister. Now the Sandesh for party workers every month are lots of photographs, shoddy articles and speeches of Sonia and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

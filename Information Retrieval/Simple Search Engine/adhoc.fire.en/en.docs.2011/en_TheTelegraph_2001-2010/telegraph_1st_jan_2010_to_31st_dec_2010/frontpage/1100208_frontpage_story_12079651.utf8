  - DM, SP to be chased out if talks fail: Gurung           OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Kalimpong, Feb. 7: Gorkha Janmukti Morcha president Bimal Gurung today said his party would chase out the top civil and the police officers from the hills and run the administration if nothing positive emerges in the fifth round of tripartite talks, the date for which is yet to be announced.        
	In Darjeeling, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri revealed that the secret proposal sent (by Gurung) to the Centre also pertains to an interim arrangement for the area the party wants as Gorkhaland till the Assembly election in 2011. Every point in our proposal will have to be accepted. However, there will be no compromise on Gorkhaland, he said.        
	Addressing a rally at Deolo, 5km from here, Gurung said there were sufficient experienced persons in the hills to run the administration, and the district magistrate, the superintendent of police and the subdivisional officers would be driven out.         
	We will chase out the DM, the SP, the DSP and the SDOs. We have already done a detailed study. We know how much money is required to pay the salaries of the staff and also how to generate revenue, he added.        
	The student wing of the party, the Vidyarthi Morcha, has already given the call to stall the movement of government and police vehicles in the hills after a lathicharge on Thursday on a group of Gorkhaland supporters on fast in Siliguri for permission to organise a rally in the plains. The same day party had confined the district magistrate in his office in Darjeeling for more than 11 hours. As a backlash to the lathicharge, two NBSTC buses were set on fire in Kalimpong and a constable was beaten up brutally.         
	Gurung declared that the date for the fifth round of talks would be announced by Delhi either on February 9 or 10. Since the talks will be held at the political-level, I would expect Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee (chief minister) and Union home minister P. Chidambaram and myself, as Morcha president, to take part in it, he said.        
	He, however, warned that he would not accept someone like state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya representing the state government at the talks. I will not talk to those who have come through the barbed wire fence from Bangladesh, he added.        
	The Morcha president also took potshots at Sikkim chief minister Pawan Chamling for a petition that a Sikkimese had filed in the Supreme Court against the closure of NH31A  the only road link to the Himalayan state  during statehood agitation. Dont try to break the age-old blood ties between the people of Darjeeling and Sikkim, he said, suggesting that Chamling had a hand in filing the petition.

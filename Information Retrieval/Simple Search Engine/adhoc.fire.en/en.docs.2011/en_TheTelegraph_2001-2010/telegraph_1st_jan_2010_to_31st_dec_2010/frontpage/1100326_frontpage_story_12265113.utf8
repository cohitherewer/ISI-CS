  - Rs 7,028cr fire zone rehab plan gets underway        PRADUMAN CHOUBEY                                                    
	Dhanbad, March 25: More than a decade after it was conceptualised, the Rs 7,028-crore master plan to rehabilitate 200,000-odd victims of a raging underground fire in Jharia was implemented today with the allotment of over 200 new flats at Belgarhia in Baliapur, a safe zone 10km away.        
	At a small function in the new colony christened Jharia Vihar, North Chotanagpur commissioner A.K. Pandey  also the chairman of the Jharia Rehabilitation and Development Authority (JRDA), the implementing agency for the master plan  distributed allotment letters and keys of flats to 216 non-BCCL (illegal settlers) families of Bokapahari, Rajput Bustee, Gwalapatti, Luj pit, Sudamdih Colliery, Naya Dhauda, Kukurtopa and Khairakanal.        
	Another 200 non-BCCL families from these areas, who had expressed interest to be shifted to the new colony through applications, have been invited to the JRDA office for taking the allotment letters.        
	Altogether, four satellite townships  two in Baliapur (Belgarhia and Karmatand) and one each in Topchanchi and Baghmara  are coming up to house those displaced by the underground fire. More than 2,352 flats, each 27sqm in area, have been constructed in the Jharia Vihar Colony in Belgarhia, 6km from the district headquarters. The tender process for construction of another 1,151 quarters to rehabilitate only BCCL families has been completed in the Karmatand area.         
	This apart, the BCCL is carrying out a survey on employee families living in the fire-ravaged areas. The Coal India Limited board has approved construction of a total 16,000 quarters. Among a host of other things, a bypass road is also on the anvil to directly connect Jharia Vihar with Jharia and Dhanbad.        
	Speaking on the occasion, Pandey appealed to the families to shift to their new quarters soon. The concrete structures will become home only when you start living in them, he said.         
	Earlier, in his speech, Dhanbad deputy commissioner Ajay Kumar Singh, also the managing director of JRDA, termed the day as historic. Addressing concerns like sources of livelihood after resettlement and the small size of flats, Singh said he had forwarded the matter to both the Union and state governments, besides the high-powered committee of the coal ministry that is monitoring the rehabilitation.        
	The deputy commissioner also said that the BCCL would help provide jobs and create self-employment opportunities. The JRDA will constitute self-help groups and entrust them with the upkeep of the colony, including ensuring uninterrupted drinking water and electricity supply. A sewing centre for 300-350 women will be started at the township, he said.        
	BCCL director (personnel) P.E. Kachchap, too, assured all support, including training and employment, to the settlers.

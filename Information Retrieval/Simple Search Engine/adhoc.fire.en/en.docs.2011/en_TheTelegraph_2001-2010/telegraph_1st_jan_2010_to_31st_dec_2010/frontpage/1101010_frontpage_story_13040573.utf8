	Brussels, Oct. 9: A planned free trade agreement with India, to be signed this December, will give skilled Indian IT workers, engineers and managers easy passage into Europe in return for European companies gaining access to Indias huge domestic market.         
	The deal has split some of the most senior figures in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition. Vince Cable, the business secretary, and William Hague, the foreign secretary, argue that the EU-India agreement must go ahead because it is worth hundreds of millions of pounds to business. But David Cameron, the Prime Minister, and Theresa May, the home secretary, are opposed. They, and other Conservatives, have insisted that the government uphold a high-profile pledge to bring down net immigration, which is currently at 176,000 entrants a year.         
	We will bring net migration down to the tens of thousands, said May, the home secretary, on Wednesday. Our economy will remain open to the best and the brightest in the world, but its time to stop importing foreign labour on the cheap.         
	Cabinet talks over the deal begin next week and senior government sources have admitted that the circle must be squared to thrash out a government agreement that protects the country from increased immigration without damaging British industry.         
	India has insisted on increased mobility for its skilled workers in return for reduced tariffs on European products and the lifting of some restrictions on businesses bidding for public procurement contracts.         
	Under the current EU negotiating position, Indians who are skilled professionals will be able to work in any EU country under contract. The UK will be bound by any final EU agreement and British companies will be able to recruit in sectors such as information technology, management consultancy and engineering.         
	Many Conservative politicians fear the trade deal will undercut the wages of British managers and make a nonsense of a promise to cap immigration from non-EU countries.         
	The UK is usually on the free-trade wing of the EU and British business is concerned that the country could instead be aligned with more protectionist countries such as France.         
	David Frost, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said companies needed to have the ability to recruit skilled employees from outside Britain.         
	A Brussels study has predicted that under an EU-wide deal with India, Europes economy would grow by 3.9 billion a year.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

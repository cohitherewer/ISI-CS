          SATISH NANDGAONKAR AND RASHEED KIDWAI                                                Bachchan, Shah Rukh       
	Feb. 2: They are not in politics, but the two find themselves at two ends of the political spectrum.        
	Amitabh Bachchan, who has raised eyebrows for agreeing to become the brand ambassador of Narendra Modi-ruled Gujarat, has also warmed to the Shiv Sena, which has targeted Shah Rukh Khan for opposing the non-inclusion of Pakistani cricketers in the Indian Premier League.        
	Away in New York, Shah Rukh continued to defy the Sena and stood by his remarks. The party has threatened to stall the release of the actors My Name is Khan, which is due to hit the screens on February 12. Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan today promised security for the smooth release of the film.        
	Shah Rukh, who, along with co-star Kajol, rang the Nasdaq bell yesterday as part of the films promotion, today lashed out at the campaign against the Pakistani cricketers, terming it unhealthy, undemocratic and insensitive.        
	His stand puts him at one end of the political spectrum. At the other end is Bachchan, whose friend Amar Singh was today expelled from the Samajwadi Party. ( )        
	Gushing praise on Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray, Bachchan has said he would arrange a special screening of his new film Rann for him.         
	In his blog, Bachchan writes: Uddhav Thackeray calls. He has just come out of the theatre after (watching) Rann, and is not able to find appropriate words to describe his appreciation for the film and the performance. Minutes later Balasaheb calls. I want to see this film. Come and show it to me! You have not been to see me for a long time!         
	Unlike Shah Rukh, who has been targeted by the Sena in the past, Bachchan has always received warmth from the Thackerays. The star himself shares a close personal friendship with the 84-year-old Thackeray, though nephew Raj and his MNS had launched a tirade against him last year as part of their anti-north Indian campaign.        
	Bachchan makes his affection for the senior Thackeray clear in his blog: He is resolute and firm as ever and in that resoluteness you discover an endearing, that sudden soft moment, which has always made his presence so strong and affectionate. His sense of humor is intact as he punches in some wise ones!!        
	Sources said that with close friend Amar now a political orphan, it made sense for Bachchan to look for political friends elsewhere.        
	Shah Rukhs support for Pakistani cricketers is being seen as part of an attempt to strengthen his politically correct image ahead of the release of My Name is Khan.

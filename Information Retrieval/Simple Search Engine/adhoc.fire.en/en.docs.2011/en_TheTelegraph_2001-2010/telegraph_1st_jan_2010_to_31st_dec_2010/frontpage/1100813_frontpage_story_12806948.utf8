	Aug. 12: Truck driver Gurjar Singh will have to spend at least 12 days in police custody, unless Calcutta High Court intervenes.        
	Gurjar, whose truck slammed into a police jeep that hit Mamata Banerjees SUV on her way back from the Lalgarh rally on Monday, was granted bail the next day.        
	However, he was re-arrested on Wednesday and sent to police custody today in an unusual roller-coaster of events that transformed the charge of rash and negligent driving into conspiracy and attempt to murder.        
	The new charge was filed by the CID on the basis of an FIR from Trinamul Congress MP Subhendu Adhikary alleging a conspiracy to kill the railway minister. Mamata is now convalescing from injuries suffered when she was flung against the dashboard.        
	The latest charge is so grave  it carries 10 years imprisonment as against five-year jail for rash driving  that the chief judicial magistrate of Tamluk rejected Gurjars bail plea and remanded him in police custody.        
	One of the lawyers representing Gurjar, Ashok Dinda, said in court that once a case is started against a person in one incident, a separate one could not be lodged about the same event against the accused. Only a supplementary affidavit adding the new charges can be filed. Also, as a fresh case cannot be lodged, a re-arrest of the accused is also not possible, Dinda said.        
	A senior advocate of Calcutta High Court, Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee, later supported Dindas contention.        
	Lawyers representing the truck driver said his incarceration was unfair and they would move the high court.        
	Gurjar, who hails from Sangrur in Punjab, was coming from the wrong direction, apparently because the truck brakes had developed a snag and he took a shortcut to avoid a busy flyover.        
	To verify his claim, motor vehicles inspector Moni Chandra had inspected the truck kept at Kolaghat police station. The inspector drove the truck himself and found that the brakes were not working. The truck had air brakes and a leak had developed in the air pressure pipe. That is why the brakes failed that night, a motor vehicles official said.        
	Another factor that should have stood Gurjar in good stead was his conduct after he was released on bail on Tuesday. He remained in Kolaghat and did not flee, opting to stay in a dhaba because his 10-wheeler truck was still in police custody  hardly the response expected from a conspirator out to kill a Union minister.        
	State government officials had also initially said it appeared to be an accident and they could not establish a premeditated motive. However, once Trinamul stepped up an offensive  the party has written to the Prime Minister and raised the issue in Parliament  the state government decided to play safe and handed over the case to the CID. The state home secretary today briefed the governor, too.        
	Lawyer Dinda pointed out that the first case was lodged on the basis of the account of a policeman who was in the convoy. The court heard the case and granted bail to Singh. Subhendu Adhikary who lodged the second FIR was not in the convoy and his FIR is faulty. He has only put his initials in the FIR and did not put any date when he was lodging it. We will move the high court to get my client justice, Dinda said.        
	I have not committed any major crime. I dont know why I am being punished like this. I am not a terrorist and I hail from a poor farmers family. I have a wife and two school-going children. I earn about Rs 3,000 a month and my family is dependent upon this income. I dont know what I will do, Gurjar said while being led out of the court.        
	However, Subrata Bakshi, state Trinamul president, said in response to a question: We suspect that Gurjar Singh was used by the CPM to eliminate Mamatadi. There is no denial that the driver comes from the grassroots but he became a pawn in the hands of the CPM. This is why we want the law to take its own course.        
	Gurjars elder brother has started for Tamluk from Sangrur, which has pockets of Left influence. Sangrur SSP Naunihal Singh said late this evening: So far, we have received no intimation from West Bengal police on him or the place that he claims to be hailing from.        
	Dinda said the police were treating Gurjar well in the lock-up of Kolaghat police station.         
	A lawyer said it was Gurjars bad luck that he had rammed into a VVIP convoy. Normally, in such cases only rash and negligent driving charges, which are bailable, are pressed. Only recently had the police started slapping the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder when fatalities occur.        
	Governor M.K. Narayanan this afternoon called state home secretary Samar Ghosh to Raj Bhavan. I told the governor that the lorry driver had intruded into the railway ministers convoy possibly because of brake failure. However, we are awaiting the final report, Ghosh said.

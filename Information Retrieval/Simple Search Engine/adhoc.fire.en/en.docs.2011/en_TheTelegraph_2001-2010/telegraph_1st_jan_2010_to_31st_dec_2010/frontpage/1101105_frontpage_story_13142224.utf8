  - Bangla student in UK gets life for MP murder bid        Amit Roy                            (Top) Roshonara; East Ham MP Stephen Timms                                      
	London, Nov. 4: Roshonara Choudhry, a Bangladeshi student who was tipped to get a First in English at Kings College London, began a life sentence yesterday for trying to murder her local MP as punishment for his support for the Iraq war.        
	The judge recommended that Roshonara, 21, serve 15 years in prison before she is considered for parole for the attempted murder of Stephen Timms, 55, Labour MP for East Ham.        
	Her college told The Telegraph: Kings College London can confirm that Roshonara Choudhry was a student at the college from September 2007 to April 2010 when she withdrew from her BA English language amp; communication programme.        
	In todays competitive climate, it is not easy to get into a top-flight college such as Kings  especially to read English. But it is possible the well-meaning college relaxed the rules for Roshonara to enable the institution to admit a number of students from disadvantaged Muslim backgrounds  much in the way the quota system operates to help minorities in India.        
	However, according to Alan Fortune, a lecturer in linguistics education at Kings, Roshonara proved to be an outstanding student who was expected to get a First. The world was her oyster, her teacher said.        
	It appears Roshonara was influenced by extremist websites, including one propagating the views of the US-born extremist Anwar al-Awlaki. The cleric, who preaches online in English, is thought to be behind the recent air cargo bomb plot involving packages sent from Yemen, where he is based.        
	The eldest of five children from a Bangladeshi family, Roshonaras mother was born in the UK. Her father had worked as a tailor but he gave up work and the family, which had a home in Central Park Road, East Ham, east London, found it could live very comfortably solely on benefits.        
	On May 14, Roshonara used her academic prize money and savings to pay off her student loan. Then armed with two kitchen knives, she arrived at the surgery of her local MP at the Beckton Globe community centre in east London.         
	During the trial, jurors were shown CCTV images of what happened featuring Roshonaras black shrouded figure and Timms in a purple jumper standing up courteously to greet her.         
	Timms told the court when giving evidence: She looked friendly. She was smiling. I was a little puzzled because a Muslim woman dressed in that way wouldnt normally be willing to shake a mans hand.... She lunged at me with her right hand.I attempted to push away the second lunge but was not successful. I retreated into the gents toilet and lifted up my jumper and realised there was quite a lot of blood there so I realised I had been stabbed.        
	Roshonara told police when she was arrested: I was not going to stop until someone made me. I wanted to kill him... I was going to get revenge for the people of Iraq.         
	Nigel Tai, the surgeon who operated on Timms after he was rushed to hospital, described the injuries as potentially life-threatening because of the possible loss of blood and infection had he not been treated.        
	Jeremy Dein, defending Roshonara, said she did not recognise the jurisdiction of the court. We have been expressly instructed by Miss Choudhry not to advance any argument nor to act to undermine the prosecution in any way.        
	Roshonara, who appeared only via a video link, did not give evidence.         
	The judge, Justice Cooke, said while sentencing Roshonara: You said you ruined the rest of your life. You said it was worth it. You said you wanted to be a martyr. The judge revealed she would continue to be a danger to MPs for the foreseeable future. Roshonara had also drawn up a list of other MPs who had voted in support of the military action in Iraq.        
	The judge told her: You intended to kill in a political cause and to strike at those in the government by doing so. You did so as a matter of deliberate decision-making, however skewed your reasons, from listening to those Muslims who incite such action on the Internet. It is not only possible, but I also hope that you will come to understand the distorted nature of your thinking, the evil that you have done and planned to do, and repent of it.                    
	 You do not suffer from any mental disease. You have simply committed evil acts coolly and deliberately.        
	After the sentence was passed, the videolink was turned off as a group of men in the public gallery began shouting Allahu Akbar, British go to hell and Curse the judge. A small demonstration was also held outside court.        
	The judge expressed his best wishes to Timms and referred to the MPs Christian beliefs.

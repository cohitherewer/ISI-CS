The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PM plan for Valley blockaded
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                PM plan for Valley blockaded
  - Pressure piles on Omar,   Delhi ties under strain        SANKARSHAN THAKUR                       Omar Abdullah                                      
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: On a day this summers nastiest bouts of violence claimed 14 lives in the Kashmir Valley, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh found his peace package blockaded by mounting concerns over the security implications of revoking the armed forces act in some non-border districts.        
	A three-hour meeting of the cabinet committee on security (CCS) this evening failed to iron out internal discord and ended on the rather anodyne note of issuing another appeal for calm in Kashmir.        
	On Monday, 14 persons lost their lives in the deadliest day yet of azaadi protests in the Valley, the anger and violence being fanned by an Iranian channel that aired footage of the alleged desecration of the Quran in the US.        
	In addition to renewing its dialogue offer to address the issues agitating the minds of the people of J amp;K, especially the youth, the CCS also called an all-party meeting on Wednesday on the spiralling crisis.        
	But having failed to push the initiative through the CCS, the Prime Minister is unlikely to find endorsement from a wider body. The BJP, already a vociferous critic of any bid to tinker with the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), will, on the contrary, demand that the Omar Abdullah government be dismissed for its failure to get a grip on the law and order situation, making the Prime Ministers predicament even more confounded.        
	It is not merely the defence forces that have stiffened opposition to any changes to the AFSPA, the Congress, too, is divided.         
	Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, for instance, is strongly opposed to any security content in the peace package and has been arguing that the Omar government must be pressured to get a grip on the unrest that has claimed over 80 lives over the past three months.        
	It is perhaps significant in this context that among the issues the CCS statement promised to address were that of trust deficit and governance deficit.         
	While the Centre has consistently backed Omar through the current crisis, it has been less than pleased with his handling of the situation and positively disappointed with his disconnect with the agitating Kashmiri masses.        
	As the peace package remains mired in differences, political pressure is building on Omar who finds himself caught between an incensed constituency and a Centre that is dragging its feet on providing him concessions that he could sell in Kashmir.        
	Omar, sources in the National Conference said, was angry and upset that New Delhi had not been able to deliver what he had repeatedly been promised.         
	We need something to go to the people with, expectations have been raised and when nothing happens, it strengthens the hands of those in Kashmir who say New Delhi is not interested in addressing the aspirations of the people of Kashmir, a senior National Conference leader told The Telegraph.        
	A measure of Omars exasperation was the fact that late tonight he fielded two ministers  Ali Mohammed Sagar and Ghulam Hasan Mir  to attack the Centre for hurting genuine Kashmiri aspirations by consistently failing to deliver on promises.         
	Arguing that the Omar government was fighting a tough battle against separatist and militant elements in the Valley, an irate Sagar said: We have the responsibility of leading our people and fulfilling their aspirations. New Delhi is not helping the cause by continuing to be indecisive about announcements that the people of Kashmir have been expecting.

          RUDRA BISWAS                              
	Ranchi, June 23: Madhu Koda sank deeper into the morass of corruption cases today when a court in Ranchi issued letters rogatory to Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), where a close associate of the former chief minister is suspected to have diverted state funds to the tune of Rs 270 crore using hawala channels.        
	A request was made by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) before the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court of special judge Pankaj Kumar, confirmed special public prosecutor S.R. Das, adding that the court had acceded to the request of issuing letters rogatory, the mode of obtaining judicial assistance from abroad in the absence of a treaty or executive agreement.        
	Koda has been lodged at Birsa Munda Central Jail at Hotwar since his arrest by the state vigilance bureau from Chaibasa on September 30 last year.         
	While the ED has charged him under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, the vigilance bureau is probing his assets disproportionate to known sources of income.        
	Das said after the nationwide raids by the income tax department and ED last year, a detailed investigation of documents seized from the Pune residence of broker Anil Adinath Bastavade revealed that a whopping Rs 270 crore of state funds had been allegedly siphoned off to Dubai through hawala channels.        
	The documents revealed that Bastavade had invested around Rs 55 crore in two projects in Dubai  Master Developers at Downtown, Jebel Ali Zone 2, Dubai, and another Rs 102 crore at Master Developers, Jumeirah village.        
	At Jebel Ali Zone 2, around 50 per cent of the total investments were in the name of Bastavade.         
	The documents also revealed that substantial investments had been made by Bastavade in other residential and commercial buildings at Lake Burje and at Deema in Dubai.        
	Das explained that since letters rogatory were mere requests by the court of a country to the judiciary of another country, these would be attached with detailed questionnaires for the foreign courts to act upon.        
	In December last year, letters rogatory were issued by the PMLA court in Ranchi to Sweden, Indonesia, Liberia, Thailand and the UAE against Kodas associates, Binod Sinha and Sanjay Choudhury, and hawala operators for allegedly diverting crores of rupees from the state.

	Guwahati, Aug. 21: A high-level team, led by Assam home commissioner Jishnu Baruah, will visit Itanagar on Monday to attend a meeting convened by the commission constituted by the Supreme Court to find a solution to the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh boundary row.         
	The three-member commission, comprising a retired Supreme Court judge, an official from the Survey of India and a forest department official, was constituted by the apex court soon after the Assam government filed a lawsuit in the apex court in 1989, accusing Arunachal Pradesh of grabbing the states land.         
	Baruah told The Telegraph that the commission had held several rounds of meetings with officials of both the states since its formation and Mondays would be the final one before it submits its report to the apex court.         
	Violent clashes over territorial supremacy have often erupted along the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh boundary with both the states accusing each other of grabbing land. Such incidents have occurred in Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Sonitpur and Sivasagar districts of Assam.        
	Baruah said the state team would highlight before the commission the latest attacks by goons from Arunachal Pradesh on Assam villagers at Charaipung in Sivasagar.        
	The attacks had started on August 14, when a hundred-strong mob from Arunachal Pradesh, backed by Naga militants, assaulted villagers at Charaipung and damaged the Charaipung police station, which was under construction. The attacks continued over the next few days. Yesterday, the goons crossed over into Assam and opened fire on police camps at Charaipung despite the two states having decided on Thursday to take up confidence-building measures to restore normality.         
	Baruah said additional forces had been rushed to the boundary soon after the attacks began on Saturday and the situation has almost returned to normal now. There were no reports of fresh incidents today, he said.        
	We have taken all necessary measures to protect our land and provide security to the people residing in the border areas, he added.        
	Baruah said the matter had been taken up with the Arunachal Pradesh government and Assam had lodged a strong protest. As part of the confidence-building measures, both the sides have agreed to hold joint patrolling in the border areas and regular peace meetings between villagers of the two states, he added. The Assam delegation had been led by law minister Pranab Gogoi and the Arunachal Pradesh team by home minister Tako Dabi.         
	Baruah said the government would soon start reconstructing Charaipung police station and provide security to prevent further attacks. The present police station is located a kilometre away from the site of the new building.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mulayam Singh Yadav                                  
	Lucknow, March 14: The cycle, the party symbol of Mulayam Singh Yadav, threatened to involve him in a plane crash yesterday afternoon on his pet airstrip.        
	As a plane carrying the Samajwadi Party chief from Delhi to hometown Saifai landed around 4pm, two cyclists strayed onto the runway and came dangerously close to the 10-seater aircraft.        
	TV footage shows the plane trying to avoid the cyclists as they head towards the aircraft on the airstrip, which former chief minister Mulayam had upgraded at state cost so his Bollywood guests could arrive in large aircraft.        
	It was a narrow escape for Mulayam Singh Yadav, said one of his relatives, Sonu Yadav.        
	Police officers in Etawah, Mulayams home district, said they had hired cyclists to ward off neelgais, a species of antelope from the nearby forest range.        
	The animals are notorious. They destroy crops and often come in the way of cars on the roads, causing accidents, an officer said. While trying to chase them, the cyclists may have strayed onto the runway.        
	Mulayam, who arrived in Lucknow this morning, blamed Mayavati admini- stration officials for the security lapse.        
	A subdivisional magistrate is supposed to take care of the airports security. Mayavatis officials are busy doing everything except their own work, he alleged. I think it is an official lapse. I am grateful to God for saving my life.        
	The state government has ordered a probe. Some officials said the airstrips security may have slackened because it is located in a remote rural area and receives only one or two planes a month  hardly enough to keep a subdivisional official busy.        
	The airstrip is 1km from Saifai, a village 190km west of Lucknow, and is set in the middle of wetlands and water bodies that are a habitat of cranes and attract the neelgais.        
	In 2005, when Mulayam was chief minister, he had sanctioned over Rs 500 crore to develop Saifai, where he organises a cultural extravaganza every year. A chunk of the money was spent upgrading the airstrip so that airliners could bring his friends, such as Amitabh Bachchan, and other movie stars to the festival.        
	Ironically, Mulayams party has been organising cycle rallies over the past week, with young Samajwadi workers pedalling around the state to revive the party support base.        
	Several VIP aircraft have had a scare in recent months. In November, a plane carrying Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and governor Rameshwar Thakur nearly collided with two air force vehicles while landing in Gwalior.        
	In February last year, one of the three defence helicopters in President Pratibha Patils convoy had landed right in front of a Delhi-bound Indian Airlines flight at Mumbai airport, forcing the plane to abort take-off.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                    Meira paibis stage a demonstration in Imphal on Sunday. Picture by Eastern Projections      
	Kohima, May 9: The Naga Hoho, the apex Naga organisation, in an emergency meeting last night has derecognised boundaries drawn between Nagaland and Manipur.        
	The move came after Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh refused to allow general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), Thuingaleng Muivah, to visit his native village Somdal in Ukhrul district.        
	Though Muivah deferred his visit, his supporters clashed with security at Mao Gate, resulting in the death of two students on May 6.        
	Henceforth, we derecognise any artificial boundary drawn across our ancestral lands in the present Manipur state, the Hoho said.         
	It said Nagas land has been dissected through colonial designs. It declared that Nagas are one nation and will stand together as a people and that any attack on the Naga people will be considered as an attack on our nation.         
	The Hoho also strongly warned the Manipur government and a particular community inhabiting Manipur valley that Nagas would react if the Naga people were harmed in that state.         
	Any harm done to our citizens presently held hostage in the Imphal valley will be countered by befitting actions, the Naga apex body said.        
	Stating that the Manipur government has waged a war against the Naga people, the Hoho reiterated its support Nagas historical rights.         
	We consider the recent killings of our students, injury to hundreds of our innocent citizens and looting and destruction of proper- ties at villages in Mao Naga area by the Manipur gove- rnment as an open declara-tion of war against the Nagas, the Hoho said.         
	The Manipur government today relaxed the curfew in Mao area during the day, adds PTI.        
	This evening, however, unidentified miscreants assaulted members of the Naga Hoho in Kohima, though the motive is unclear.        
	The police are yet to confirm the details of the incident but a source said armed miscreants assaulted Chuba Ozukum, general secretary of Naga Hoho, G. Vashum, joint secretary of the Hoho, and Nepuni Piku, a member of Naga peoples movement for human rights, at Hotel Grandeur in the heart of Kohima town.        
	They were severely beaten up with gun butts and were admitted to Naga Hospital.         
	The miscreants also allegedly took away laptops, mobiles and cash from them.        
	Ozukum and Vashum are in ICU, while Piku was released after first aid.         
	The overseas Naga Association has expressed shock at the turn of events in Nagaland and Manipur, which prevented Muivah from entering Manipur.         
	The association also expressed solidarity with the Naga people in Manipur.         
	This is a case of an unconscionable abuse of power by the Okram Ibobi Singh government which has already led to deadly consequences and whose effects will sadly be long lasting, Visier Sanyu, president, and Paul Pimomo, secretary general of the association, said.         
	They said the Naga and Meitei communities have a complicated history and the role of the government in both states would be to act in ways that would promote goodwill and peace.         
	They said the Manipur government has provoked anger among the Nagas and egged on the Meitei community, thereby inflaming the passions of the two people whose lives are unavoidably interdependent.         
	The Nagaland Baptist Church Council has appealed to everyone to exercise restraint, the PTI report said.

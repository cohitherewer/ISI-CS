          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Nani Dey                                  
	Beldanga (Murshidabad), May 10: A Class X student killed himself in a remote Bengal village after being told he must wait till the end of the paddy harvesting season for his reference books.        
	Nani Dey, the only one in his family to have studied this far, was worried he was falling behind in class in the absence of the books.        
	The 17-year-old had his standard textbooks, which he had got for Rs 100 from his school.         
	But he felt that in Class X, he needed a few more to do well.        
	Nani was not a brilliant student ---- he had scored 52 per cent in his Class IX annuals ---- but desperately wanted to do well.        
	Classmate Anirban Kundu said: All of us had planned to buy reference books for English, physical science, life science, mathematics, geography and history. I have already bought three books. They together cost me over Rs 700.        
	Nanis father Bijoy, 70, never went to school, nor did five of his seven children --- four sons and three daughters.        
	He said Nani told him about his problem after returning from school on Saturday, but he did not realise its importance.        
	I told him I would speak to him later. Nani again came to me sometime later and told me about the books. He also told me that his friends had got their books and that their classes had started in full swing, Bijoy said.        
	Irritated, he told his son he did not have the money for the books.        
	I told him I would be able to buy him the books only after selling the paddy that is to be harvested at the end of this month. He did not react.        
	On Saturday evening, Nani went crying to his father and told him he had drunk poison. He told me he had consumed pesticide because I could not buy him the books, a sobbing Bijoy said.         
	Nani, a student of the Ramakrishna Mission-run school at Sargachhi in Beldanga, about 190km from Calcutta, died in hospital late on Sunday night.        
	Nanis eldest brother Sanjoy, 30, said his father and one of his younger brothers, Laltu, tilled the familys small plot.        
	The money they earn is not enough and Laltu also has to work on others land to run the family. My father is old and cant toil like before, he said.        
	Sanjoy, the only other member of the family to have gone to school, had studied only till Class VI.        
	He is a farm labourer but has left the parental home after marriage, like the brother immediately after him.        
	The principal of Nanis school, Swami Suprabhananda, said he was shocked to hear that Nani had committed suicide.        
	Police said the body had been sent for post-mortem, and that there was no reason to suspect foul play.

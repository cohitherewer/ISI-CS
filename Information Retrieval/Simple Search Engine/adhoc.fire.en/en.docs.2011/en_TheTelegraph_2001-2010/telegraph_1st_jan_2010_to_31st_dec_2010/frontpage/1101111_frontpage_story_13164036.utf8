The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cong outsider, Pawar insider
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cong outsider, Pawar insider
  - Union minister to be Maharashtra CM, Sharads nephew deputy           SANJAY K. JHA AND SATISH NANDGAONKAR                      Prithviraj Chavan.   Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                
	Nov. 10: The arrival of an outsider at Maharashtras helm has prompted Sharad Pawar to deploy an insider in the battlefield.         
	Prithviraj Chavan, a Maratha who is being parachuted from the Union ministry to the chief ministers seat in Mumbai, is almost an outsider in the murky political environs of Maharashtra.        
	On the same day the Congress brought in Prithviraj, who was minister of state in the PMO, Nationalist Congress Party boss Pawar decided to crown his nephew Ajit the deputy chief minister, the manoeuvre born out of a long tussle to gain control over the powerful Maratha lobby in the state. Ajit, 54, is the son of Sharad Pawars elder brother Anantrao Pawar.        
	Outgoing deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal is an OBC (Mali) leader who has little clout in western Maharashtra, known as Pawars fief. Although Ashok Chavan was also a Maratha, Pawar sniffs a chance to tilt the scales in favour of the NCP because the 64-year-old Prithviraj, a US-educated technocrat, is almost alien to the co-operative-driven power structure of the region.                              FAMILY MATTERS: Sharad Pawar and his daughter Supriya Sule leave Parliament on Wednesday while his nephew Ajit Pawar prepares for coronation as deputy chief minister in Mumbai. (AFP amp; PTI pictures)      
	Yes, the timing is important, said a senior NCP leader. Ajit Pawar would have been promoted sooner or later, but we grabbed this opportunity to send a clear message on who is Pawars heir in Maratha politics.        
	Before Prithviraj gets a foothold, Ajit would have established his supremacy. In the battle for Maratha votes, Prithviraj adds no value to Congress politics whereas Ajit was a potent force waiting to get into his own.        
	Pawar has now clearly indicated that nephew Ajit, the Baramati MLA, will look after Maharashtra politics after him, and daughter Supriya Sule, the Baramati MP, will lead the party at the national level.        
	The demarcation has come at the right time as Ajit, known to be a good political manager, will now build the party with greater responsibility than waste time on internal power struggles. He was upset after Pawar ignored his claim during government formation last time and pitched Bhujbal for deputy chief minister.        
	NCP sources revealed that most MLAs had backed Ajit even then but Pawar thought Bhujbals seniority could not be ignored. Bhujbal is very fussy about seniority and has always had strained relations with Ajit.        
	Even today, sources said, Bhujbal threatened to quit the party but relented only after he was assured he would be allowed to retain the public works ministry and given an additional one, such as home. If Bhujbal, who has revived contact with Bal Thackeray and has a strong OBC base, continues to sulk, his son Pankaj, an MLA, could be offered a berth,        
	However, NCP leader Praful Patels announcement of Ajits crowning revealed no cracks. At the beginning of the meeting, Chhagan Bhujbal proposed Ajit Pawars name, and it was seconded by R.R. Patil. So, as central observers, we did not have much to do. The legislators had decided what they wanted.        
	Asked why the NCP had chosen to replace Bhujbal, Patel said: There is no reason other than the fact that the Adarsh society controversy happened, and the ministry was dissolved. A new leader had to be elected.        
	But the change of guard did not come without internal bickering, sources said. Ajits loyalists had apparently begun garnering signatures from MLAs since last evening. By this afternoon, they claimed the support of over 50 of 62 NCP legislators and all 11 Independents.        
	Bhujbal said he had proposed Ajits name because he was young, had done good work and was capable of handling legislative affairs. My position in the party remains the same. Whatever additional responsibility the party wants to give me, it is up to the party.        
	Ajit, known as Ajitdada, made his debut as MP from Baramati in 1991. He returned to Maharashtra as MLA from Baramati and has been in all Congress-NCP cabinets since 1999.        
	Ajits political acumen came to the fore when he upstaged the Congresss Suresh Kalmadi in Pune in March 2007. In the Pune Municipal Corporation elections that year, the NCP tally went up from 24 councillors to 42 and the Kalmadi-led Congresss shrank from 64 to 35. Ajit then engineered a tie-up with the Opposition Sena-BJP, which had 45 seats, to keep the Congress out of power.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Huddle of 8 MLAs thickens JMM plot

	Ranchi, May 14: The anti-Hemant Soren lobby became active again today to drum up support in favour of chief minister Shibu Soren taking advantage of the BJPs inability to declare a chief ministerial nominee.        
	 At least eight MLAs went into a huddle at a hotel in Jamshedpur and vowed to ensure that Soren wasnt replaced by a BJP nominee. They included Simon Marandi, Teklal Mahto, Champai Soren, Deepak Birua, Vidyut Baran Mahto, Lobin Hembrom, Nalin Soren and Lobin Hembrom.        
	The group also claimed support of two other MLAs, namely, Sorens daughter-in-law Sita and Paulus Surin, who is in jail.        
	Simon told The Telegraph the MLAs were firm in their support for Soren. It is inhuman to humiliate and oust Guruji, who has struggled for 40 years for a separate state, he maintained.        
	Though none would admit it, party sources claimed the MLAs might have got tacit support from Soren himself. Soren senior might be using these MLAs to cut Hemant to size, a source close to Guruji said.        
	Chaibasa MLA Deepak Birua said the political stalemate was sending a wrong message to the people. So, we decided to ask Guruji to tell the BJP clearly that he will be continuing till June 29, he said, adding the BJPs indecisiveness was leading the state to Presidents rule.        
	However, their rivals claimed the MLAs stand was denting the credibility of the JMM further. We are already known for taking whimsical decisions. So, if we go back on our pledge to the BJP, no political party will be willing to do business with us in future, said a source close to Hemant.        
	For now, the JMM has constituted an 11-member core committee to take decisions on the organisational issues in view of the changing political scenario. The members include Hemant Soren, Teklal Mahto, Haji Hussain Ansari, Champai Soren, Hemlal Murmu, Sudhir Mahto, Shashank Shekhar Bhokta, Mohan Karmakar, Supriyo Bhattacharya, Jagannath Mahto and Vinod Pandey.        
	The notification was signed by Soren.         
	Ajsu chief and deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto appeared cut up and said the BJP and JMM should behave responsibly to end the impasse immediately in the larger interest of the state.

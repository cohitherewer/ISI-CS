The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Poll panel freezes on Nov-Dec
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Poll panel freezes on Nov-Dec
  - Cabinet to okay dates for   panchayat elections         AMIT GUPTA                                                           
	Ranchi, Oct. 5: State Election Commission is understood to have recommended that the long-delayed panchayat polls for Jharkhand be held in five phases between November 16 and December 31, but the state government is likely to take a final decision on the dates only after Friday when chief minister Arjun Munda announces his council of ministers.        
	Today, state election commissioner S.D. Sharma left it to the Munda government to formally announce the dates, but clarified the poll panel had decided to stick to the November-December schedule.        
	At this juncture, I am not in a position to reveal the exact dates. It would be possible only after the state government agrees on them and then forwards them to the governor, he told The Telegraph.        
	According to high level sources, if the state government decides to stick to the election commission schedule, the electoral process for the first phase would have to begin from the last week of October.        
	But before giving its seal of approval, the state government needs to study the nitty-gritty of conducting such an exercise that involves over one crore rural voters.         
	Once it is satisfied that it can meet all requirements, like providing election personnel and security forces, the state government would send the final dates to Raj Bhavan for Governor M..H. Farooks approval.        
	Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto said the election commissions recommendations had to be okayed by the full cabinet. It is a vital decision and requires to be approved by the full cabinet, said the deputy chief minister who held the rural development and panchayati raj department under the Shibu Soren government.        
	Sudhir Tripathy, principal secretary to the governor, said Raj Bhavan had received a copy of the election commissions recommendations. But, Raj Bhavan would act only after the state government formally forwards it to the governor, he added.        
	Jharkhand will be holding panchayat elections after three decades  the last time was in the late 70s under unified Bihar.         
	The plan this time is to keep the elections apolitical, but of late, several parties, including Congress and JVM, have been demanding that voting be held on party lines.         
	State Congress spokesperson Shailesh Sinha felt that if rural polls were held on party lines, elected panchayat representatives would be more responsible towards the welfare of the people.        
	However, he clarified, that the issue should not be a reason to postpone the elections. If the government faces problems in holding the polls on party lines at this juncture, it is better to stick to the plan. The Congress is of the view that panchayat elections should be held immediately at any cost, he said.        
	The office of the state election commission is already abuzz with activity. Work is on to prepare various brochures, manuals and forms for the rural polls.        
	Today, chief secretary A.K. Singh held a meeting with panchayati raj director Shubhendra Jha. Yesterday, Sharma held a security meeting with IG (operations) R.K. Mallick.         
	Notably, 18 of the 24 districts are known Naxalite strongholds and providing security in these areas for the rural polls will pose a serious challenge to the authorities.

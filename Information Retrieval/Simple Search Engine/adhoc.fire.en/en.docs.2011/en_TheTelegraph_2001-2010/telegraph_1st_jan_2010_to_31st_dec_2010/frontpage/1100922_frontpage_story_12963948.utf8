	A student of Heramba Chandra College who was apparently involved in a self-immolation bid in the principals room and one of his friends have been charged with attempts to murder and suicide.        
	Principal Khagendranath Adhikari said Chand Prakash Singh and Mukesh Tripathi  missing since Mondays incident  would be suspended.        
	Charges have been slapped on them following a complaint by the principal. If found guilty, they can be imprisoned for up to 10 years. said a police officer.

If their registration is cancelled, they would be barred from taking any exam of the university, to which the college is affiliated, said a syndicate member.        
	Metro spoke to one of the absconding students, Singh, over the phone on Tuesday. I was protesting poor classes in the college in the principals room when he insulted me by saying I should rather die than stage a drama. I lost my cool and filled a container with petrol from a friends motorbike and poured it on myself, said Chand.        
	When the principal tried to stop me, a few drops fell on him. He panicked and kept saying that I was trying to set him on fire. The principal later assured me that he would not lodge a complaint against me. But today I came to know that he has accused me of trying to kill him. My career has been ruined.        
	Sources said Tripathi had thrown a matchstick at the principal. The south Calcutta college has been shut down indefinitely.        
	The West Bengal College and University Teachers Association and the All Bengal Principals Council will hold a rally in front of the college on September 23 to condemn the incident.

          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                      Uparghat in Nawadih block of Bokaro from where Maoist leader J Narsimha Reddy alias Jampanna was arrested                          
	Bokaro, Aug. 8: A joint operation by Bokaro police and CRPF personnel led to the arrest of top Maoist leader J. Narsimha Reddy alias Jampanna alias Gaganna (45) and four others from Rallivera village of Nawadih block, about 76km from Bokaro steel city, late last night.        
	Reddy carried a reward of Rs 10 lakh on his head and is wanted in a number of cases in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Orissa.         
	A member of the CPI(Maoist) central military commission, Reddy was arrested from a hut he had shifted into barely a week ago in the Uparghat zone.         
	A laptop, a 9mm pistol, 10 cartridges and some documents related to Naxalite operations in Jharkhand, Bengal, Orissa and Chhattisgarh were seized from him.        
	Though the police claimed that Reddy was arrested late last night, sources said he and two others were actually arrested four days ago after a two-month-long hunt by the Bokaro police. He had been difficult to track as he changed hideouts often and almost never used any communication device.        
	The sources added that Reddy suffered a knee injury during a recent police operation in East Singhbhum, where he had gone with his men to help Kundan Pahan. After getting hurt, he managed to escape to Nawadih where he was undergoing treatment.        
	Reddys arrest was the third most significant catch by the Bokaro police in the last three years. The force was successful in nabbing Pramod Mishra in June 2008 from Dhanbad and then Mohammad Hussain alias Anna from Chas in February 2009. Anna too carried a reward of Rs 10 lakh.        
	Speaking about Reddys arrest, Bokaro SP Saket Singh said he played a key role in planning attacks on security forces in Orissa and Chhattisgarh.        
	Commandant of CRPFs 26th Battalion S.H.M.I. Malik said Reddy was working on his laptop when the security forces zeroed in on him.        
	Confirming the arrest, North Chotanagpur IG Manoj Mishra said more arrests would follow once Reddy started talking.        
	Reddys wife was reportedly a top Naxalite in neighbouring Chhattisgarh.

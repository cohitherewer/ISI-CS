The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Thank you, PM; No thanks, Centre 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Thank you, PM; No thanks, Centre 
          NALIN VERMA                            Nitish Kumar, Manmohan Singh                                 
	Patna, Nov. 24: Nitish Kumar today thanked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for congratulating him on his sweeping triumph but lashed out at the way the Congress had tried to negate the work done by the state government.        
	Without naming either Congress chief Sonia Gandhi or her son Rahul, Nitish said claims like whatever development was taking place in the state was because of central largesse amounted to hurting the sentiment of the people.        
	The Centre has not been giving anything to the state in alms. Whatever the Centre has given to the state is its constitutionally rightful share, he said.        
	With the Congress decimated in Bihar, the comments were a clear indication that a tie-up with the party would, at least for some time, be the last thing on the mind of Nitish, whose alliance with the BJP has held despite occasional strains.        
	The Janata Dal (United) leader, however, said he was grateful to Singh for the congratulatory message.        
	I am grateful to him for congratulating me, he said, confirming a phone call from the Prime Minister. I will soon seek an appointment with him and will go to meet him to discuss the issues of Bihars development.        
	The Dal (U) leader went on to assert that it was development that had returned him to power with a thumping majority as he hit out at the Congress for trying to slight his governments efforts.        
	They tried to negate the work done by the state government for the people of the state, he said.        
	Nitish said statements like Bihar is not changing, Biharis were shining elsewhere and not in Bihar and no progress was taking place in Bihar had proved counter-productive for the Congress. The people at large watched how our government had taken the state out of the morass, he told reporters.         
	Although he didnt name Rahul, the Congress general secretary had throughout his campaign in the state kept saying that Biharis were shining elsewhere and the Centre was funding the states development.        
	Nitish had hit back, suggesting Rahul should first become a chief minister to appreciate the challenges of working in a state.        
	Sonia, too, had claimed that it was central largesse that had speeded up development in the state.        
	The comment had prompted Nitish to invite Sonia to a debate on central assistance.        
	Nitish today said statements like Bihar was developing with central funds had hurt the pride of the masses (of Bihar). After all, they had elected the government which they had watched delivering the goods, he said as the results poured in.        
	By claiming that whatever development was taking place in the state was because of central largesse amounted to hurting the sentiment of the people.

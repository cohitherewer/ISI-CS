The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rahul challenge for Bhuniya
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rahul challenge for Bhuniya
          ASHIS CHAKRABARTI                            (From top): Rahul and Bhuniya                          
	Calcutta, Sept. 4: Rahul Gandhi has been holding rallies somewhere in the country almost every other week. The states where the Congress has been in decline for years Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and Orissa  seem to be priority areas for his revival strategy for the Congress. But it will be a lot more than this straightforward story when he takes the stage on the Shahid Minar grounds on Monday.        
	No one in Bengal knows this better than the new Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president, Manas Bhuniya, for whom Rahuls rally is both a challenge and an opportunity.        
	To get an idea of what the rally means for Bhuniya and the Bengal Congress, compare it with Rahuls campaigns in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar or Orissa.        
	In Orissa, the Congresss revival requires a battle for political space with Naveen Patnaiks Biju Janata Dal. In Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has to fight for space with Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party, Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party and the BJP. In Bihar, the Congress has to combat Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan to create its own space.        
	Only in Bengal does the Congress have to fight an ally in the UPA government, Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress, to create its own anti-CPM space. Unlike most other states, in Bengal the party does not have to worry about the BJP, at least not immediately.        
	Officially, Rahul will be here to launch the Youth Congresss membership drive. From the stage at Shahid Minar, he will urge his flock to help rebuild the Congress and oust the CPM from power. But he would know what this entails for Bhuniya and his team in the PCC. For the PCC team, a more important signal may come from Rahuls meeting with it after the Shahid Minar rally.        
	With the CPM losing ground and possibly set to lose Writers Buildings next year, the race is on for the other parties to grab their own space. Mamata has already captured most of the anti-CPM space and will try everything to not only hold on to her base but also expand it. But Mamatas rise has been in direct proportion to the Congresss decline. Any further expansion of her ground can only mean the Congress space shrinking even more.        
	It isnt a question of a choice for Mamata; its her compulsion because, like all regional party leaders in India, she can claim her place in New Delhi only by virtue of her strength in Bengal.                     
	The Congress has its options elsewhere in India, but Mamata must have Bengal or nothing.        
	That creates a problem for Bhuniya and the Bengal Congress. He has battles to fight on three fronts -- the CPM, factions within the Bengal Congress and Trinamul, with the last proving to be the toughest.        
	Many in the Bengal Congress were surprised when Bhuniya was picked as the new PCC president in end-June. Compared with his predecessors like Pranab Mukherjee, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury or even Somen Mitra, Bhuniya was considered a lightweight.        
	But Bhuniya has surprised the sceptics over the past two months. Two weeks into his new job, he hit the roads, starting with Mangalkot, where he ran through paddy fields last year to escape a belligerent CPM mob, and holding rallies in Khejuri, Chinsurah, Tamluk, Sainthia, Behrampore, Keshpur and Calcutta.        
	If Mangalkot and Keshpur witnessed his forays into CPM territory, in Khejuri he met hostile Trinamul activists who had earlier heckled Usha Naidu, the Youth Congress leader sent to Bengal as part of Rahuls revive-the-Congress campaign. Trinamul leaders were openly furious with Bhuniya for trespassing into their territory.        
	When I was appointed PCC president, I had three messages from Sonia Gandhi: reach out to the people, confront the CPMs anti-people policies and rebuild the party. Rahul Gandhi said the same thing when I met him, Bhuniya says.        
	Bengal Congress leaders are giving him due credit for at least trying sincerely. For whatever they are worth, Congress posters and banners are back in Calcutta after a long time, even if many of these carry Bhuniyas own photographs. Rahuls rally has added to that visibility for the party.        
	I dont know whos doing it, but for the past few days, posters on Rahul Gandhis meetings are being torn down in parts of Calcutta, Bhuniya complains. The interesting thing is that he isnt blaming the CPM for this. Other Congress leaders see a Trinamul hand.        
	The Congress in Bengal has suffered in the past few years because of the high commands relations with the CPM. Well be wiped out if we are now condemned to slavery to Trinamul, a senior party leader warned.        
	The message is aimed at the Congress high command, which has a history of riding roughshod over the sentiments of the party in Bengal. How far Bhuniya can go to rebuild the party may, therefore, depend largely on how serious the high command is about reviving the Congress in Bengal.        
	Bhuniya and other PCC leaders agree that the decline of the CPM gives them a long-awaited opportunity. They are waiting to read the fine print in Rahuls plan for Bengal.

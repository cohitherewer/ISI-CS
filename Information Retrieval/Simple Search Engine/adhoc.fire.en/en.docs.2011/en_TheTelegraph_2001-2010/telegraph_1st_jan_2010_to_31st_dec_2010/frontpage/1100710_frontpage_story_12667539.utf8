                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Woman lies ill on kerb for a week

	Guwahati, July 9: It took a week to admit a poor and critically ill woman to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital though she was lying on the kerb a stones throw away from its modern emergency unit.        
	For the past seven days, no one bothered to take the ailing woman to hospital for treatment till an advocate jogging past her early this morning noticed that she was not just a beggar but seriously ill.        
	After seeing her at 5.30am, I immediately rushed to the emergency ward of the GMCH. Two boys sitting at the reception counter told me that the hospital could not admit a patient without a guardian. The woman could be admitted only after the police register a case. When I went to Bhangagarh police station inside the GMCH campus, most of the personnel were sleeping. I left the police station only after an official assured me that the woman would be taken care of, advocate Siddhartha Sankar Dey told The Telegraph.        
	However, she was still lying by the littered wayside unattended to when Dey crossed the area at 10am on his way to Gauhati High Court. I became angry and informed Arman Ali, a friend of mine and an NGO activist, to do something urgently, he said.        
	Ali, an executive director of Sishu Sarothi, said he called top officials in the health department and Assam police, most of whom stressed on formalities rather than provide treatment to the woman.         
	The woman, who is too weak to even give her name, was admitted to the GMCH this evening after a lengthy debate among the police, hospital authorities, health department officials and NGO workers as to who would be her guardian. She was finally taken in without one, considering her critical condition. GMCH superintendent Ramen Talukdar said she was undergoing treatment in the emergency block. He said she was severely undernourished and suffering from multiple infections and other ailments.        
	The hospital faces legal and administrative hassles in admitting patients without guardians. I have convened a meeting on Monday to discuss the issue with NGOs and police, he added.         
	Ali said it was high time to discuss the provision of medical treatment and other facilities to destitutes in the city.        
	Sudarshan Das Medhi, a local youth, said, Had Mother Teresa been alive, she would have been shocked by the extreme insensitivity shown towards the poor and sick woman by every passerby. I am not free from guilt either. I saw her a week ago and passed by, thinking she was a beggar.

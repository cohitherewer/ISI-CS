	Midnapore, Feb. 15: Maoist guerrillas today stormed an Eastern Frontier Rifles camp and killed at least 24 policemen in their biggest strike yet on a state force, taking advantage of a weekly bazaar as they crept up on the unsuspecting cops.        
	Before leaving, the rebels, many of them women, set fire to the camp in Shilda, 75km from Midnapore town.        
	When police reinforcements from Binpur and Belpahari, some 8-10km away, reached the spot about three hours later trekking through forests to avoid mined roads, they found bodies strewn across the tents still smouldering on the grounds of the local primary health centre. Some policemen, who had taken bullets during the one-hour 5pm attack, lay groaning.        
	At least 21 policemen have died in the attack, said West Midnapore district magistrate N.S. Nigam.        
	This is the heaviest casualty that Bengal police have suffered at the hands of Maoists, said Surajit Kar Purkayastha, IG, law and order. Never before have the police here suffered so many losses in one attack. Arms and ammunition were also looted. We are taking stock to find out just how much has been looted.        
	Later in the night, Maoist guerrilla wing chief Kishanji warned of more attacks unless Operation Greenhunt was stopped. This is our reply to Operation Greenhunt that has been launched against us, especially since innocent villagers are also being targeted. Unless the operation is halted, we shall carry on with such attacks, not just in Bengal but all across the country, he said.              
	Our appeal to the policemen is to leave Jangalmahal and if they cannot do this, they should leave their jobs for their own safety. At least some innocent villagers will be spared.        
	The attack on the Eastern Frontier Rifles (EFR) camp came nearly four months after Maoists, led by a young woman, rode bikes to a police station in Sankrail, in West Midnapore, killed two officers and took the officer-in-charge hostage.        
	A police officer said the rebels took advantage of the weekly haat and came with their arms hidden in pick-up vans. They did not arouse suspicion because on the day of the haat the traffic is very heavy on the road on which the EFR camp stands, the officer said. Also, the Maoists took this opportunity to mingle with the crowds.        
	Sources said the guerrillas first surveyed the camp and then, as the crowds started to thin, struck after being joined by about 20 others on motorcycles. Witnesses said many of the attackers were women.        
	The 50-odd policemen at the camp fired back but soon realised they were hopelessly outnumbered. With casualties mounting, the policemen retreated into the nearby jungles. Till late tonight, 10 of them had returned since the joint forces reached the camp, some 215km from Calcutta. Two policemen, who took bullets in their legs and couldnt escape, pretended to be dead when the Maoists set the tents on fire.        
	Seven injured cops had been shifted to a hospital in Binpur by local people before the police reinforcements arrived.        
	The surprise element also went in favour of the Maoists, said a police officer. Not all the policemen at the camp were on duty and were relaxing. So the suddenness of the attack caught the EFR personnel off guard.        
	Cook Rakesh Lepcha said he was making chapatis when he heard a huge sound. I rushed out of the camp and suddenly found myself facing bullets, Lepcha recalled. I ducked and rushed inside the health centre to protect myself. But then I saw bodies falling and our troops outnumbered. I saw our jawans retreating and knew there was no hope. I quickly scaled the wall at the back of the health centre and escaped.        
	Lepcha then called up the EFR headquarters in Salua, near Kharagpur.         
	Restaurant owner Kartik Karmakar also heard a huge sound  of an exploding improvised device. Then I saw the Maoists  and there just seemed to be too many of them  firing at the camp, Karmakar said. I pulled down the shutters. Some of the women Maoists then came up to us and said not to be scared as innocent villagers wouldnt be harmed.        
	Police sources said the Maoists were armed with sophisticated weapons. They had weapons like Insas and AK rifles. These weapons are normally used by Maoists in Jharkhand. In all probability, they were from that state since Shilda is close to the Jharkhand border.

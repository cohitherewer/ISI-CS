The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Critical, Basu surgery put off
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Critical, Basu surgery put off
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 12: Doctors treating Jyoti Basu have decided to defer a surgery to facilitate breathing that they had planned for tomorrow because his overall health has stayed critical.        
	A doctor said Basu had developed ventricular tachycardia, a critical situation in which heart rhythm is severely disturbed, three days ago. The condition  a doctor said it was a stage before cardiac arrest  was tackled with a defibrillator.         
	 This can recur any time, given his age and general condition, the doctor said.        
	Basu, 95, admitted to a Salt Lake hospital on January 1 with pneumonia, has been on ventilator and inotropic (pressure-stabilising) drugs since January 6.        
	We were planning a tracheostomy but because of some clinical considerations, the medical board unanimously decided to defer it, general and vascular surgeon Krishnendu Mukherjee said.        
	Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure in which a small cut is made in front of the neck and the trachea (windpipe), and a tube is inserted through the trachea to help the patient breathe.        
	The ventilators tube now passes through Basus mouth, but doctors said that if this continued for more than seven to 10 days, there were chances of laryngeal stenosis  a narrowing of the larynx. That can further aggravate breathing. Besides, there is a risk of fresh infection if oral intubation continues, a doctor said.        
	Basu fluttered his eyelids today at times when the sedation was reduced. His urine output was satisfactory and the fever he had yesterday receded, but the bouts of drowsiness continued.         
	Although his organs are responding to treatment at times, their function is fluctuating. There are no persisting signs of improvement and thats a grave concern, a doctor said.        
	The former chief ministers haemoglobin count dropped to 8.6g per 100ml today. A person of his should have haemoglobin levels of at least 12g per 100ml.        
	A doctor said that because of Basus low immunity levels, his antibiotics were changed. He was also administered one unit of blood; another unit will be given tomorrow.        
	Two policemen  Barasat assistant sub-inspector Laxman Tripathi and Doltala constable Nilratan Nandi  donated two units of A+ blood for Basu.        
	A CT scan of Basus brain today revealed that the blood clot that had developed in 2008 when he fell at his home was gone.

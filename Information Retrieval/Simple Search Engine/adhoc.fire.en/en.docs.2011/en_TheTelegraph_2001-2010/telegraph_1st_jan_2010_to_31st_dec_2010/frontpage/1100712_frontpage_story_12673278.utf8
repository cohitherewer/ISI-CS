                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Open to view: UK estate of several scandals
          AMIT ROY                          The estate of Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, the venue of many a sex escapade by John Profumo, a member of Harold MacMillan rsquo;s cabinet, and where former   Pakistan President Ayub Khan relaxed in the swimming pool                                
	London, July 11: The half-a-million or more Indians who now come to the UK every year and drink deep of British culture by taking in a meaningful play, wandering round Westminster Abbey, posing under Big Ben and paying homage to Shakespeare by going to Stratford-upon-Avon can from today add another enriching experience to their must-see list.        
	They can head for Cliveden, the estate in Buckinghamshire, which is offering a scandal tour in celebration of the juiciest political sex drama of the 20th century.        
	There have been several occasions since then when cabinet ministers have been caught with their pants down but all have been tawdry businesses compared with the Profumo affair of 1961.        
	For those who wish to find out more, the National Trust, which now runs Cliveden as a private hotel-cum-tourist attraction, is opening up the estate for 500 a night per couple stay.                                    (From top) Ayub Khan, John Profumo, Christine Keeler when she was 19 and Mandy Rice-Davies      
	During the visit, Profumo expert Rupert Gavin will provide an in-depth debriefing on the events of half-a-century ago when the aristocrats of society were entertained by high class call girls.        
	For Pakistanis, the journey to Cliveden will be of even greater sentimental value. While many other Pakistani Presidents have concerned themselves with such mundane matters as sending over liberation fighters across the LoC into Kashmir, Field Marshal Ayub Khan amused himself by swimming in the pool at Cliveden.        
	Lord Astor, master of Cliveden, introduced a rule intended to ensure the ice was broken quickly between his guests  all had to swim without costumes.        
	This suited Christine Keeler, then 19, and Mandy Rice-Davies, who was even younger, just fine. They were fun-loving teenagers who frolicked in the pool and, it is assumed, elsewhere.         
	The equivalent of 500 in those days might have earned the playful Pakistani President perhaps a polite handshake from Mandy.        
	When the whole case came up in court later, Lord Astor said he hadnt slept with Mandy. Though young enough to be his granddaughter, she put him down with the memorable line: Well, he would, wouldnt he?        
	Profumo, secretary of state for war in Harold MacMillans cabinet, and his upper class set felt that they had the right to help themselves to any filly that caught their fancy. The problem was that Keeler was also apparently sleeping with Yevgeny Eugene Ivanov, a senior naval attach at the Soviet embassy in London.        
	Were the Russians using Keeler to seduce secrets out of Profumo, the papers wanted to know.        
	Profumos big mistake was not so much to sleep with Keeler  upper-class chaps were expected to do that sort of thing even though he had a lovely actress wife by the name of Valerie Hobson  but to tell the House of Commons that he hadnt.        
	Ultimately he had to return to the Commons and admit he had.         
	According to the National Trust, one of the biggest scandals to rock 1960s Britain happened at the Cliveden Estate. This spectacular country estate overlooking the River Thames, open daily for most of the year, was once the glittering hub of society as the home of Waldorf and Nancy Astor.

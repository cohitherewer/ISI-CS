  - Sangh seal on Gadkari, Munda bulldozer operation        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Subterranean differences within the BJP over the formation of a government with the JMM and others were manifest when four top leaders  L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Ananth Kumar  decided to stay away from Arjun Mundas swearing-in in Ranchi on Saturday.        
	Party president Nitin Gadkari was earlier expected to attend the ceremony. His would have been the only high-profile presence in the state capital. However, after his return from Russia, where he went on a study tour, Gadkari is headed for Nagpur to attend tomorrows Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations.         
	Those expected to be there are Rajnath Singh, S.S. Ahluwalia, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Nishikant Dubey and Vijay Goel.        
	BJP sources said Advani and his loyalists were reportedly peeved at Gadkaris unilateralism and the fact that he conducted a solo operation on government formation, this time without as much as informing them and then presenting them with a fait accompli. The party chief, added sources, did not observe the protocol of having his decision ratified by the parliamentary board, the BJPs apex decision-making body.         
	A board member, whos a senior Lok Sabha MP, said, I learnt of the decision through the press. I cant remember another occasion when a development impacting the party has not been endorsed by us.        
	Advani, Sushma and the rest were unhappy with the idea of a second term partnership with the JMM after the unsavoury experience of the first. However, a source close to these leaders could not explain the specific reasons for their discomfiture apart from saying that JMM chief Shibu Soren voted for the UPA in the May vote against the NDA-Left-sponsored motion on the budget.        
	Apparently, their pique had less to do with Soren and more with the choice of Munda for chief ministership. Munda was originally patronised by Gadkaris predecessor, Rajnath and, therefore, fell foul of Advani and his group.        
	In between, when Yashwant Sinhas name started doing the rounds as a prospective chief minister, quite a few in the BJP were convinced that Mundas detractors were behind the exercise although it is well known that unlike Munda, the former finance minister has virtually no following in the legislature party.        
	Gadkari circumvented the niceties of organisational processes, sources said, only because he is armed with the RSSs support.         
	The Sangh wants a friendly government in Jharkhand to help the working of its outfits like Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram and the Ekal vidyalayas, a source said.        
	For the record, spokesman Ramnath Kovind dismissed suggestions of contradictions as media creations. No parliamentary board meeting took place because the party president is abroad, he added.        
	Ravi Shankar Prasad, the chief spokesman, chose the easy way out. Theres only a days notice (for the Ranchi function), so some people are coming and others are not.

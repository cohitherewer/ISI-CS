          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              
	Mumbai, April 26: In former India captain and cricket manager Ravi Shastris opinion, the Indian Premier League (IPL) hasnt been hurt by the controversies of the past fortnight.        
	In my view, Brand IPL remains strong. Its an excellent property. Yes, there are issues to be looked into and thats being done, Shastri, a member of the IPLs governing council, told The Telegraph.        
	Shastri added: At the end of IPL III, last night, cricket alone was the winner. Lalit (Modi) needed to be given a chance to explain and that has been done. He has 15 days to reply (to the chargesheet from the board).        
	Commenting on this mornings governing council meeting, Shastri said: It went off well. The president (Shashank Manohar) has announced whatever needed to be declared. Some cricketing things have to be addressed. That, too, is going to be done.        
	Shastri will soon be off to the West Indies on a World T20 TV assignment.

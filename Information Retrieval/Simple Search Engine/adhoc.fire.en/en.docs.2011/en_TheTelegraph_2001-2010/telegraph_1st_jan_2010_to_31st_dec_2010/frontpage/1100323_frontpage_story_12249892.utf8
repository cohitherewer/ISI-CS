	Ranchi, March 22: A two-day bandh called by Maoists has meant that security forces have been forced to take preventive measures by guarding roads and railways, thereby stalling, albeit temporarily, the offensive against rebels that had gathered momentum across various rebel pockets in Jharkhand.        
	Senior police officers, requesting anonymity, told The Telegraph that the security forces, deployed to run the operation, have had to be diverted because of the bandh.        
	Our priority has changed due to the bandh. Now, the security forces are deployed to safeguard railway tracks, stations and highways, he pointed out.        
	Also, with Ram Navami on March 24, security forces will again be called upon for law and order duty. This means, the flushout operations would gain momentum only after that.        
	DGP Neyaz Ahmed, however, claimed the operations had only been hit partially. It is true that we have diverted some of the forces to safeguard important installations during the bandh, but other forces are running the operations based on intelligence alerts, he said.        
	Maoists have called a bandh in six states, including Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand, and parts of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, against Operation Greenhunt, though the call has been camouflaged to seem people-friendly by having raked up price rise too.         
	As of now, the offensive against rebels has been extended to 11 districts of the state. But security forces are concerned about not having been able to pull off a major arrest which, they feel, would have boosted the morale of the troops.        
	I dont know where they (Maoists) have all gone, said a worried police officer involved in the operations.        
	We have reports that several Maoist cadres have joined the rural work force under NREGA or shifted to urban centres like Ranchi to work as, say, rickshaw drivers in order to evade the police, he added.        
	But senior police officials were satisfied with the combing operations as the forces had managed to venture into areas they had never been before.         
	For example, the police had never visited Kuchai on the border of Ranchi and Seraikela-Kharsawan. It was for the first time that we reached there yesterday, he pointed out.        
	Its true we havent been able get a prized catch but we have become successful in familiarising the troops with the difficult terrain, said CRPF DIG Alok Raj.        
	So, it is giving a psychological advantage to the forces for a long drawn battle, he added.

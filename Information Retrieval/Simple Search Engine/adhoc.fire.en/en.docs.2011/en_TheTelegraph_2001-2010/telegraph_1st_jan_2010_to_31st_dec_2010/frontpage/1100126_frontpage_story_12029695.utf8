The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Win Nobel and hope for Padma

          OUR BUREAU                                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: If you are craving for bragging rights and hoping to make the Padma list next year, be warned: the bar has been raised.        
	You stand a good chance if you have already bagged a Nobel or an Oscar. Such global recognition has propelled Nobel laureate Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and double-Oscar winner A.R. Rahman to Indias customary honour rolls unveiled on the eve of each Republic Day.        
	Ramakrishnan will be given the crown in the Padma pond: the Vibhushan. The crown jewel  the Bharat Ratna which Nobel laureate Amartya Sen was given in 1999  has not been announced yet.         
	Rahman has made the cut for the Bhushan and Resul Pookutty, another Oscar winner, the Padma Shri. Rahman had won the Padma Shri in 2000, the nine-year gap being filled after the 2009 Oscars.         
	If Nobels and Oscars demand too much effort, friends in high places should help. Sant Singh Chatwal, the US-based hotelier who counts Hillary Clinton among his friends, has been nominated for the Bhushan. Not bad for a man who once faced some cases in India. CBI sources today said no cases were pending against him in India.        
	But association with industry beats all other relationships when it comes to picking up a Padma in the time of the economist Prime Minister. During the five years of the Manmohan Singh-led government, the share of the Padma awards bagged by professionals from trade and industry has more than doubled compared with the NDA years.         
	The number of representatives of trade and industry figuring on the list announced today is 14  the highest in this category since the turn of the millennium. Prathap Chandra Reddy, the chairman of the Apollo group of hospitals, will receive the sole Vibhushan in the category.         
	The others in the slot include former RBI chief Y.V. Reddy, K.P. Singh of DLF, Unilevers M.S. Banga, TVS Groups Venu Srinivasan and Leela Groups C.P. Krishnan Nair.        
	Only 12 trade and industry professionals had won the awards between 2000 and 2004 when the NDA reigned in Delhi. But between 2005 and 2009, 28 from this category have bagged the awards.         
	Another surefire criterion  though no patriot will harbour such treasonable ambitions  is an opportunity to operate on the Prime Minister. Ramakant Panda, who treated Manmohan Singh, has been nominated for the Bhushan, just as A.B. Vajpayees doctor Chittaranjan Ranawat was in 2001.        
	Under the category art, Bollywood is a fixture as usual. Aamir Khan, riding high after 3 Idiots, will be given the Bhushan. Before Shah Rukh Khan fans spin conspiracy theories, a sobering titbit of history: Aamir had got the Padma Shri in 2003, two years before Shah Rukh did. So King Khans fans should expect Padma promotion by 2012.        
	Indian journalists cant be faulted if they nurse a sour grapes feeling: the US-based Fareed Zakaria is the sole recipient in the category.

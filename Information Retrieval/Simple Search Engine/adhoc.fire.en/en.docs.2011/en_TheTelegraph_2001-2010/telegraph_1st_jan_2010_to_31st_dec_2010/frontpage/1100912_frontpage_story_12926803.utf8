The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Scrawled at Ground Zero: point and counter-point
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Scrawled at Ground Zero: point and counter-point
  - 9/11 anniversary gestures mirror debate on mosque and Islamophobia in America          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                                
	New York, Sept. 11: On a big white slab of stone rising from the pavement, just in front of the site where the two World Trade Center buildings used to stand tall nine years ago, is pasted an A4-sized printout.        
	Typed on top of the page in bold black font is a half sentence  The Ground Zero Mosque should not be built because:        
	Written under it in capital letters with a pen is the message: It is offensive to those who lost loved ones that day.        
	Just below it, in a different handwriting and in mixed upper and lower cases, is scribbled: I lost my aunt and dont find it offensive.        
	The ninth anniversary of the September 11 attacks here in Lower Manhattan seems less to do with remembering the nearly 3,000 lives lost in the terrorist act than with what America should do about what the supporters of the mosque are calling Islamophobia.        
	Several vertical stone slabs  with NYPD (New York City Police Department) written in blue on their sides  rise from the pavement, each with an A4-sized form pasted on it as part of a survey by concernednewyorkers.com.        
	Xenon light bulbs are beaming two shafts of 887,000-watt light straight into the night sky from a rooftop close to the WTC site to symbolise the Twin Towers, called the Tribute In Light, but it is the little candles burning bright at the next intersection that are causing more noise.        
	The candlelight vigil just yards away from Ground Zero was organised on Friday evening by New York Neighbors for American Values, a conglomeration of more than 100 groups and organisations from the country, which welcomes the effort of Muslim New Yorkers to build institutions that serve their communities and their diverse city.        
	While the WTC site lies almost deserted  its covered on all sides by a makeshift blue wall to screen the 9/11 Memorial work happening inside  the expressions of support around the Park51 project (named after the address of the Islamic Center site) just two blocks away have been the centre of action.         
	Emotions are running strong as everybody who walks by has a yes/no ticked on their mind about the mosque.        
	Tolerance is our only theme, Hansdeep Singh of United Sikhs, one of the groups protesting against the government for not building the mosque, told The Telegraph.                    
	While this is surely happening on the eve of 9/11, we were actually waiting for the period of Ramadan to get over. But yes, its all connected, its all about humanity.        
	Humanity is also the explanation given by many of the Americans who dont want a Muslim place of worship anywhere near the site of what was once referred to as the holy war of Islam.        
	It doesnt sound right, it doesnt feel right, said marketing lady Katelyn, standing near The Cross, a group of steel beams found amid the debris following the September 11 attacks that resembles the proportions of a Christian cross. It has been temporarily relocated to the next block before it is returned to the National September 11 Memorial amp; Museum, expected to open on September 11, 2011.        
	Another New Yorker, Rikki Reich, felt that the voices for and against the Ground Zero Mosque were not balanced.        
	There is one bunch of people who are informed and another who dont know what is happening. Before anybody gives their opinion, they should know the ground realities.        
	Not that everyone in the Big Apple wants to know the arguments for and against the Park51 project. On the subway from Manhattan, Christian, a college-goer from Queens, chuckled with a nonchalant shrug: My birthday is on 9/11 and thats something I cannot change. Mosque or no mosque, I just hope such a day never comes again.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, April 7: Security forces in Jharkhand have stepped up vigil in the districts of Simdega, Gumla, Palamau and Gharwah that share borders with Chhattisgarh as a precautionary measure after yesterdays massacre in Dantewada that left 75 CRPF men and a police guide dead.        
	We are on high alert and have ensured flag marches by the CRPF and district police at several locations including district headquarters. We are checking vehicles coming from Chhattisgarh and have also deployed spies to keep us informed (about possible rebel movement), Gumla SP Narendra Kumar Singh said.         
	The four districts of Simdega, Gumla, Palamau and Gharwah share borders with Chhattisgarhs Jashpur, Ambikapur, Sarguja and Balrampur  all at a distance from Bastar, but the police arent taking any chances.        
	Garhwa SP Richard Lakra said he was in touch with his Ambikapur counterpart. Till now no information of rebel movement have reached us, he said.         
	Simdega SP Durga Oraon said though Dantewada in the south of Chhattisgarh was at least 800 km from Ranchi, they were keeping extra vigil.         
	Palamau SP Anup T Mathew was equally cautious. Forces have been issued fresh alerts and told categorically to stick to standard operating procedures, he said.         
	Seventy-two companies of CRPF have been stationed in Jharkhand for the operations.        
	 CRPF companies are readily available for Palamau, Gumla and Gharwah, but Simdega depends on Gumla for forces.        
	DGP Neyaz Ahmed said they had issued specific instructions to all districts where the operations are on. He, however, he refused to elaborate.

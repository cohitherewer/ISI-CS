                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Campus cry: No politics, please
                                Presidency College. A Telegraph picture                            
	Buddhas panel that will select the vice-chancellor of Presidency University  Amiya Bagchi, Sankar Pal and P.N. Ghosh  has evoked mixed reactions. Heres the buzz at ground zero. Where do you stand? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

	The college appears impressive from outside but alls not well within Presidency. Politics is intrinsically linked to every aspect of the institutions functioning, hampering education.         
	From what I have heard, the entire (search) team is Red-backed. They will possibly select someone with Left connections. Then where is the autonomy? We want someone who is devoid of political connections so that the mechanism of the university remains unhindered.              
	Mohona Maitra         
	first year (history)         
	I am happy that Presidencians are dealing with the selection of the VC. Also, it is very important that we have an Presidencian as the head of the university. But what is even more important is that after Presidency becomes a university, teachers should be carefully selected. There are a large number of qualified Presidencians who can be brought in as teachers. There should be no political influence in the selection of teachers. Only then can quality of education be ensured at the new university.               
	Urbi Patra         
	second year (botany)         
	I am happy with the selection committee and am confident that the members will appoint a deserving candidate as VC of Presidency University.         
	We hope that the VC will ensure the induction of quality teachers, irrespective of whether they are ex-students of the college or not. We also hope that the VC will not change the basic nature of the institution.               
	Souparno Adhikary         
	third year (zoology)        
	I am very pleased with the search committee. Each of them is successful in his field and brings to the panel the right mix of qualities  an administrator, an academician and another who is a mix of both. These are the qualities we want in a VC and the trio will be the right people to judge who is suitable. Also, the selected candidate must be a Presidencian. If the head is someone who knows the uniqueness of the institution, it will make a lot of difference to how the place is run.              
	Tanmay Nattaburman         
	PG-I (botany)         
	We need a VC who knows the college inside out. Presidency has a lot of complications and I feel only a person who has been associated with the institution for a long time can sort things out. A former principal of the college would be a good choice as VC as he would know the pulse of the institution.         
	Once the university starts functioning, students would be greatly benefited if the post-graduate courses being conducted off campus are taught on the College Street campus. We would also request the university administration to reserve seats for home students in PG courses.               
	Kaushik Roy        
	second year (Bengali)        
	Those who have been given the task to select a VC are qualified people who have been undertaking both administrative and academic tasks for a long time. I am sure they will select someone who will ensure that the institution continues to listen to students demands and needs.               
	Bibaswan Basu         
	third year (physiology)         
	The students of Presidency College had been asking for autonomy for a very long time but our pleas fell on deaf ears. Now suddenly we are becoming a university. The decision made us suspicious and now our fears have been confirmed. Even students know that two of the members of the search committee are closely associated with the CPM. They will recruit for the party, defeating the very cause of autonomy. As a student, I want a pure academician as VC who will work for the institution and not toe any party line.              
	Atanu Sinha Roy         
	second year (English)        
	All the three people in the search committee have political connections with the Left. The VC selection process should be completely apolitical. He or she should be purely an academician, not influenced either by Alimuddin Street or Kalighat. For that, if the Presidencian criterion has to be sacrificed then so be it.

          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: The CPM is planning a bid to reclaim Lalgarh sometime next week by marching in from three directions, party leaders in West Midnapore have said.        
	They said that having recaptured Dharampur, Ramgarh and Pirakata in recent weeks and reopening the CPM offices there, the party would use these three places as launch pads for the assault on Lalgarh.        
	Party officials hinted that the armed CPM camps around the three recaptured places would have a key role in the march to Lalgarh but stopped short of saying explicitly whether armed cadres would be used in the operation.        
	They said the party would move into Lalgarh once instructions came from the district CPM leadership. This could be any time after a rally by party youth wing DYFI in Midnapore town on September 15, which will be addressed by central committee member Mohammad Salim and paschimanchal unnayan affairs minister Susanta Ghosh.        
	Lalgarh is the centre point of the Maoist movement in West Midnapore. Reopening our party office there will be a symbolic and moral victory for us and will denote the defeat of the Maoists in this part of Bengal. So it is imperative that we do that very soon, said Anuj Pandey, the CPMs Binpur zonal committee secretary who led the recapture of Dharampur early this month.        
	District intelligence sources said some of the armed CPM camps were in Pidrakuli, Pingboni, Kadashole, Harina, Dherua, Manbandhi, Pathri, Kalshibhanga and Buripal.        
	There are several camps dotted around these three recaptured places, a CPM leader said. We cannot afford to take any chances in this phase of our move towards Lalgarh.        
	CPM leaders said that once the marchers reached Lalgarh they would not face any problems in reopening their party office and holding processions.        
	Lalgarh itself is not a problem. The presence of the joint forces is so strong there that the Maoists would not dare attack or confront us, a CPM leader said. But we are likely to face resistance as we pass through the Jhitka, Khasjangal and Bamal forests.        
	A CPM leader said the party would have a back-up force to deal with any Maoist attack on the way to Lalgarh. He, however, would not say whether this force would be made up of armed cadres, or whether the marchers would be carrying arms.        
	But a party cadre from one of the armed camps near Dharampur said: We will be fully prepared to take on the armed might of the Maoists. We will fight back tooth and nail if they dare attack us on our way to Lalgarh.        
	District intelligence sources hinted that the CPM cadres firepower now matched that of the Maoists and could even be more sophisticated. We are monitoring the situation, an official said.        
	It was while trying to inspect the armed camps that seven journalists, including The Telegraphs principal correspondent Pronab Mondal and photographer Amit Datta, got beaten up by CPM cadres at Buripal, barely a kilometre from Pirakata.        
	Mondal, whose left arm was fractured, saw one such fortified camp while being escorted out of the area by CPM cadres.        
	The Buripal primary school had been converted into a fortress by the CPM, Mondal said. There were sandbags all around it, huge fluorescent lamps were in place, and armed cadres were stationed at all corners of the building.        
	In mid-June last year, armed rebels and activists of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities had demolished portions of the CPM office in Lalgarh and made a bonfire of the furniture. Since then, no one has ventured inside the office.

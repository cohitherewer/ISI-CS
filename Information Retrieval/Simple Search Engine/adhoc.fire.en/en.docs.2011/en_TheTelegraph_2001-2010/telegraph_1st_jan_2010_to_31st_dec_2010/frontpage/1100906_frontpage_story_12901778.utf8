  - Former Test player gives graphic account of how he was offered cash to facilitate byes           SCYLD BERRY                      The News of the World has quoted Pakistan batsman Yasir Hameed (in AFP picture) as saying that his teammates were involved in fixing ldquo;almost every match rdquo;. Hameed denied he had made the remarks                                
	London, Sept. 5: A former Test player has given a graphic and exclusive account of how easily international cricketers can be signed up by illegal bookmakers. For most cricket followers it is, simply, shocking.         
	We were in a five-star team hotel in Pakistan the day before an international game, says the former player, and I got a knock on the door of my room from two girls posing as autograph-hunters.        
	They were Pakistani girls dressed in western clothes  normal clothes, nothing obscene.        
	The rest of the former Test players version in his own words:        
	I had turned my back as I walked back into the middle of my room, and was saying how are you or something like that, when all of a sudden a bloke appears and I thought: Wheres he come from?        
	I guess the girls hadnt shut the door properly and had let him come in.        
	The girls moved aside and the man said: Im here to make you an offer on behalf of an interested party.        
	I said: What do you mean? You get these sorts of people hanging round team hotels  they might want to know how much your bat sponsor gives you and make you a better offer, or something like that.        
	The next thing I can remember him saying was: We can give you $10,000.        
	What for? I asked. He said: For letting four byes go off the first ball of the game tomorrow.        
	What do you mean? I said.        
	Its very simple, the man replied. All you have to do is let the ball go for four byes. We can give you the money now.        
	Then he threw the money down on the table  $10,000. He was a portly type of chap and just took the money out of his jacket. The girls were still standing there, as if they had seen it all before.                    
	I said: Im sorry, I cant do this. He said: Okay. Heres another 10,000. And he put another bundle down on the table.        
	By now Im looking at the girls and Im looking at the man and Im scratching my head and thinking: Theres something not quite right here. So I said: I cant do this, Im very sorry but can you leave my room?        
	He said: Well, we can make it better for you. We can make you happy  or words to that effect.        
	What do you mean? I asked.        
	Gifts, he said. Women.        
	I didnt even touch his money. I just looked at it and said: Im really not interested. Can you leave?        
	He put the money back in his pocket and said: We can talk to you another time. Other people are doing it, so why dont you?        
	The man and the two girls left together. He didnt seem very happy and he raised his voice when he said: Other people are doing it, so why dont you?        
	The next morning, our opening bowler ran in for the first over and his first ball went down the leg-side. I proceeded to stop it  as wicketkeepers are supposed to do.        
	I have seen exactly this same sort of approach made to other players in their hotel rooms. But the only other time I was approached was outside the Pearl Continental in Karachi the day before a One-day International.        
	There were two or three of us standing outside, waiting to go to a party at Clifton Beach. A youngish chap in his twenties  fairly well dressed  came up and said: Salaam Alaikum, can I ask you a quick question?        
	So I said: Alaikum salaam, what is it?        
	The chap said: Whos the twelfth man tomorrow?        
	Whys that then? I asked.        
	Well, theres $5,000 waiting for you, he replied.        
	I laughed at him and said: One, I dont know as we havent had the team meeting and two, I wouldnt tell you.        
	Later that evening, I told a friend who was in the team, and he said I should have told him at the time because he would have thumped him.

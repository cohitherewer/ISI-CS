	Jaipur, Sept. 9: Their erstwhile subjects marry early but Rajasthans GeNext royals dont mind waiting till they are 30 or even on the wrong side of it to tie the knot.        
	On November 18, Jodhpurs crown prince, 35-year-old Shivraj Singh, will tie the knot with princess Gayatri of Askot, Uttaranchal.        
	Shivraj, who was educated at Eton and Oxford and was Indias poster boy in the polo circuit till five years ago, suffered a near-fatal accident during a match in 2005. Sources said his long-drawn recovery from serious head injuries delayed his marriage.        
	Before the accident, Shivraj had trained with banks abroad and had started taking on the reins of the familys hospitality interests.        
	Maharaja Gaj Singhs only son is, however, not the only young royal to have dabbled in the familys heritage hotel properties.        
	In Udaipurs Mewar family, princess Padmaja Kumari has become the managing director of the HRH hotel chain. Like Shivraj, she is well travelled and has trained abroad  for two years at the Four Seasons hotel in New York. She, too, will marry, but next March. The 30-year-old prinesss match  Kunwar Kush Singhji Parmar of Gujarat.        
	Unlike the princess, in Rajasthan, 68 per cent of girls get married before they turn 15, and 52 per cent have their first pregnancy between 15 and19, according to a recent survey done by an NGO.        
	Sources say one reason why the young royals are marrying late nowadays is because it is difficult to find the right match. Jodhpur and Udapiur are among the richest royal families in the country.        
	Sociologist Gopal Bharadwaj of JNV University, Jodhpur, said: The trend is the impact of time. Earlier in royal families, the marriage decision was taken by the grandfather. Even the father was insignificant. But now, with modernisation, good education, entrepreneurial skills, more business and political acumen, this generation takes decisions themselves.        
	Bharadwaj added: This generation of royals is careerist, they do not want to take the risk of banking only on their huge ancestral property, jewellery and treasures but want to increase the wealth.        
	Most of the young royals are in the hospitality business. Some also run family trusts and have set up elite schools and take care of the palaces and museums. Many others smell power in politics, such as Bikaners princess Siddhi Kumari, who is 37, single and a painter. She is now a first-time legislator in Rajasthan.        
	Observers say the enormous wealth of the Rajasthan royals, perhaps, deters most suitors. There is also the added burden of finding the right caste and clan and an equally wealthy royal family.        
	In the earlier feudal system, princes, maharajas usually married early  sometimes three or four times. Jaipur Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II had three wives, the most famous among them being the late Gayatri Devi.         
	In the Jodhpur royal family, Shivrajs great-grandfather Umaid Singh got married before he was 20. His son Hanwant Singhs first marriage was also before 20.        
	Gaj Singh tied the knot when he was 25.         
	Gayatri Devi, who hailed from Cooch Behar in Bengal, met Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II when she was 12 and married him in 1940, when she was 21.        
	Her grandchildren Lalitya Kumari, 31, and Devraj Singh, 29, have no immediate plans of marrying, sources said, as they are more involved in the legal hassles surrounding the Rajmatas Rs 1,000-crore property.

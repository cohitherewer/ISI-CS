	San Bruno (California), Sept. 10 (AP): Firefighters poured water on flaming and smouldering wreckage early today after a huge explosion sent blazes roaring through a neighbourhood in the hills south of San Francisco, killing four people, destroying more than 50 homes and damaging dozens of others.        
	Last nights explosion shot a fireball more than 305 meters in the air and sent frightened residents fleeing for safety and rushing to get belongings out of burning homes, witnesses said.        
	Utility officials said a gas line ruptured in the vicinity of the blast, which left a giant crater and sent flames tearing across several suburban blocks in San Bruno.        
	Victims with serious burns began arriving at San Francisco Bay area hospitals shortly after the blast. An estimate of the number of injured was not immediately available. Hospitals reported receiving about 20 injured patients and they anticipated getting more.        
	Its going to take us until at least until tomorrow into the afternoon to do a full search, Haag said        
	Resident Connie Bushman returned home to find her block was on fire. She said she ran into her house looking for her 80-year-old father but could not find him. A firefighter told her he had left, but she had not been able to track him down. I dont know where my father is, I dont know where my husband is, I dont know where to go, Bushman said.        
	After the initial blast, flames reached as high as 30 meters as the fire fuelled itself on burning homes.

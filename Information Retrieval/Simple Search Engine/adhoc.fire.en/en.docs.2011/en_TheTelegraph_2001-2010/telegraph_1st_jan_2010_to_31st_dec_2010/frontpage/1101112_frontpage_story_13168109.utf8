	Nov. 11: Sonia Gandhi today put an arm around Mamata Banerjee and led her away to discuss the amended land acquisition bill, but sources said the railway minister avoided any promises about supporting the legislation.        
	Mamata had earlier skipped a meeting with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, called to sort out differences over the bill, on October 25 despite being in Delhi.        
	Today, Sonia apparently tried to persuade the Trinamul Congress chief to agree to the bill being introduced in the current session  a commitment given by the Prime Minister to Rahul Gandhi.        
	Mamata, however, feels that Nandigram and Singur are still live issues in Bengal and wants the bill put on ice till next years Assembly polls, her party sources said. Mamata is against any government intervention in land acquisition but the draft of the bill proposes a minority role.        
	The bill has been listed for introduction in the winter session. Sources in Delhi said the Congress had promised Mamata that after its introduction, the bill would be referred to a standing committee that would ensure it did not come up for passage before the Bengal polls.        
	Speaking to reporters after meeting Sonia, the Trinamul chief tried to evade the subject of land. All political issues (relating to Bengal), including the state-sponsored terrorism being unleashed by the CPM, were discussed, she said.        
	Trinamul sources in Calcutta said the discussions had touched on the land bill, which says that if private investors can buy 70 per cent of the land directly, the government can acquire the balance 30 per cent for them. Mamata is against any government role.        
	There was talk in Congress circles that their high command would not consult Didi on the land bill any more (after she skipped the Pranab meeting). But we have been informed they met today and briefly discussed the legislation, a Trinamul general secretary said.        
	Didi made her stand known: that land-losers interests must be protected and jobs given to affected families, and that she was not in favour of any government role in land acquisition for private purposes.        
	Mamata apparently told Sonia that land-losers should be given a certain area of developed land near the private project built on their plots. We have been told she spoke to Soniaji about the need to include this in the proposed bill, a source said.        
	Eyewitnesses said Sonias eagerness to talk to Mamata was visible. Immediately after the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day, the Congress president put an arm around Mamata and walked to the Central Hall chatting with her. They later met in Sonias room in the complex.        
	The Trinamul chief later said: I have had very good personal relations with her for a very long time.        
	Trinamul sources said that at the meeting, Mamata had repeated her demand for the withdrawal of the joint forces from Jungle Mahal and lobbied for early polls in Bengal.        
	Mamata, who returned to Calcutta in the evening, was among many passengers held up at Delhi airport.

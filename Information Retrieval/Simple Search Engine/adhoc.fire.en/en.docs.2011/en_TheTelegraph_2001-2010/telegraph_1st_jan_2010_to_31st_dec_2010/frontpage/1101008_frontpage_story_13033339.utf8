  - Mamata, Karat to speak at Cambridge three days apart          J.P. YADAV                            Mamata Banerjee and   Prakash Karat                                
	Oct. 7: After Singur and Jungle Mahal, the battle between Mamata Banerjee and the Left is set for its international debut: at the hallowed, 800-year-old precincts of Cambridge University.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and the Trinamul Congress chief are scheduled to speak later this month at the university that taught Jawaharlal Nehru, Jagadish Chandra Bose and Amartya Sen.        
	While Karats topic touches on Left politics in India, Mamatas will include her own rise in politics, which has come at the cost of the Left in its citadel of Bengal.        
	Such sworn opponents can lead to sparks flying  even on a soft October evening and even at Cambridge, as had happened 64 years ago at a celebrated meeting of three leading philosophers of the time at the Cambridge Moral Science Club in Kings College.        
	Ludwig Wittgenstein had reportedly pulled a poker out of the fireplace and brandished it while glowering at Karl Popper, only to storm out as referee Bertrand Russell furiously admonished him.        
	Like Mamata and Karat, the duelling philosophers were compatriots (both were Austrian-born) and the date of their ill-fated debate was October 25, the day Mamata is to deliver her lecture.        
	Those fearing a repeat can rest assured. Not only is Indian politicians discourse known to be more cultured than that of philosophers, but Karat and Mamata will be speaking three days apart.        
	On October 22, Karat is scheduled to speak on Victor Kiernan and the Left in India at a conference organised in honour of Victor Gordon Kiernan (1913-2009), a British Marxist historian and the CPM bosss teacher at Edinburgh University in the 1960s.        
	The title of the conference, Lessons of Empire  a Past and Present Conference in Honour of V.G. Kiernan, will be close to the heart of the western-educated Karat who is prone to see the evil hand of imperialism everywhere.              
	Bengals home-grown Didi will arrive on October 25 evening to inaugurate a new wing of the universitys political science department and address the topic of The Rising Power.        
	Invited as Indias railway minister, her subject will primarily be the countrys rise as an economic power, but sources close to her confirmed she would speak also on her own rise in Bengal.        
	Mamata will arrive in London on October 23 night  its likely that by then Karat would be on his way back. According to the official schedule, she will check in at Hotel Bentley in central London. The following day, she will attend a programme at Hampstead to mark 150 years of Rabindranath Tagore.        
	Before boarding the flight home on October 26 night, Mamata will meet Britains transport minister, representatives from the London Corporation, and investors and financers before enjoying a cruise on the Thames. The idea behind the cruise, sources said, is to help Mamata learn how to achieve her dream project of turning Calcutta into London.        
	I shall visit the Thames riverfront and the London Bridge, and hold discussions with the British government on the beautification projects being implemented in London, Mamata had told reporters at her home last month while announcing her Cambridge trip. Sources said Calcutta mayor Sovan Chatterjee will accompany her but not as part of her official team  Sovan has an invitation from the Harrow Council, a local body in London.        
	Its providence that brings Karat and Mamata to Cambridge at almost the same time. An aide of the Trinamul chief said the invite to her had come nearly a year ago. But she could not make it because of her preoccupations in Bengal and Delhi. She made up her mind only in August.        
	When she was told, while leaving a party programme today, that Karat would be visiting Cambridge virtually at the same time, a grim-faced Mamata walked off without replying. Karat was not available for comment on the near-coincidence of their Cambridge trips.        
	The Kiernan conference is being organised by the Centre for South Asian Studies. Karat will speak at Cormack Room, University Centre, in the evening. Karats affection for Kiernan, who clearly shaped his ideas, was reflected in a short article he wrote last year after the death of his teacher.        
	I was fortunate to have been a student of his. The bond between us was strengthened by his India connection. I last met him in September 2008, a few days after his 95th birthday. He was cheerful, and asked about developments in India, Karat wrote.        
	Having spent eight years in India (1938-46), he was in close touch with the fledgling Communist Party and became a friend of P.C. Joshi, who was general secretary of the party.        
	Mamata may be glad to know that among the speakers will be another Marxist historian, Eric Hobsbawm, an interview by whom earlier this year had spawned a controversy over whether Karat had told him the CPM is expected to do very badly in the 2011 Bengal elections.        
	The other speakers will include Jayati Ghosh of JNU and Vijay Prasad of Trinity College. Prasad will speak on Marxists at the Margins, not a bad description of where Marxists are in todays western society.        
	Even new Labour Party chief Ed Miliband, dubbed Red Ed because of his dependence on the hard Left trade unions, has had to distance himself from his late Marxist father, the academic Ralph Miliband.        
	Karat will attract a polite audience but in the real world outside, the accepted philosophy is better described as Better Dead than Red.        
	What precisely Mamatas philosophy is she will have to explain when she comes. Cambridge is waiting.                    INPUTS FROM BARUN GHOSH AND AMIT ROY

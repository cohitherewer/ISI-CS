          PINAKI MAJUMDAR                                     
	Jamshedpur, July 18: A rattled CRPF brass has ordered two separate inquiries into Friday nights mayhem at Kuchai camp in Seraikela-Kharsawan district that left seven dead.         
	CRPF director-general Vikram Srivastava directed DIG Bhanu Pratap Singh to initiate a probe and submit a report in the next three days. The DIG in turn also ordered an inquiry, which has to be completed within a month.         
	Sources said initial investigations revealed that head constable Harpinder Singh, who sprayed bullets from his AK-47 assault rifle to fell six colleagues before being shot himself, had been dogged by family problems for some time.         
	He appeared stressed and lost his cool often. Lack of proper infrastructure at the camp and hectic schedules may have added to his aggression, said a CRPF officer at the camp, who is also part of the probe team.         
	The officer said the Kuchai camp lacks basic facilities like proper toilets, and there is only one hand-pump for 900 jawans. Often the jawans are greeted by power cuts when they return from gruelling field operations. The personnel cover long distances on foot wearing bullet proof fatigues in the heat during anti-insurgency operations in the dense forests of Seraikela and Kharsawan.         
	Shahnawaz Khan, CRPF commandant of the 196th Battalion, of which Harpinder was part of, said in most cases, jawans resort to aggression when denied leave. However, it was not the case with Harpinder as he had returned from a short vacation to his native Amritsar on June 18 and he had also not asked for further leave, Khan said, adding that investigations would make things clearer.        
	DIG Bhanu Pratap Singh confirmed that two separate probes had been ordered. Such incidents are rare. The inquiries will help establish the truth, he said.        
	Meanwhile, the Seraikela-Kharsawan police confirmed that an FIR had been lodged in connection with the shootout. An FIR was lodged at the Kuchai police station on the basis of a statement given by a senior officer of the camp late last night, said superintendent of police Abhishek.         
	According to him, CRPF sub-inspector Bandhu Oraon, who was injured in the shootout, was out of danger and was recuperating at the Tata Main Hospital in Jamshedpur.         
	The CRPFs 196th Battalion camp was set-up at Kuchai, about 60km from here in 2002 to counter Maoist insurgency in the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Seats vacant, roof full
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Seats vacant, roof full
                                      
	Nearly 6,000 of the 16,500 tickets were not sold for the one-day international between India and New Zealand in Guwahati on Sunday. But that did not mean a dearth of spectators when India won the match by 40 runs.         
	An under-construction building near the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium offered a vantage view, and its roof was crammed with freeloader fans (AP picture top). The buildings owner, senior citizen Mujibur Rahman, said later: The invasion happened while I was away. I heard one smart fellow even charged Rs 5 or Rs 10 for each spectator.                     
	A dog also became an unwitting freeloader, prancing around stand-in skipper Gautam Gambhir (in PTI picture right) and Suresh Raina. The street pooch had been cornered and chased into the stadium by some youngsters who had to wait outside the gates because they had no tickets.

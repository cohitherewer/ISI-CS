Trains were also stopped by protestors at Nangloi, Shakur Basti and Badli railway stations.  
	At the NSC Bose International Airport, only Air India operated its flights since morning. Five domestic flight including Kolkata-Delhi and Kolkata-Mumbai had taken off besides the Kolkata-Singapore international flight. However, private airlines did not operate their flights, airport sources said. Around 46 departure flights and 40 arrival planes were cancelled in Mumbai airport due to the day long Bandh.   
	The roads all over wore a deserted look in the absence of any traffic. No public buses were plying and roads wore a deserted look. Government offices remained closed as the shutdown turned out to be a government-sponsored strike.Shops and most of the markets were closed. Local Passenger trains	were stranded and blocked in many parts of Kolkata. The same picture is also vailable from Mumbai, where local trains were blocked in Borivali.  
	The bandh took a violent form in Mumbai, with Bandh supporters pelting stones at the vehicles in the areas including Worli, Mahim, Vakola and Mulund. The trains have been overcrowded since taxis and autos are not plying in Mumbai. Road traffic got badly affected in Mumbai.  
	About 800 bandh supporters were arrested in Orissa, including BJP state unit president Jual Oram and senior leaders Suresh Pujari and P Harichandan were arrested while picketing at different places to enforce the bandh.  
	Normal life was thrown out of gear today in Bihar due to the nation-wide strike called by NDA and Left parties to protest the fuel price hike, while 3,500 supporters including senior leaders were taken into preventive custody. Leaders included BJP General Secretary Ravishankar Prasad, Vice-President, Kiran Ghai, state party chief Dr C P Thakur, besides JD(U)'s state president Vijay Kumar Chowdhary, its national spokesperson Shivanand Tiwari and Rajya Sabha member Upendra Kushwaha, official sources said.  
	While the Bandh was almost successful in most parts of the country, Congress today dubbed it as rdquo;complete flop rdquo;. They accused both Left parties and NDA of engaging in ldquo;sensationalism rdquo; over the issue of fuel price hike.  
	 rdquo;Except for the state-sponsored initiatives in certain states where they are in power, there has been a complete flop, complete negative reaction against the bandh, rdquo; party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi told reporters in Delhi.

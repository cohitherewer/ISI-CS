          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, March 23: Thousands of ornamental fish are waiting to die in rows of aquariums at the factory of Rani tea estate which was vandalised by a mob yesterday.        
	The rampage was triggered after the proprietor of the estate, Mridul Kumar Bhattacharjee, opened fire on a group of villagers who went to his bungalow to protest the assault on a woman in the morning.         
	A schoolboy was killed and four others were injured in the shooting.         
	With no power, the supply of oxygen to these aquariums has snapped. Several aquariums were broken in the attack, killing hundreds of fish. There is no way the fish can be saved, a security man said.         
	Power supply was snapped after the mob set cables ablaze yesterday.         
	Two stray dogs were seen feeding on dry fish  used to feed the ornamental fish  inside the hall where the aquariums are kept.         
	All the fish are now destined to perish in the aquariums in the dark hall.         
	We are trying to restore power to light up the boundary of the factory and the bungalow for security reasons but we can hardly do much to restore power inside the factory. Most of the power cables have been burnt, the securityman said.         
	A posse of security personnel has been deployed in the area.         
	Apart from the organic tea product factory, Rani estate also has a piggery and a dairy.         
	The Institute of Marketology based in Switzerland certified Rani tea as organic in 2005.         
	A source in the tea industry said the estate is the only garden in the country to have a captive power plant and a mini-hydel unit. The estate also has an extensive network of fisheries with 23 acres under aqua cultivation.         
	The top floor of the factory was used to rear ornamental fish and perhaps it is the largest such ornamental fish rearing centre in the state, a tea planter close to Bhattacharjee said.         
	He said Bhattacharjee supplied ornamental fish not only to outlets in the region but also to other states.         
	Ornamental fish is his next big business after tea, he said.

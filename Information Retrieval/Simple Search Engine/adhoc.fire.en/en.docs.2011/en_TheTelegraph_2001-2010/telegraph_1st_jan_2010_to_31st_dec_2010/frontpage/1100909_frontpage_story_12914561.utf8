The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | I support govt, but not unholy deals
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                I support govt, but not unholy deals
          VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR                            Yashwant Sinha                                  
	Hazaribagh, Sept. 8: Yashwant Sinha may have been kept out of the loop by the BJP central leadership even as party general secretary Arjun Munda opened up behind-the-scenes negotiations with the JMM, but the Hazaribagh MP claims he is not against the formation of a government in Jharkhand.        
	I told our leadership to make everything clear to our allies so that we arent blackmailed again, he told The Telegraph in an exclusive interview at his sprawling bungalow, Rishab Vatica, in Demotand in Hazaribagh. Excerpts.              
	You are unhappy the BJP is about to form a government.        
	I dont know who is spreading such baseless things. I will fully support and co-operate with this government.              
	All senior leaders were in Ranchi yesterday. But, your absence made a statement.         
	No. Its not so. Arjun Munda called me yesterday to invite me to Ranchi. But I had already started touring my constituency, something I had planned before. So, it wasnt possible for me to reach Raj Bhavan in time.               
	Did you play a role in the negotiations?        
	Past experience made me cautious. I told our leadership to make everything clear to our allies so that we arent blackmailed again. I am in favour of forming a government, but not through unholy commitments to our partners. Now, we have the numbers. The ball is in the governors court.              
	Many say you were lobbying for the top job.        
	This is baseless. I was an IAS before coming into politics. I resigned when I had 12 years of service left. I have never bargained or lobbied for any post. In V.P Singhs government, I refused to become a minister. Atal Behari Vajpayee made me finance minister in his government not because of any lobby, but due to my abilities. Saying that I am a suitable candidate for this post is another thing. But making me a strong contender eyeing the chair is not right.               
	Will this government succeed?        
	Three months of Presidents rule have led the BJP and others to acquire a better understanding. This time, all are serious about forming a government which will definitely complete its tenure.        
	Youre touring?        
	My tours have made me realise that there is a serious disconnect between the administration and farmers. The state is subsidising seeds and funding five tubewells in panchayats. But villagers didnt know.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Obama to shuffle his team

	Washington, Dec. 24: President Obama is planning the first major reorganisation of his administration, preparing to shuffle several positions in the West Wing as he tries to fortify his political team for the realities of divided government.         
	The President is studying how to maximise the power of the executive branch, advisers said, seeking insight from veterans of previous administrations and fresh advice from business leaders to guide the second half of his term.         
	He is reviewing the restructuring plan during the holidays, aides said, and intends to make the first announcements in the January.         
	A reshaping of the economic team, beginning by naming a new director of the National Economic Council, is among the most urgent priorities of the new year. Gene Sperling, a counsellor to the treasury secretary who held the position in the Clinton administration, is among the final contenders to succeed Lawrence H. Summers in the job, along with Roger C. Altman, a Wall Street investment banker.         
	When Republicans assume control of the House on January 5, ending four years of a full Democratic majority in Congress, the Presidents approach to policy and politics is poised to change on several fronts. The White House is hiring more lawyers to handle oversight investigations from the new Congress, even as the President sets up a re-election headquarters in Chicago and considers ways to streamline operations inside the West Wing.         
	Youre not going to see wholesale changes, but there will be significant changes. I think thats desirable, said David Axelrod, a senior adviser who is leaving the White House next month.         
	This is a bubble. Its been an intense couple of years, and theres an advantage to bringing in folks who have a fresh set of senses  smell, touch and feel  about whats going on out there.         
	The first personnel change inside the White House is the arrival of David Plouffe, who managed Obamas presidential campaign. For the last two years, Plouffe has been one of the Presidents closest outside confidants, but he is set to replace Axelrod as his chief political adviser, with a broad portfolio.         
	Jim Messina, a deputy White House chief of staff, will depart early next year to manage the re-election campaign in Chicago. His departure, along with those of others inside the West Wing, has created vacancies among the Presidents top echelon of advisers that are at the heart of the reorganisation plan.

	Feb. 4: A police jeep and two buses were set on fire in the Darjeeling hills late in the evening, an hour after cops dispersed a group of Gorkha Janmukti Vidyarthi Morcha members with batons while they were on fast in Siliguri demanding permission for a public meeting.         
	The windscreen of a prison van was also damaged along with a private bus in Kalimpong, where a night guard and a constable were bashed up by the arsonists.         
	Gorkha Janmukti Morcha Morcha vice-president Pradip Pradhan said no government vehicles including those of the police would be allowed to ply in the hills from tomorrow till an inquiry was conducted on the lathicharge in the plains.         
	In Darjeeling, the Vidyarthi Morcha confined the district magistrate to his office from 3.30pm after he refused permission for a public meeting in the plains. The confinement is indefinite, the student wing of the Morcha said. It was continuing well past midnight. Late in the evening, the supporters of the hill party laid siege to the police stations in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Kurseong and Bijanbari.         
	The situation at the fast site in Siliguris Darjeeling More turned tense at 7.30pm with the arrival of members of the Bangla Bangla Bhasha Banchao Committee, an outfit opposed to the Morcha demand for a separate state.         
	Forces from Pradhannagar and Matigara police stations and personnel of the district commando force soon cordoned them off near the statue of Tenzing Norgay, 50 metres from where around 60 Vidyarthi Morcha supporters were sitting with the seven fasting members. The Vidyarthi Morcha refused to withdraw the hunger strike till the police chased them with batons.         
	The police arrested 22 Morcha supporters and eight members of the Bhasha Banchao Committee. After midnight, the gherao at the Kurseong police station was lifted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Air India flight touches down near halfway mark 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Air India flight touches down near halfway mark 
          OUR BUREAU                                        Smoke cloaks the wreckage of IX 812 in the valley into which the Boeing 737-800 plunged and burst into flames in Mangalore on Saturday. (PTI picture)       
	May 22: An Air India Express flight from Dubai overshot the hilltop runway at Mangalores Bajpe airport today, fell onto a wooded valley some 200 metres below and burst into flames, killing 158 people including 23 children and babies.        
	Indias third-worst air crash, and its first major one in a decade, left behind suspicions of pilot error at one of the countrys most picturesque but trickiest airports, its tabletop runways precariously perched atop a plateau with their ends dropping off into thick-green gorges.        
	Eight passengers survived the 6.05am accident almost miraculously, jumping out through a crack in the fuselage as Flight IX 812 hit a concrete navigational aid called a localiser at the end of the runway and broke into two.        
	We had no hope to survive, but we survived, G.K. Pradeep, an Indian technician employed in Dubai, said.        
	Some others among the 160 passengers and six crew members may have leapt into the fire, stoked by aviation fuel gushing out of the wings, as they tried to clamber out through the same hole.        
	Airport sources said the Boeing 737-800s 53-year-old pilot Zlatko Glusica, a British national of Serbian origin, had 10,200 hours of flying experience but apparently miscalculated the landing threshold and brought the plane down too late.        
	Instead of landing within the first 1,000-1,300 feet of the 8,300ft-long runway, he touched down almost near the halfway mark although the visibility was a healthy 6km, the sources said. The aircraft lost control on the dry, concrete runway, a burst tyre worsening matters if some of the survivors are right.        
	There had been no distress signal from the pilot although one survivor mentioned turbulence before landing. Veteran pilots suspect that Glusica probably braked hard instead of attempting a go around  that is, take off at once, gain enough height and approach once more to land correctly.        
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel, whose offer to resign was rejected by the Prime Minister, refused to blame the runways design. Officials said that since the airport was opened in 2006, it had witnessed over 32,000 landings.        
	The conditions were ideal for landing with good visibility and the runways friction coefficient also appeared in order, Patel said.        
	He said Glusica had flown in and out of Bajpe at least 19 times, the last time being May 17, and co-pilot H.S. Ahluwaliah, a Mangalorean, had done at least 66 takeoffs and landings there.        
	The Centre cancelled a dinner to have been hosted in New Delhi tonight by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to mark the UPA II governments first anniversary.        
	Todays aviation disaster is the first in India since rising middle-class demand fuelled an explosion in air traffic over the past decade. Aviation safety experts, though, have repeatedly sounded warnings about the countrys airlines, airports and regulations, raising concern whether Indias creaking infrastructure was failing to keep pace with the economic boom.        
	Last year, there were three near-collisions between planes in Mumbai and in September, an Air India flight to Toronto was delayed 11 hours while staff searched for rats inside the plane. The incidents come at a time the national carrier  Air India Express is its budget arm  has been making huge losses.        
	All the passengers were Indians, officials said. Sixty of the dead were Malayalis, mostly migrant workers in the Gulf, and 38 of them came from north Keralas Kasargod, which counts Mangalore as its nearest airport. With several governments and agencies offering compensation, the family of each of the dead stands to receive Rs 76 lakh.         
	At the crash site, workers pulled scores of burnt bodies from the blackened tangle of aircraft cables, twisted metal, charred trees and mud. Many of the dead were strapped to their seats, their bodies charred beyond recognition. Their relatives, who had come to the airport to welcome them, stood around weeping.        
	Accidents of this kind, known as runway excursions, are fairly common but todays led to tragedy because of the tabletop runway, experts said.        
	The world aviation body has urged all airports to build 1,000ft-long safety extensions at the end of each runway. Those with little room for extension have been advised to install soft ground layers  known as arrestor beds  to slow planes.         
	The Mangalore runway has a spillover area of only 300ft to slow overshooting planes, and there are conflicting claims whether it is a bed of sand.        
	The plane was two-and-a-half years old, having made its first flight in December 2007. The 737-800 has been involved in five fatal accidents since entering service in 1998.The last major crash in India occurred on July 17, 2000, when an Alliance Air Boeing ploughed into a Patna neighbourhood, killing 60. The deadliest plane disaster in India took place in November 1996, when a mid-air collision involving foreign airlines killed 349.  
	Your   Questions  
	Was the runway too short?  
	 No. The Mangalore runway is shorter than Calcutta rsquo;s primary strip but was sufficient for the Boeing 737-800. Mangalore rsquo;s ldquo;tabletop rdquo; makes landing tough but so do Kochi and Leh  
	 Why did the plane overshoot?  
	 Unclear. The plane may have come in   too fast or landed too far down the runway to slow down in time. Almost no crash is caused by a single factor  
	Are there safe seats in planes?   
								 No data to say which seats are safer. Survivors are usually those who get thrown out of aircraft that break up on, or very close to, the ground or those who are farthest from the smoke or fire  
								 How safe is air travel?  
	 The odds of being killed on a single   flight is 1 in 92 lakh with the top   25 airlines and 1 in 8.44 lakh with the   bottom 25 airlines

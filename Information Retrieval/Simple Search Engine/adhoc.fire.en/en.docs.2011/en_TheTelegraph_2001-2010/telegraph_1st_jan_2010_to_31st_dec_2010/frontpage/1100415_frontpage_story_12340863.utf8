	Bokaro, April 14: Villagers tipped off security forces who arrested four hardcore Maoists, including a 30-year-old woman involved in the 2007 Maoist attack on a CRPF camp in Khasmahal that killed four jawans.        
	Bokaro SP Saket Singh presented the four to the media today and revealed that with yesterdays arrest, pulled off by a team of district police from Bokaro, Hazaribagh and Giridih, the security forces had busted a plot by the rebels to hold meetings in various villages and threaten residents into launching a public campaign against Operation Greenhunt.        
	Those arrested today were the commander and secretary of the South Dumri zone Maoist womens wing, Shobha Marandi, alias Subhashini; the 35-year-old area zonal secretary, Shiv Charan Manjhi, 24-year-old Talo Manjhi and a sharpshooter, Vijay Kumar Ravidas, who joined the rebels two years ago.        
	The two Manjhis and Ravidas operated out of Vishnugarh in Hazaribagh district, while Shobha was from Pirtand in Giridih.        
	The SP said more than 14 cases were pending against them.         
	The arms seized from the arrested rebels included six bombs, one double barrel gun, two pistols, 190 pieces of grenade striker, three wireless sets, seven pieces of cartridges of different bores, 12 magazine pouches and two revolver covers.        
	Two mobile phones, Maoist banners, a diary and two motorcycles were also recovered from them.        
	Shobha, who is a divorcee, was in charge of the womens wing whose brief was to lure young, impressionable girls into the rebel fold to be used by the Maoist leadership as messengers and arms carriers, the police said.        
	On April 7, 2007, Shobha led a team of armed Naxalites posing as poor village women, and attacked the CRPF camp at Khasmahal. In all six persons, including four jawans, were killed.        
	More than 200 policemen and CRPF jawans searched the jungles of Degagadha-Giniato of Uparghat from where they ultimately picked up the rebels.

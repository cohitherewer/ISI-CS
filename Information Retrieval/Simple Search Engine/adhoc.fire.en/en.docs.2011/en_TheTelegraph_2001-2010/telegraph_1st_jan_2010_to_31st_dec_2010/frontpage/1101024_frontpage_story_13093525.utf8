          A.S.R.P. MUKESH                              
	Ranchi, Oct. 23: On its way out, the monsoon is trying to make up for its poor show with late bursts of showers that are proving to be beneficial for rabi and vegetable production in drought-hit Jharkhand.        
	So, if the rain deficit doomed kharif cultivation this year, agricultural experts believe the present showers in Ranchi and adjacent areas, coupled with the late rains of September, has led to ideal conditions for rabi and vegetable cultivation much before its usual schedule.        
	There is moisture in soil due to late rains. Also, the temperature has dipped by a few centigrades as a result of which conditions have become ideal for wheat and vegetable cultivation, said Sunil Kumar, director, agriculture.        
	Compared to last year, the agriculture department expects rabi cultivation to be spread over 5,10,000 hectare this year.        
	Last year, it was 4.7 lakh hectare but this year we will cross the 5 lakh mark, said Kumar, adding that his department had distributed rabi crop seeds to farmers across districts a month ago.        
	So far, Jharkhand has received 645mm rainfall against an average of 1,300 mm  a 43 per cent dip in rainfall this year during peak season.        
	But, now farmers can make up part of their losses by cultivating vegetables and rabi crops.        
	R.P. Singh, director, soil conservation agrees, saying that even if Jharkhand was experiencing drought, the state had some advantages compared to neighbouring Orissa and Bihar.        
	The state supports vegetable cultivation throughout the year. Tomato, cauliflower, cabbage or potato are best suited for upland areas. Sarson (mustard), tomato, chana, matar if sown now, can help farmers battling drought, said Singh.        
	Also, as opposed to paddy, rabi or vegetables required minimum investment.        
	According to a Birsa Agriculture University estimation, based on scientists field visits, this year, around 9 lakh hectare remained vacant out of 16.7 lakh hectare, against last years 7 lakh hectare.        
	These are mostly farmers who banked on rice and other paddy crops and are now suffering due to scanty rainfall, said B.N. Singh, director, research, BAU.        
	For rabi, especially wheat, sowing starts mid-October. And as rabi and vegetables need less water, experts expect a bumper harvest in the next two months.

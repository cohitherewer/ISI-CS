	Ranchi, Aug. 10: Governor M..H. Farook today dismissed five deputy superintendents of police, who were illegally favoured for appointment via the second (2007-08) civil service examinations conducted by the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC).        
	A notification issued by the state home department said the five had been sacked with immediate effect. They are Radha Prem Kishore, Harihar Singh Munda, Ravi Kumar Kujur, Mukesh Kumar Mahto and Shivendra.        
	These officers are among the 19 who were recalled from their postings after the state ordered the vigilance bureau on June 9 to lodge an FIR against the chairman and three former members of JPSC for grave irregularities, forgery, interpolation and fraud in conducting the exams. Of them, nine deputy collectors have already been sacked. The remaining five under the scanner are Kundan Kumar Singh, Mausmi Nagesh, Sangeeta Kumari, Kumar Shailendra and Manoj Nath Shahdeo.

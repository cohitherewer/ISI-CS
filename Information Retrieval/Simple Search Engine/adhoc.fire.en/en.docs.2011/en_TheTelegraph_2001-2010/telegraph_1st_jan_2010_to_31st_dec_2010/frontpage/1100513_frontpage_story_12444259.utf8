	Gros Islet (St Lucia), May 12: The Rodney Bay Marina here and Park Street back in Calcutta have much in common. Both, for example, happen to be happening places. Restaurants, pubs.... Pick, choose and have a blast.         
	For the last couple of days, most (particularly Razmataz) had been packed with fans of Team India. From other parts of the Caribbean, the US, Canada and some from all the way home, too.         
	Theyd been upbeat on Monday night, but the mood was distinctly sour after Indias exit from the World Twenty20 yesterday.        
	So much so that, at one Bay address, around 9 last night, a group of fans even threatened to beat up the Indian cricketers, should any of them decide to show up there.        
	Nobody did, till about 9.30pm.        
	Perhaps, theyd gone overboard with alcohol, but even the absolutely sober fans were outraged. The spark just wasnt there, nor were there moments of brilliance, except Suresh Rainas century against South Africa and a couple of great last overs from Ashish Nehra.        
	For those whod been present during the 2007 World Cup, this was their second disappointment in three years. Then, India didnt get past even round No. 1.        
	Champions in the inaugural edition, in 2007, Mahendra Singh Dhonis men failed to get past the Super Eights both last year and now.                
	Despite the poor show (losing all three matches in the Super Eights), Dhoni maintained that he had a very good team. Only, his players hadnt performed to potential.        
	Basically, Dhonis message was that their best wasnt good enough. But is that a good enough explanation?         
	Again, Dhoni didnt agree that the six-week IPL, immediately before the World Twenty20, had left the players fatigued both physically and in the mind.        
	No big party-goer himself, Dhoni did make the point that players needed to respect their body. He may have been alluding to senior pro Yuvraj Singh, one of the failures (14 runs in the Super Eights), when he said: If youll party after a match and travel the next morning, then that will take its toll. Its up to individuals.        
	The post-match parties wont be there from next year, but the IPL will be bigger. So, expect more to end up like Virender Sehwag.        
	Dhoni didnt talk about it, but persisting with Ravindra Jadeja after hed been hammered by Australia will go down as a capital blunder. Clearly, Dhoni also needed to be flexible, a case in point being Yusuf Pathans position in the batting order.        
	Being fearless is the key to success in T20, yet the Indians approach was anything but that. Actually, its quite simple: the more the inhibitions, the lesser the chances of succeeding.        
	 Whats a bit strange is that the bounce at the Kensington Oval, in Bridgetown, really did India in. Surely, our batsmen have done well in Australia and in South Africa. But, yes, we didnt have a Sachin Tendulkar or a Rahul Dravid around.        
	Dhoni was brutally frank. Most of us batsmen have a problem with that (short-pitched deliveries). We dont have bouncy wickets and dont have bowlers (in domestic cricket) who bowl at 145kmph. We have a problem and Im not ashamed of saying that we dont play the short-pitched bowling well.        
	Gary Kirsten, therefore, has much work to do.        
	Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja, in a chat with The Telegraph, summed it up thus: Indias exit is a bit of a shock. On paper, you had the team to go the distance. T20 fatigue could be a factor. Then, technical shortcomings got exposed.         
	Of the Big Three from the subcontinent, holders Pakistan and Sri Lanka have made the semi-final, so thats more salt into Indias wounds.        
	The seniors have a months break, though many may argue its not well-deserved, but the Rainas will soon be heading to Zimbabwe.        
	According to manager Ranjib Biswal, the entire team leaves for home early tomorrow (IST), via London and Dubai.        
	Footnote: Poor Umesh Yadav. Named Praveen Kumars replacement, he was all set to leave for the West Indies yesterday but was asked not to make the trip.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Good day in office... on the greens!
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Good day in office... on the greens!
          DAY 1 - BIRDIE BUZZ                                        Day One action at KKN presents The Telegraph Cup Golf 2010 at RCGC. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)				                                 
	Brandon de Souza of Tiger Sports Marketing pens a diary for Metro on KKN presents The Telegraph Cup Golf 2010 in association with Senbo and Ballantines, at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club.        
	Weather        
	There was enough of a cloud cover not to make it too hot.        
	Early birds        
	To wake us (golfers) up at the crack of dawn is a chore. Amazingly, at quarter to six today, there were 40 people ready to play though the official time was 6.20am. Why? Because nothing can stop them from this game.        
	Big bite        
	Everybody was trying to have extra nourishment at the 9th hole not realising that a full belly is worse when youre trying to make a swing.        
	But I can assure you, that everyone who played today had a very hearty breakfast. There were eggs, baked beans, sausages, even simple sandwiches, vegetable cutlets and the rest.        
	Nerve-racking        
	Nervous? All of them. The number of people who froze on the first tee was unparalleled. They were tense because they thought everyones watching  and especially their bosses!        
	Last-minute prep        
	You know when we used to study for our exams, and right till the last minute we kept reading, thinking that that last minute might help, so people who hadnt  or had hardly  worked on their game suddenly believed that just practising before they go off to putt today, was actually going to help them. The last time these people were probably asked to touch their toes, they lifted their feet and touched their toes! So, suddenly practising because they thought it would be gods way of saying youll play well, son was interesting to watch.        
	All dressed up        
	At Wimbledon you can wear only white. On the golf course you normally wear simple trousers or long shorts with a collared shirt. But given the colours on display, the fashion designers should shift focus to the glamour on the greens for some real inspiration.        
	Some looked like theyd dressed in the dark because of the combinations they came in! Golfers wore the wildest colours  magentas, pinks, greens, oranges. Dont ask me why. But it was all very visible, very vibrant.        
	And more importantly they matched their shoes, if you please, and their gloves. Gone are the days when women matched their handbags and their hats (remember the races?). The golfers are trying to be, er, as prim and propah!        
	Fun format        
	The beautiful thing about the format is if youre 0 to 6, youre allowed to convert one of your worst holes to par. From 7 to 15, you can change two holes, and from 16 you can take out your three worst holes.        
	Where are the WAGs?        
	They didnt come. Probably happy to get their peace and quiet with the husbands away. Expect to see more 19th hole action on the last two days.        
	Highlight        
	The toast of the day was Aditya Khaitan from Williamson Magor (A). He recorded a fantastic round of 67. He missed out last time and so they were really hurting about losing the Cup to Madhya Bharat Papers Ltd. Hes come out with a very strong statement today. Apart from the fact that hes a fine golfer himself, Im sure he felt like it was a good day at the office.        
	A few others played so well, that I was almost hoping they had day jobs.        
	Young gun        
	Watch out for Vedant Jaitha, an upcoming young player.              
	19th hole        
	At the end of Day 1, all the golfers were very enthused because this is one score their bosses are going to look out for. Some good camaraderie at the end, a few people sat around, had a couple of beers at the 19th hole, enjoying their day off. As I always tell people, you dont feel guilty being at the golf course on a working day. Not during these four days of the year at The Telegraph Golf Cup 2010.              
	Last laugh        
	Two things you never ask a golfer are his age and his waistline. When they need to make their trousers for the game, the secretaries ask them, Sir, whats your waist, and the bosses say 40 even though its 42. And then they want to know why the trousers dont fit!        
	(As told to Karo Christine Kumar)

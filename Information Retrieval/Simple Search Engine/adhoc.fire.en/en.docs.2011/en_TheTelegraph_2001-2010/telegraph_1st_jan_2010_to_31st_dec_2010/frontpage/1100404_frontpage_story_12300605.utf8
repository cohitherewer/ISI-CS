	Shillong, April 3: The Centre, after redefining education as a fundamental right, is looking at increasing the gross enrolment ratio in higher education from the present dismal 12.4 per cent to 30 per cent by 2020.         
	Addressing the first convocation of Rajiv Gandhi Indian Institute of Management (RGIIM) here this morning, Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said to achieve the 30 per cent enrolment ratio in higher education, there was a need to have additional infrastructure and increased capacities in higher education system.         
	This will require effective partnerships with all stakeholders and collaborative efforts, Mukherjee said.        
	According to him, there is a need to create an architecture in education that allows access and inclusion without diluting the quality.        
	The first batch of 63 IIM students, including four from Assam  Abhijit Boro, Kantha Bhuvan Das, Pranab Jyoti Talukdar and Saugat Das  who have successfully completed the two-year post-graduate diploma in management were conferred degrees today. All the 63 also got placements in the corporate sector.        
	The finance minister said that as skill development was a key factor for the economic and social growth of the country, the Prime Ministers Council on National Skill Development had laid down the core governing principles for operating strategies for skill development.        
	The council had a mission of creating 50 crore skilled people by 2022, he added.        
	According to Mukherjee, with the expansion of the economy, there was an increase in demand for skilled and adequate human resources. What is required is to empower the youth with appropriate skills and seize the opportunities at the domestic and international levels, he said.        
	On other means of improving human resources, Mukherjee said the Centre had set up the National Knowledge Commission in 2005 to guide policy and direct reforms, focusing on key areas like education, science and technology, agriculture, industry and e-governance.        
	The easy access to knowledge, creation and preservation of knowledge systems, dissemination of knowledge and better knowledge services are other core concerns of the commission, he said.        
	Touching on the present position of the Indian economy, Mukherjee said the Indian economy has weathered the global economic crisis well and is in a far better position than it was a year ago.        
	However, he said one of the challenges before the Indian economy is to quickly revert to the high GDP growth path of 9 per cent per annum.        
	The second challenge is to harness the economic growth to consolidate the recent gains in making development more inclusive in the fields of rural development, to strengthen food security, improve education opportunities and provide health facilities, Mukherjee said.        
	The Union minister also said that the third challenge is to improve the public delivery system. The system of governance must work towards economic empowerment and make growth human-specific, he added.        
	Praising the RGIIM, Mukherjee said the institute was making efforts to provide an educational framework that would have sustainable management education as the core thrust area.        
	He also said there was a need to alleviate poverty and ensure that the benefits of growth and development percolate down to every section of society.        
	The decision of RGIIM to set up a Centre for the Development of Northeast Region is one such step. The Centre seeks to ensure that local communities imbibe the best management practices and become partners in Indias economic growth and success story, Mukherjee said.        
	He also praised the institute for its stress on research and development activities.        
	Research combined with extension activities can help in nation building by facilitating the benefits of sound technical education to reach more people, he said.        
	The director of the RGIIM, Ashoke Dutta, said its aim was creation of an institution of excellence having a national character while also considering the needs and aspirations of the people of the Northeast.

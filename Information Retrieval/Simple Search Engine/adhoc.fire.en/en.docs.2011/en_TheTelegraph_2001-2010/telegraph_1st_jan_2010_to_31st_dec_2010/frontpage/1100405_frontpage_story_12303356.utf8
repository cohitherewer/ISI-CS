                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Nikaah a dhokha, says Shoaib 
  - FIR registered after ayesha complains of bribe and threat          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                      Shoaib Malik outside Sania Mirza rsquo;s house in Hyderabad on Sunday. (PTI)                                
	Hyderabad, April 4: Shoaib Malik today accepted in public that he had signed a nikaahnaama with Ayesha Siddiqui but appeared to suggest he didnt need to formally divorce her because he had been cheated into signing it with wrong photographs.        
	A qazi here claimed the nikaahnaama was illegal but cited a different reason. He said a nikaahnaama must be signed either in the brides country or the grooms, but claimed that Ayesha was in Sharjah when she signed it.        
	Hyderabad police, however, registered an FIR against Shoaib after Ayesha complained that he was alternately using threats and bribe offers to try and get her to withdraw the case she had lodged against him yesterday.        
	Additional commissioner of police Tirumala Rao said a case and an FIR had been registered against Shoaib under sections dealing with cheating, domestic violence and criminal intimidation.        
	We are seeking legal advice whether we should confiscate his passport, Rao said.        
	Shoaib, who took journalists questions and also handed them a two-page statement, said: My nikaah over the phone with Ayesha was a dhokha (fraud). How can there be a divorce for a dhokhe ki nikaah?        
	He said he had been shown the photograph of an unknown woman and told she was Ayesha, and that when he came to India to meet her, the real Ayesha introduced herself as Maha apa, the elder sister of Ayesha.        
	Now they are asking for a divorce. To begin with, there was no nikaah because they pressured me into it with the intention to cheat. In Islam, there can only be a divorce if the nikaah is valid, the Pakistani cricketer said.                  Sania Mirza      
	Shoaib, who appeared before the media with his bodyguards in front of Sania Mirzas home, where he had been holed up since his arrival on Friday night, confirmed his wedding would take place in Hyderabad on April 15. I am here for the wedding  my first wedding, he said.        
	In Lahore, a Pakistani barrister hired by Ayeshas family said he would file a case against the cricketer within a few days.        
	Shoaib said it was through an accident that he realised that Maha and Ayesha were the same woman.        
	It was the worst moment of my life. It happened in August 2005. My brother-in-law got a photograph of a teacher in Saudi Arabia who was telling people she was married to me, Shoaib said. The woman in it (the picture) was the person I called Maha apa. I immediately confronted Maha apa. I told her I didnt want to speak to her again.        
	Shoaib said he did think about releasing the pictures he had received from Ayesha. I told Ayesha I was going to release the pictures to (the) media. She apologised and (said) the other girl was married and it would ruin her life. I thought about it. Whosoever is in that photograph probably doesnt even know about all this and it would not be fair to release those pictures.        
	Shoaib said that after his lawyer sent a notice to Ayeshas father M.A. Siddiqui in 2008, he stopped making allegations but resumed it once the news of his marriage with Sania became public.        
	Ayesha claims Maha is her second name.         
	Friends and relatives trooped in and out of the Mirza home through the day. The mehendi ritual is to take place either tomorrow morning or on Tuesday.        
	They (the couple) have almost decided on the menu and the decorations. A Delhi-based decorator has been hired to do the interiors of the banquet hall at Taj Krishna, said Anil Yadav, a friend who met Sania and Shoaib last evening. They are getting their wedding dresses done up at Jaipur, Mumbai and London.        
	The designers may be flown down to Hyderabad to save time, sources said. Next week, the Mirzas are likely to fly to Mumbai to buy jewellery.        
	Taj Krishna hotel sources said cooks would be brought from Peshawar and Rawalpindi for the banquet, for which the best linen and cutlery would be chosen from the Nizams collection at Falaknuma Palace.        
	Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has wished the couple a happy married life although the juicy news about his previous relationship will do him no good.        
	Whatever the facts are, I would like to wish Sania Mirza and Shoaib a good life together, Akram, who recently lost his wife, wrote in a column for ESPN.

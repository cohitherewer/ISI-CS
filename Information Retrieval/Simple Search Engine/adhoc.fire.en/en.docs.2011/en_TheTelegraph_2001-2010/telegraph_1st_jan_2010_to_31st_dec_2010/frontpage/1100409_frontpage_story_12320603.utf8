The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | House votes to curb Zardaris powers
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                House votes to curb Zardaris powers
          NASIR JAFFRY                            Zardari                                  
	Islamabad, April 8: Pakistans political forces wrote a new chapter in the countrys nascent parliamentary history by approving a landmark package of constitutional reforms, stripping President Asif Ali Zardari of sweeping powers and handing them back to Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani.        
	The package, known as 18th amendment bill, reversed infamous changes made in the constitution by former military dictator Pervez Musharraf to prolong his rule and gag his opponents.        
	With the adoption of the bill by the National Assembly, the Senate or the upper house will also have to pass it before President Zardari signs it into a law.        
	The 18th amendment will take away Presidents powers to dissolve the National Assembly, dismiss a Prime Minister and appoint chiefs of the powerful armed forces. It also deleted name of another military dictator Zia-ul Haq from the Constitution. Haq, who had been killed in an aircrash in August 1988, had sent Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to the gallows under what Pakistan Peoples Party calls politically motivated charges in 1979 two years after overthrowing his government in 1977.        
	A constitutional reforms committee had finalised the bill with full support from the oppositions Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), Pakistan Muslim League(Q), a former ally of Musharraf and other parties in the parliament.        
	The process to push through the draft bill from the two Houses of the parliament has been set into motion at a time when Pakistan Peoples Party government, of which President Zardari is the co-chairman faces pressure from the Supreme Court for implementation of its judgement on notorious National Reconciliation Ordinance, which granted amensty to Zardari and hundreds of other politicians from graft charges.        
	The apex court had struck down the NRO as illegal, which Musharraf had promulgated as part of a power-sharing deal with opposition leader and former Prime MInister Benazir Bhutto in October 2007. But she had been killed in a gun and suicide attack during an election rally in the garrison town of Rawalpindi in December same year.        
	The court has also directed the government to re-open money laundering cases against Zardari in Switzerland, which had been closed under the NRO.         
	The apex court on Thursday directed the government to submit to it a progress report on April 5 on the re-opening of the Swiss cases.        
	The Swiss government shelved a probe into alleged money laundering against Zardari and his late wife, Benazir Bhutto, more than two years ago after the then attorney general Malik Mohammad Qayyum sent a formal request in this regard.        
	Bhutto and Zardari allegedly used the Swiss bank accounts to launder about $12 million in bribes paid by different companies seeking contracts for customs inspection in Pakistan in the 1990s.        
	Political analysts believe that the 18th amendment bill would subside pressure on the PPP government as Zardaris status will reduce merely to a figurehead.        
	Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani declared that the country had now embarked on a journey to bolster parliamentary democracy, as members from the treasury and Opposition benches in the lower House thumped their desks and shouted slogans of Hang Musharraf.        
	The North West Frontier Province (NWFP) has been renamed Khyber PakhtoonKhwa, a long- standing demand of the people of province, rife with Taliban and Al Qaida-linked militancy.

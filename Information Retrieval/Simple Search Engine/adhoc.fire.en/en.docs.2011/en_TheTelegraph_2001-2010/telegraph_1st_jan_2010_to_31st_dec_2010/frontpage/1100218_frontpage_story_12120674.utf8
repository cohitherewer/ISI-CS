	New Delhi, Feb. 17: Constitutional courts can order a CBI investigation into a serious offence without the consent of the state government concerned but such extraordinary power must be used sparingly, cautiously and in exceptional circumstances, the Supreme Court ruled today.        
	The Supreme Court and high courts are constitutional courts, which means they can take up cases dealing with the fundamental rights.        
	The verdict addresses one of the most contentious issues that followed the Nandigram police firing when Calcutta High Court ordered a CBI probe without consulting the state government.        
	However, the ruling did not specify the circumstances that warrant a court-ordered CBI probe, opening up the possibility of states litigating every time such an investigation is ordered without their consent.        
	At first glance, todays ruling by a five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan appears to have gone against the state governments stand. However, the riders arm the government with the option of returning to the high court or the Supreme Court with the plea that the cases concerned did not warrant the description of being exceptional.        
	Bengal law minister Rabilal Moitra today said the state government was pleased with the Supreme Court judgment, saying it would restrain high courts from ordering CBI probes in all and sundry cases and restrict them to the deserving ones. ( )        
	State Trinamul Congress president Subrata Bakshi said the ruling would bring justice to a lot of people, especially those in Nandigram.        
	The Supreme Court judgment came on the 10-year-old Chhoto Angaria case in which it was alleged that 11 Trinamul workers were massacred by CPM supporters. Calcutta High Court had ordered a CBI probe into the case in 2001.        
	The Supreme Court today said: Being protectors of civil liberties of its citizens, this court and high courts have not only the power and jurisdiction but also an obligation to protect the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution zealously and vigilantly.        
	 The doctrine of separation of powers cannot curtail the power of judicial review of constitutional courts in situations where fundamental rights were being violated, the court said.         
	The bench cautioned that this extraordinary power must be exercised sparingly, cautiously and in exceptional circumstances where it becomes necessary to provide credibility and instil confidence in investigations or where the incident may have national and international ramifications or where (it is) necessary for doing complete justice.        
	However, the court said no inflexible guidelines could be laid down on when such power should be exercised. In other words, the court decided on a general principle of law but left individual cases to benches hearing them.        
	The court said high courts would have to weigh evidence before deciding if a case could be made out for a CBI probe. The bench said the CBI shouldnt be flooded with cases.         
	Technically, Calcutta High Courts decision to hand over the probe into the March 2007 Nandigram firing to the CBI could be opposed by the Bengal government. Even the Chhoto Angaria massacre case  on which the judgment was delivered  will now go back to a Supreme Court regular bench. This bench will decide whether the CBI probe was warranted.        
	The alleged massacre kicked up a storm in Bengal but its occurrence itself was a matter of dispute because no bodies could be found.        
	Todays judgment will also impact several other cases, such as the 2002 Gujarat riot trials.

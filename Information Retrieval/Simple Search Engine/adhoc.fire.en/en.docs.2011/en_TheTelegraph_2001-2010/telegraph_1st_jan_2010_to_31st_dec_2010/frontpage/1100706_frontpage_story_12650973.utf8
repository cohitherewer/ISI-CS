  - Semi-final pits the youngest against the oldest                                  
	The Old and the New: Uruguay against the Netherlands. First World Cup-winners against Never World Cup-winners. Cape Towns dramatic Greenpoint stadium stages an opening semi-final which speaks all about revolutions of different eras.        
	In 1930, as hosts, Uruguay approached the inaugural World Cup as pioneers of a new style of high-technique football which had earned them the Olympic Games gold  the original, de facto, world title  in both 1924 and 1928. They represented the avant-garde, the brave new world of football; they lifted the crown in 1930 and again in 1950.        
	In 1974, as neighbours to hosts West Germany, the Netherlands approached the 10th World Cup as high priests of an evolutionary total football system which was a precursor to the high-fitness, high-tempo game of today; they finished as runners-up, undermined at the very last by their own arrogance.        
	Uruguay are the oldest of the four semi-finalists, having been there at the start; the Netherlands are the youngest.        
	In 1974 and 1978, they reached the final itself via a mini-leagues system which did not provide for knockout semi-finals; so the first time they took on the mental challenge of knowing they were one do-or-die game from the final was in 1998 when they fell to Brazil.        
	This weeks second semi-final, in Durbans magnificent Moses Mabhida stadium on Wednesday, matches Germany (first-time semi-finalists in 1934) against Spain (last-four participants in 1930).                        Wesley Sneijder and Diego Forlan      
	As for the Cape Town conundrum, the truth is that the Netherlands were always dangerous outsiders with a last-four potential while Uruguay were rank outsiders.         
	The Dutch remain favourites to edge through but not easily even though the Uruguayans will be weakened by injuries and suspensions.                          
	Impressive left back Jorge Fucile is suspended along with striker Luis Suarez who is lucky to be out for only one game after his match-overturning handball against Ghana in the quarter-finals. Anchorman captain and centre back Diego Lugano is doubtful with a knee injury and midfielder Nicolas Lodeiro is absent with a foot fracture.        
	Missing the duel with the Dutch is an added blow for Suarez and Lodeiro since both play their club football with Ajax Amsterdam who provide three members of the Dutch squad.        
	Uruguays Diego Forlan has been outstanding all through the finals: an honest, hard-working, relentless footballer in the manner and application of David Beckham, his one-time Manchester United team-mate in the days when Forlan could barely hit the back of the net for love nor money.        
	He was released by United in the end because, though his fans adored his industry, 17 goals in 98 appearances was not the sort of attacking return demanded by manager Sir Alex Ferguson.        
	Forlan has scored three goals at these finals but Uruguay, altogether, only seven in five games.         
	Their only consolation is that the Dutch have been only marginally more efficient, scoring nine times, and it is playmaker Wesley Sneijder who is their four-goal top scorer rather than one of their strikers; Arsenals Robin van Persie, perhaps suffering the same just-back-to-fitness problem as Spains Fernando Torres, has but one goal to his name.        
	The context points to a low-scoring game, even extra-time and perhaps penalties once more. Here the few scraps of evidence might just point to Uruguay reaching their first final in 60 years: they came through with only one miss against Ghana while the Netherlands elite history is littered with shootout surrenders.        
	The Dutch in 1998, for example, were the last team to lose a semi-final in a penalty shootout.

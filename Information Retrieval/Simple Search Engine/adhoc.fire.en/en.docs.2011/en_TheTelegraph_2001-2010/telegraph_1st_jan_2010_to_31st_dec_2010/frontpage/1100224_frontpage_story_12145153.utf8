          OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES                                        A man tries to fight his way through smoke and grab a piece of cloth tied to a window sill on a burning floor of Carlton Towers in Bangalore.

	Bangalore, Feb. 23: Flames engulfed a plush address on one of Bangalores myriad software corridors, killing nine persons, at least three of whom had jumped out of windows to escape the smoke that had filled their offices.         
	At least 50 people have received burn injuries in the fire that broke out at the seven-storey Carlton Towers on Airport Road. The building houses many firms, including software companies such as Wipro, and a Thank God Its Friday restaurant on the ground floor.        
	Three persons died of injuries after jumping from the top floors of the building while six succumbed to severe burns and asphyxiation, said sources at Manipal Hospital, where those affected were rushed. Unconfirmed reports said at least eight of those who died had jumped out in panic.        
	The dead have been identified as Savitha, Benzi Kumar, Rajesh Subramanyam, Surabhi Joshi, Purohit Madan Singh, Sunil Iyer, Fayaz Pasha, Akhil Uday and Siddarth Padam. All of them are professionals below 35.        
	Around 1,500 people work in Carlton Towers, said a Wipro employee who is part of a small unit of the software firm located in the building. The property comprises two separate buildings and the fire was restricted to only one.        
	High-end restaurants Bombay Post and TGIF, located at the building, were empty at the time of the blaze as it was their post-lunch break.        
	The fire, probably caused by a short circuit in the afternoon, began in a duct through which cables were laid. The smoke apparently travelled up through the ducts and filled the building whose sixth and seventh floors were the worst affected.        
	Scores of panic-stricken people, many of them young professionals, started screaming for help and ran helter-skelter. One girl clad in a blue salwar kameez landed on the roof of the portico after jumping from the sixth floor and then slipped to the ground. Her condition was not immediately known.        
	Another woman tried to use her sari as a rope to get out. According to an eyewitness account and cellphone video recordings, a woman who tried to escape by lowering herself with a long cloth into the next floor, lost balance and came tumbling down from the upper floors.        
	We heard the fire alarm and started breaking all the windows, said Anand, who works at a software firm on the sixth floor.         
	At least 16 fire tenders were rushed to the building in batches to douse the flames, which took about two hours to tame.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Delhi reopens Dow liability
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Delhi reopens Dow liability
  - Fresh look at deal to buy Carbide         JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                              
	New Delhi, June 13: The government will examine the deal under which Dow Chemical bought Union Carbide to see if Dow can be allowed to shrug off financial responsibility for cleaning up Bhopals environment.        
	We will have to examine the nature of the purchase agreement by which Dow Chemical bought over Union Carbide and see whether it absolves them of financial liability for Bhopal, said Salman Khursheed, corporate affairs minister.         
	In an interview to The Telegraph, Khursheed said if Dow had legally protected or indemnified itself against the liabilities of Carbide, it might be able to wriggle out.         
	In principle, as a lawyer, I dont think Dow Chemical may be held responsible for the liability. A successors liability depends on the arrangement under which the transaction has taken place.         
	The minister, however, added the analogy of a buyer of a house (who) cannot escape paying an electricity bill left unpaid by claiming he was unaware of the bill.         
	Implicit in the statement is the indication that Dow would have to pay the dues that Carbide would have borne, if the purchase agreement did not protect it from past liabilities.         
	He said the government might have considered blocking the sale of Union Carbide to Dow till its dues were settled, but I dont know which official was dealing with this matter then and what actually transpired.         
	The $45-billion (sales in 2009) Dow Chemical Company has set aside $2.2 billion to address future asbestos-related liabilities arising out of the Union Carbide acquisition. However, the US multinationals stand has been that it is not liable for Bhopal-related liabilities as Union Carbide had sold all its shares in Union Carbide India Ltd in 1994, seven years before Dow bought Carbide.         
	The Congress-led government has decided to refer to a group of ministers the issue of who will pay for cleaning up Bhopals air and groundwater pollution caused by the 1984 gas leak.        
	Khursheed said his ministry might also consider a law to enforce civil liability for major industrial disasters. We will look at fixing of criminal liability in the case of such disasters but that has to be done carefully.        
	This is the second group of ministers on the issue. The earlier one, led by Arjun Singh and formed during the tenure of the last UPA government, hardly held any meetings.         
	The new group will consider legal advice as well as a note prepared by the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers that argued against letting Dow walk away without paying for the clean-up.        
	It took the stand that courts of law should fix corporate responsibility and whichever company was considered a successor of Union Carbide should be asked to pay. It argued that since Dow had bought Union Carbide for $9.3 billion in 2001, under Indian corporate law it would be responsible as the successor for cleaning up the environment.         
	A proposal by Ratan Tata to organise a corporate clean-up was not found acceptable by the ministry, which represents the government in all legal cases related to the gas tragedy, as it went against the principle of making the successor pay.         
	Tata, who is also co-chair of the Indo-US CEO Forum, of which Dow president Andrew N. Liveris is a member, had proposed a corpus to be established jointly by Indian and US companies to clean up the site.         
	In response to a public interest litigation, Madhya Pradesh High Court had a few years ago ordered Dow to deposit Rs 100 crore to clean up the toxic waste and contamination in and around the factory.        
	The court wanted the chemical giant to clear some 70 tonnes of poisonous residue, which had contaminated the soil and groundwater at Carbides pesticides plant and penetrated vegetation and animal tissues in the surrounding area. There are also demands to compensate about 20,000 people who have suffered health damage from exposure to contaminants in their drinking water and food.

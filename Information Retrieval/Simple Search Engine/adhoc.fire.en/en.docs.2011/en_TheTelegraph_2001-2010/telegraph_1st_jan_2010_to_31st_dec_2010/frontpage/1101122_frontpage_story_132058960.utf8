	Guangzhou, Nov 22 (PTI): The Indian trio of Rahul Banerjee, Mangal Singh Champia and Jayanta Talukdar held their nerves to beat Chinese Taipei and clinch the men's team bronze in the Archery competition of the Asian Games here today.
    Banerjee, Champia and Talukdar defeated the Chinese Taipei team of Cheng Wei Kuo, Chia Chun
    Sung and Kang Tien 220-216 in the bronze medal match.
    This was India's second archery medal at the ongoing Games after the women's team too settled for the third place yesterday at the Aoti Archery Range.
    The men today started their campaign by beating Bangladesh 221-186. The next round was also a cakewalk as they beat Nepal 221-194 before losing to Korea 216-222 in the semifinal match.
    In the bronze medal match, the Indians took the upperhand by scoring 57 against Taipei's 52 in the first set but the balance tilted in the third set.

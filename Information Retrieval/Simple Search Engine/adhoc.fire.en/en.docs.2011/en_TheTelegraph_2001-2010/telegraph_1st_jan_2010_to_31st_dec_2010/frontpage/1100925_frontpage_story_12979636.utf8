The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Jinxed sports meet to miss December date
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Jinxed sports meet to miss December date
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Sept. 24: The 34th National Games is staring at its sixth postponement in three years.         
	Chief Secretary A.K. Singh has said it is not possible to hold the sporting meet from December 9. The state government will consult with the Indian Olympic Association and announce fresh dates, he said, talking to reporters late this evening.         
	Singh pointed out that the vigilance bureau was probing into grave financial irregularities in purchase of sports equipment and the Games could not be held before investigations were over.         
	Let the probe be completed first, he added.         
	Yesterday, upset over the Arjun Munda governments alleged lack of interest in promoting the event, R.K. Anand stepped down as working president of the National Games Organising Committee (NGOC). But the states sports fraternity sees his move as a desperate attempt to distance himself from the jinxed event.         
	Anand, who sent his resignation to Munda, said, I took the decision after Munda ignored my pleas to put a sports minister in charge and put the Games on the fast track.         
	But according to government sources, Anand, who is Jharkhand Olympic Association (JOA) president, couldnt possibly save himself from blame since the JOA was primarily responsible for holding the Games as per a host city agreement signed in 2005.         
	Sources close to the chief minister, however, dismissed Anands move as eyewash since he was working president of NGOC by virtue of being JOA president.         
	If Anand is really serious, he should first quit as president of Jharkhand Olympic Association, an official in the chief ministers secretariat said, adding that the overriding sentiment within the government was that his (Anand) resignation was part of pressure tactics being exerted to scuttle the vigilance probe into gross financial irregularities.         
	Originally scheduled for 2007, the Games has since been postponed as many as five times amid political uncertainty leading to delays in building sports infrastructure and allegations of corruption in awarding various contracts.         
	At a meeting yesterday, Munda had asked the sports department to request vigilance to speed up its probe against various Games officials.         
	But Anand clarified to The Telegraph that his move was not intended to prevent the government from taking action against those who indulged in corruption.                                       
	 quot;Let the government take action against corrupt officials but (it should) also complete preparations for the Games simultaneously, quot; he maintained.         
	Asked why he wasnt resigning from JOA, Anand said, quot;Just wait for some time, quot; indicating that other senior functionaries could also.         
	If that were to happen, the onus of organising the Games would fall on the state government. But given the new governments lack of experience in such matters, it could ultimately lead to the Games being moved out of Jharkhand.         
	And with Kerala having already expressed its desire to take over the Games, the Indian Olympic Association could well favour Gods Own Country to host the much maligned 34th edition.

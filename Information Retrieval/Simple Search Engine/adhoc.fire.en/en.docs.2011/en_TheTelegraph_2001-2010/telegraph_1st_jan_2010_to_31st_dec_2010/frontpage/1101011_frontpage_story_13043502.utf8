  - With govt agencies piling heat, few risked backing Modi        RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                                              
	Jaipur, Oct. 10: The removal of the Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab from the IPL is only the latest chapter in the free fall of Lalit Modi, whose fortunes began dwindling with political change in Rajasthan.        
	Sources suggested that the government probes against Modi may have persuaded the BCCI against giving the Royals any leeway when some of its officials recommended softer action.        
	After the 2008 Rajasthan Assembly polls ousted then BJP chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who had helped Modis rise, the new Congress government got cases filed against him over his land deals and alleged acts of forgery and funds misuse.        
	Chief minister Ashok Gehlot then moved to cut Modis ties with the Rajasthan Cricket Association decisively, fielding Union minister C.P. Joshi in the associations December 2009 presidential elections.        
	When the decisive kick  Modis banishment from the IPL  came this year, one of the members of the disciplinary committee that stripped him of all BCCI posts was Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia.        
	In between, Modi had hit back at the Congress by using Twitter to spark a controversy over Shashi Tharoors links with the IPLs Kochi franchise, but the party controlled the damage by sacrificing the junior foreign minister.         
	Yet, for all his closeness to Raje  which had earned him the nickname super chief minister in Rajasthan Modis connections could not bail him out.        
	It was BJP leader Arun Jaitley who brokered last months peace between BCCI president Shashank Manohar and Jagmohan Dalmiya, paving the way for the Bengal officials rehabilitation and ending Modis hopes of staging a comeback by piggybacking on Dalmiya. Jaitley too was in the disciplinary committee that heard Modis case.        
	Modi now seems to have hardly any political backers left, having even lost the support of Nationalist Congress Party boss Sharad Pawar, former Indian cricket chief and current head of world body ICC.        
	Today, the unspoken factor in the boards action against the two IPL franchises was Modis alleged involvement in them  in the Royals through his brother-in-law Suresh Chellaram and in Kings XI through stepson-in-law Gaurav Burman.        
	Modi reacted furiously on Twitter, saying the BCCI had chosen the path of vengeance and was hell bent on destroying the IPL.        
	The Owners should get together and Run the League on there own. IPL should not be destroyed, he wrote in a series of tweets. Members go to meetings and listen to Diktat of President and President elect. if you open your mouth you are thrown out.        
	Kings surprised         
	Kings XI Punjab, in its formal statement, said it was surprised and saddened by the BCCI action, claiming it had fully cooperated with all government and regulatory authorities as well as the BCCI in assisting them with their questions.        
	The statement called the board decision unfair and said the company has followed all terms and conditions and has not violated any agreement.        
	It said the franchises legal team was studying the BCCI communication. We look forward to presenting the facts and answering any misunderstandings that the BCCI may have.        
	Punjab Cricket Association president I.S. Bindra, who is close to Modi (the associations vice-president), was not available for comment. Other officials, including treasurer M.P. Pandove and secretary G.S. Walia, had switched off their phones.        
	The associations stadium at Mohali, which wears a festive look on Sundays with families flocking to its various facilities, was deserted.                    WITH INPUTS FROM GAJINDER SINGH IN CHANDIGARH

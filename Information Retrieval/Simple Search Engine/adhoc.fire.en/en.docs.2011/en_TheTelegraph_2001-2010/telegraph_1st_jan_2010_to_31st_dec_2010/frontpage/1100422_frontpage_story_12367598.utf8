                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Action nudge in tax raids on KKR and CAB offices at Eden 
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	April 21: The investigation into the IPL reached the hallowed portals of the Eden Gardens that houses an office of the Shah Rukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders, among three franchises raided by taxmen amid indications that the Centre was keen to turn up the heat on the cricket board to act against Lalit Modi.        
	The cross-country raids began in Mumbai with sleuths visiting the offices of World Sports Group (WSG), the marketing arm of the IPL, Multi Screen Media (MSM), formerly Sony Entertainment Television, which has the broadcasting rights, and International Management Group, an organising agency of the IPL.         
	Ad Factors, which handles public relations for the IPL, denied reports of a raid.        
	Modi himself was questioned, for the second time in five days, by investigators at his office in Mumbai.        
	As the IPL chief dug his heels in, daring the cricket board, tax teams surveyed the Chennai offices of India Cements, which owns the Chennai Super Kings. The residence of India Cements managing director, N. Srinivasan, who is also the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), was surveyed as well. Investigators also visited the office of Deccan Chronicle Holdings Ltd, owners of the Deccan Chargers, in Secunderabad.        
	Sources said the raid spree was meant to send a signal to the BCCI to take action against Modi.        
	The Calcutta raids began around 3.30pm when four vehicles, carrying 10 income-tax and five revenue intelligence officials, screeched to a halt in front of the BC Roy Club House at the Eden.         
	The investigators visited the accounts department of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and the Knight Riders office, besides trooping down to the Shakespeare Sarani office of Gameplan, a sports management company that has close ties with the IPL team.        
	We are conducting a consequential raid here. This means todays raid is a fallout of the raids being carried out in Mumbai, said a senior tax department official.         
	The sleuths  carrying briefcases  got off the beacon-fitted cars and entered the premises without giving any chance to the security guards to stop them.         
	They went to the second-floor office of Bishwaroop Dey, CAB joint secretary, and asked him to stay put. Within a few minutes, they disconnected all telephone lines at the CAB office, Dey said.        
	The sleuths divided themselves into two groups. The five revenue intelligence officials entered the KKR office on the first floor and conducted search operations. The others raided the CAB accounts office on the same floor.        
	After entering our office, they revealed their identities and we obviously knew why they were here. They asked us to co-operate with them and started searching for papers and documents, said an employee of the accounts department.        
	The taxmen were surprised to find some of the papers relating to the last matches played at the Eden Gardens and documents relating to KKR dumped in dustbins.        
	We got several official papers from the three dustbins in the KKR office. Some of the papers were half-torn and we had to rearrange them, said an official. We will examine whether these papers are important.         
	A source in the tax department said the focus was on payments made by KKR to both Indian and overseas players. We wanted to check whether tax deductions for the players were done properly or not, he explained.         
	The taxmen, between cups of tea and biscuits, went through every file and document relating to transactions between KKR and the CAB. Over 10 employees at the accounts office, seated on chairs, remained mute spectators.        
	Around 4.30pm, a couple of officials carrying two briefcases left the CAB office. A little later, a CAB office-bearer came out and told reporters that a scheduled news conference called by president Jagmohan Dalmiya in the evening had been cancelled.        
	We are conducting search and seize operations of all files and documents related to KKR and the IPL matches held in Calcutta and also the financial transactions between the CAB and KKR, said an official.        
	The raids continued till late in the night. The taxmen also took a laptop from the CAB computer department. We have learnt that copies of several documents are saved in the laptop, an official said.        
	The officials said they had also found a file detailing KKRs plan to open an office at Rajarhat.         
	We have got a detailed map and other papers. We have also taken a diary of Russell Adams, venue manager of KKR, and letters he had sent to several companies, an official said.        
	Around 6.55pm, four officials went to the office of joint secretary Dey and questioned him behind closed doors for nearly an hour.        
	In Mumbai, a tax team questioned Modi at his office at Four Seasons Hotel regarding the contract with WSG-MSM. Officials said the search at WSG-MSM was in the context of allegations that MSM had paid $80 million as facilitation fee to WSG for the broadcasting rights.        
	 In a statement, WSG said the tax sleuths had demanded contractual agreements in relation to the BCCI, IPL and WSG. Videocon, one of the unsuccessful participants in the latest IPL team auction, is understood to have submitted a copy of its bid document to the income-tax department. Sources said the Gujarat-based Adani Group, which also made an unsuccessful bid, had not yet submitted a copy of its bid.

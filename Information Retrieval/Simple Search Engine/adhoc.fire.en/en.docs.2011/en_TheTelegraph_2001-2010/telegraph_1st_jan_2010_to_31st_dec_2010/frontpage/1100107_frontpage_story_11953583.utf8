				       OUR BUREAU                        People gather outside the Salt Lake hospital after learning that Jyoti Basu is critical. Picture by Amit Datta				                                       
	Jan. 6: Jyoti Basus condition has turned critical since Tuesday night, prompting doctors to put him on ventilator to support his failing lungs and administer life-saving drugs to stabilise his blood pressure and pulse rate.         
	The sudden setback kept Bengal on tenterhooks through Wednesday and the national political establishment glued to the medical updates emanating from Calcutta.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and politburo member Sitaram Yechury are scheduled to reach Calcutta tomorrow to call on the ailing patriarch. Sonia Gandhi is also likely to visit Basu but Congress sources in Delhi did not confirm her schedule.        
	A medical bulletin issued by the Salt Lake private hospital, where Basu was admitted on January 1 with moderately severe pneumonia, this evening said his condition had shown some positive changes.         
	His present condition continues to be still critical but has shown some positive changes since morning. The doctors of the medical board are constantly monitoring him, said T.S. Kuckrejja, executive vice-president, AMRI Hospitals, Salt Lake.         
	An eight-member medical board overseeing Basus treatment will meet at 11am tomorrow to review the situation. Till late into the night, his condition remained critical.         
	His condition is very critical, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said in the afternoon, soon after the Prime Minister spoke to him.        
	According to doctors, Basus condition started deteriorating since midnight and became worse around 2am as he suffered lung function failure, which led to a sudden drop in supply of oxygen to his lungs.        
	The oxygen saturation, which means the level of oxygen in blood, went down significantly. His pulse rate and blood pressure were also low, said an attending doctor.         
	The board of doctors decided to change the antibiotics and the oxygen supply through a BiPap machine was increased. Basu was on non-invasive respiratory support system  BiPap  since January 2.         
	Apart from increasing oxygen supply to his respiratory system, he was given chest physiotherapy but his condition was still worsening, one of the doctors treating him said.        
	Around 6.45am, Basu was put on ventilator support as he needed supply of oxygen into the lungs. Once on ventilator, Basu was administered an inotrope, a life-saving drug, and the doctors said it helped improve his blood pressure in the afternoon. Sources said his maximum blood pressure went up to 130 while the pulse rate improved to 90 per minute.        
	The oxygen saturation and blood pressure have stabilised and his urine output has also increased. However, he will be kept under observation for at least another 48 hours, said a doctor.         
	But the doctors said they were yet to ascertain the exact cause of the sudden deterioration in his condition. We apprehend there is a fresh infection or the existing infection may have worsened. A number of tests have been conducted and we can know the reason only after getting the reports, said a doctor.        
	The moment the first medical bulletin  released at 11.30am  announced that Basu had been put on ventilator support, rumours about his condition swirled thick and fast and thousands of people started crowding around the hospital. Several VIPs, including railway minister Mamata Banerjee, visited the hospital.         
	CPM leaders insisted that Basus condition was improving compared with that in the morning and appealed to people not to spread rumours.         
	The available members of the CPM state secretariat met later this evening to discuss Basus condition and ways to deal with rumour-mongering and the rush of the VIP visitors to the hospital.         
	A section of the CPM feels that the Opposition rush to call on Basu is aimed at portraying the patriarch as a non-party personality. The CPM is keen to project him as a communist first and subtle efforts at crowd management are likely to be put in place outside the hospital tomorrow.        
	Prime Minister Singh is setting aside a scheduled cabinet meeting and other engagements to visit Basu. Sources in the Prime Ministers Office said Singh had sought information on Basus health through the day and decided late in the evening to go to Calcutta.        
	The Prime Minister was scheduled to attend a meeting of the Bharatiya Pravasi Council tomorrow. Most official engagements of the Prime Minister in Delhi tomorrow stand shelved for the moment, a source said.  
	Your questions  
	What caused the alarm   on Wednesday?  
	 The exact cause of   the alarm is yet to be   ascertained by doctors.   They fear that a fresh lung   infection developed or the existing infection   deteriorated. It will be   confirmed only after final   culture and sensitivity   reports of the lavage,   collected through   bronchoscopy, are availabl  
	 When did Basu rsquo;s condition start to worsen?   
	Around Tuesday midnight. It became critical around 2am						   
	What were the worrying signals?						   
	Severe respiratory distress, fall in blood oxygen level, pulse rate and blood   pressure (BP). Oxygen   saturation, which means   the level of oxygen in blood, went down. For a person of Basu rsquo;s age, the oxygen   saturation should be at   least 90 per cent (95 to   100 in younger people).   His oxygen saturation fell   to as low as 80.						   
	Basu rsquo;s maximum BP was   80 (the normal is 140 for his age) and pulse rate was 50 per minute (normal 60 to 80 per minute).Urine output also decreased alarmingly  
							 How did the doctors   respond?						   
	First, doctors increased   non-invasive oxygen supply with the help of a mask (BiPap) and gave chest physiotherapy to increase blood pressure. They also changed the antibiotics. These didn rsquo;t work. So, around 6.45am, he was   put on ventilator and given an inotrope, a drug to revive blood pressure and pulse rate. It is a life-saving drug						   
	What does ventilator   support mean?						   
	It is an invasive life support system that facilitates artificial oxygen supply to lungs in line with the requirement of the body through tubes inserted into the respiratory system						   
	Did Basu rsquo;s organs fail?   
	Doctors said he had suffered lung function failure. But all other organs, including his  heart, liver and kidneys, are functioning						   
	Does Basu still have   pneumonia?						   
	He still has moderately  severe pneumonia						   
	What was his condition on Wednesday evening?  
	 His blood pressure, pulse  rate and oxygen saturation were within acceptable limits.   He was on ventilator and his condition remained critical						   
	Why are doctors   saying there is a slight   improvement?						   
	His requirement of artificial oxygen from ventilator   support decreased, which prompted doctors to form the opinion that his lung function was improving. The   stabilisation of BP and pulse rate also gave them hope  
	 What are the factors that are still causing concern?						   
	His age (95). His blood  pressure and pulse rate   can fluctuate without notice.   Also the fact that he is on   ventilator, which might   eventually affect the   functioning of other vital   organs, including the   kidneys, heart and liver

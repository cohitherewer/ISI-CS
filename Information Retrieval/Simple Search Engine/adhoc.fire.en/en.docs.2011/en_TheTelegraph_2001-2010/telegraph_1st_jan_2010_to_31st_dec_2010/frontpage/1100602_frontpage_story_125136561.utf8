	Kolkata, June 2 (PTI): West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today refused to take questions on the civic poll results that delivered a blow to the ruling Left Front.  
	 Asked if the results of the civic poll, widely seen as a trend-setter for next year's Assembly election, were on expected lines, Bhattacharjee evaded any reply and left the state secretariat in a huff.					   
	CPI-M headquarters on Alimuddin street wore a deserted look after the results that gave Trinamool Congress a thumping majority in the KMC.In contrast, there was an air of jubilation in front of Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee's Kalighat residence with party workers celebrating the massive victory. Overjoyed Trinamool workers took out small victory processions in some parts of the metropolis.  
	For the ruling Left Front, which was in power in 55 out of the 81 municipalities, it was an opportunity to recover lost ground after the string of electoral defeats it suffered since the 2008 panchayat polls and last year's Lok Sabha election.
    The major losers in Kolkata included the deputy mayor of the KMC Left Front's Kalyan Mukherjee, mayor-in-council members Abu Sufian and Faiz Ahmed Khan.
    Incidentally, Trinamool Congress won two-thirds majority in the 141-member KMC, capturing 94 of the 135 wards which were declared by press time.

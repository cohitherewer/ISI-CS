	Jamshedpur/Ranchi, April 3: A member of the Dalma squad was killed in an encounter in Patamda today as paramilitary forces fought a pitched battle with rebels along the Goelkera-Sonua border in West Singhbhum and police sources confirmed that operations against Maoist rebels had begun in Sonua, Manoharpur and Chaibasa.        
	Over half-a-dozen companies of CRPF and two companies of police were taking part in the operation, said a police officer, adding that a bunker and a training camp had been destroyed.        
	Amar Singh, alias Sunil Gorai, was killed in a police encounter at Srirampur village in Patamda police station area, about 45km from Jamshedpur, around 2am today.         
	The killing comes five days after another member of the squad, Prabodh Singh, alias Gangadhar Singh, fell to police bullets at Bagudih village in Patamda.        
	Thirty-year-old Amar, a close associate of Dalma squad commander Arup Mochi, was hiding in his relative Sudhir Gorais house when he was killed. The police recovered his bullet-riddled body a little away from the house. The police and CRPF jawans reached Srirampur following a tip-off that Amar and some rebels were hiding there and surrounded Gorais house.        
	The rebels started firing from inside the house and we retaliated, said Sanjay Kumar Singh, officer in-charge of Patamda police station. He added that two Naxalites managed to flee under the cover of darkness. We could not chase them as the firing was on. We recovered Amars body at 4am, Singh said, adding there was no trace of the other rebel. However, it was yet to be ascertained how many rebels were hiding in Gorais house.

	Amar, a resident of Kamalpur village in Patamda, had been engaged in rebel activities for quite some time.         
	Meanwhile, in neighbouring West Singhbhum, security forces engaged in a fierce gun battle with the Maoists for over four hours this morning.         
	The forces, including jawans of the CRPF, district police, Cobra and special task force (STF) personnel, came across the Maoists while conducting long range patrolling near the dense forests of Goelkera.        
	The exchange of fire started near the rebel stronghold of Goelkera and Sonua border at 11am, said Akhilesh Jha, police superintendent of West Singhbhum. According to Jha, the exchange of fire took place in a forest located between Bandu and Sinku villages on the Goelkera-Sonua border.        
	Over 300 rounds were fired from both sides. No casualties have been reported yet. The Maoists fled after heavy firing from the security forces side. The forces are still combing the area, Jha said.        
	While fleeing, the Naxalites left behind some essentials and Maoist literature, the SP added.        
	Speaking in Ranchi, DGP Neyaz Ahmed said: The information on todays progress is being compiled. Our boys are doing their job. Our operations will be going their usual way.        
	He added that the police were intensifying efforts to stop the flow of cash to the rebels.

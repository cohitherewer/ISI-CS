The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | State loses 2 Koderma units
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                State loses 2 Koderma units
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                            Power punch                                  
	Ranchi, Feb. 1: Jharkhands loss is Bengals gain.        
	Power major DVC has decided to shift two units of Koderma thermal power plants second phase to Raghunathpur in Bengal, despite the state governments best efforts to retain them at a meeting chaired by deputy chief minister and energy minister Raghubar Das with DVC chairman Subrata Biswas last Saturday.        
	At the meeting, the DVC chief argued that Koderma did not have adequate water to cater to the needs of the proposed power plant. He added that senior officials involved in the project had also indicated that setting up a new reservoir in Koderma was not feasible due to various reasons.        
	In the second phase, two units with an installed capacity of 660MW each were due to come up in Koderma. These units would have been commissioned in the Twelfth Five Year Plan period.        
	Rules say at least 10 per cent of the power produced by DVC units ought to be supplied to local consumers at normal tariffs. Therefore, the decision to transfer the proposed units to Raghunathpur would amount to Jharkhand losing 132MW of power and several hundred employment opportunities, a senior DVC official in Calcutta said.        
	Biswas, however, remained adamant. I have clarified everything before the Jharkhand government. We cannot set up new units in Koderma unless we get water. I dont want to comment beyond this, he said, when contacted by The Telegraph.        
	The DVCs move has also raised certain questions. A senior state official wondered how the DVC did not factor in water scarcity in Koderma while preparing the detailed project report (DPR), which was approved by the Union power ministry. He also questioned the logic behind choosing Raghunathpur as the alternate site.        
	Sources, meanwhile, said the proposal to shift the units to Raghunathpur was yet to be approved by DVCs board of directors and the DPR for that was also pending. However, the groundwork was on in full swing. While the Koderma plant was being set up in association with BHEL, Reliance Power Limited is involved in Raghunathpur.        
	At a parliamentary committee meeting held in Delhi on January 21, JD (U) MP from Bihar Sushil Kumar Singh strongly objected to the shifting of the Koderma units to Raghunathpur. He asked how Raghunathpur had been sanctioned the project without a DPR.                          
	Officials alleged that the DVCs indifferent attitude towards Jharkhand was also evident from the fact that units 7 and 8 of Chandrapura thermal power plant were due to begin production in January and March, 2007, respectively. However, they were yet to become functional only because the units has not been granted mandatory explosives licence by the Controller of Explosives in Nagpur. The inordinate delay had led to huge escalation in project costs.        
	Further, in Bengal, the DVC agreed to give compensatory jobs in lieu of half an acre of land, but in Jharkhand, the criteria for jobs was two acres of lands. The amount spent by DVC on setting up ITIs and community development programmes in the two states too differed.        
	Jharkhand has also long sought the shifting of DVC and CIL headquarters to Ranchi. In 2007, Union power minister Sushilkumar Shinde laid the foundation of the DVC building in Ranchi, but there has been little progress since.        
	We have asked the DVC chairman to submit detailed reports extensively covering all such issues. We will also be taking up the issue with the Centre. Injustice to Jharkhand will not be tolerated, Das said.

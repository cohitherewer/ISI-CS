The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Deport plan for Bangla migrants
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Deport plan for Bangla migrants
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                      Mayavati                          
	Lucknow, June 12: The Mayavati government today said it had identified 8,500 Bangladeshis living illegally in the state and planned to deport them, wading into a sensitive political issue in an attempt to hijack a BJP plank.        
	State home department officials said that once the police had verified all the alleged Bangladeshis antecedents, deportation would be recommended. They added that most of these Bengali-speaking settlers were Muslims and lived in Meerut, Lucknow and Noida.        
	State home secretary Deepak Kumar said 57 Bangladeshis had been arrested and 18 deported in the first five months of this year.        
	Such deportation, however, hardly achieves anything because Dhaka refuses to accept the alleged immigrants as its citizens. After the BSF pushes them into Bangladesh, that countrys border troops again push them back into India, an official said.        
	Also, the issue can be thorny, with the Bengal Left often alleging that Muslims from Bengal are branded Bangladeshis and victimised by the police of other states.        
	The BJP had attempted to orchestrate a campaign in 1999-2004 for the deportation of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. Political analysts said Mayavati was trying to hijack the issue to win over some of the BJPs upper caste Hindu voters.        
	An official claimed the Mayavati government had started the drive because of the terror attacks in the state by home-grown terror modules.        
	Samajwadi Party leaders were quick to claim that the Mayavati government was targeting their supporters by branding them Bangladeshis. However, like the Left in Bengal, the Samajwadis here have often been accused of issuing ration cards to Bangladeshis to naturalise them and create a vote bank.        
	The state government is aware of the sensitivity of the issue. We will verify all the details of their identity before deporting them, said R.K. Srivastava, an official of the immigration unit of state intelligence.        
	Home secretary Deepak Kumar said most of these settlers  about 6,000  lived in Meerut in western Uttar Pradesh, 350km from here, and about 1,800 in Lucknow.        
	In Meerut, they try to merge themselves in the mainstream Muslim society but their broken Hindustani gives them away. They settle in Meerut because it is easier for them to travel to Delhi in search of work, an official said.        
	In Lucknow, they work as labourers in the unorganised sector and their women work as housemaids.        
	Another home department official said that some 350 Bangladeshi nationals had been identified in Noida but their number there could be higher.        
	Many of these Bangladeshis are engaged in human trafficking, an official alleged. He said the police had arrested four Bangladeshis, including a woman, in January from Saharanpur district and they had admitted to running a trafficking racket for the past five years.        
	They were bringing Bangladeshis to India by promising them jobs and were charging money from them, the official said.

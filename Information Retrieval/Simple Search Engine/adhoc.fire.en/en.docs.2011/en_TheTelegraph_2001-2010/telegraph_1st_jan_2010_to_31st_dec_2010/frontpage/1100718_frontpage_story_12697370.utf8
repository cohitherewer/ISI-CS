	Darjeeling, July 17: The Centre has convened tripartite talks with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and the Bengal government on July 24, a day before the hill party was to start a series of general strikes including a 40-day shutdown.        
	Sources in the Morcha, buoyed by the announcement after being on the back foot since the May 21 murder of Madan Tamang, hinted that the strikes would be called off.        
	The fate of the tripartite meeting  the second round of political talks and the sixth overall  had been hanging in the balance since the murder of Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League leader Tamang, allegedly by Morcha supporters.        
	The embattled Morcha had threatened a hills shutdown if the talks dates were not finalised before July 24.        
	Morcha president Bimal Gurung yesterday received a fax from N.S. Kalsi, joint secretary in the Union home ministry, saying the talks on the Gorkhaland issue would be held in New Delhi on July 24 under the chairmanship of junior home minister Ajay Maken.        
	The last round of political-level talks had been held in New Delhi on March 18 and was attended by Union minister of state for health Dinesh Trivedi and Bengal ministers Asok Bhattacharya and Surjya Kanta Mishra.        
	Although the next round of political-level talks was to be held in mid-May, it landed in jeopardy following Tamangs murder. The Centres decision to hold the talks has therefore come as a boost for the Morcha.        
	Any breakthrough on the Gorkhaland issue is, however, unlikely with Gurung having already announced that his party would no longer be discussing an interim set-up for the hills.        
	The chapter on the interim set-up is closed. We will only talk about a separate state, Gurung had told a rally in Darjeeling on May 30.        
	The previous round of political-level talks had been centred on the interim set-up, a proposal about which had earlier been submitted by the Morcha to the Centre. The Centre and the Bengal government have made it clear they are only prepared to discuss the interim set-up at this juncture.        
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said: In the run-up to the meeting, we will organise a series of rallies and public meetings from July 21 to 24 across the area that we want within Gorkhaland. Party chief Bimal Gurung will also address a public meeting in Kurseong on July 20 followed by another meeting in Darjeeling on July 22.        
	Asked if the party would go ahead with the general strikes, Giri said: Our party president will be making an announcement.        
	But Morcha sources indicated the strikes would be withdrawn to create a congenial atmosphere for the talks.        
	In Calcutta, state home secretary Samar Ghosh confirmed the meeting. The next round of political-level talks will be held on July 24, he said.        
	The Opposition parties in the hills, which had been demanding that other parties too be invited to the talks, hit out at the Bengal government.        
	The state government was maintaining it would not sit for talks with people accused in Tamangs murder, said Shekar Chhetri, leader of the Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists (CPRM), the hills second-largest party.        
	We do not think that this CPM government will give us justice. Now we will approach the Trinamul Congress, CPRM spokesperson Taramoni Rai said.        
	From the manner in which the state government is dealing with the Morcha, we are sure that there is an understanding between them.        
	The home ministry fax said the talks would be held at 3pm at the Conference Hall (Room No. 119, North Block, New Delhi) of the ministry of home affairs.

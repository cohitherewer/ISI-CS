The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Jethmalani gets BJP Rajasthan nomination
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Jethmalani gets BJP Rajasthan nomination
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                             Ram Jethmalani at a news conference in Jaipur on Sunday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, June 6: The BJP has nominated lawyer Ram Jethmalani to the Rajya Sabha from Rajasthan under pressure from Narendra Modi and L.K. Advani.         
	Jethmalani, 87, is fighting for the Gujarat chief minister in the 2002 riots case.         
	The BJP initially wanted to nominate him as an Independent despite resistance from a section of the Rajasthan BJP. But Jethmalani insisted he would fight on the partys symbol.         
	His case was also pushed by a Mumbai-based corporate group that is close to major political parties.         
	Jethmalanis election is almost certain because the BJP has 39 surplus second preference votes in Rajasthan after the victory of the partys other nominee, V.P. Singh.         
	It needs just two more votes that sources said will be managed from the Independents and the Janata Dal (United).        
	The Congress  that has 16 extra votes after the election of two of its candidates  is reportedly putting a spanner in the BJPs works by fielding a third nominee who, too, it hopes to get elected with the help of the Independents.         
	Some in the BJP were unwilling to go for Jethmalani because he was perceived as undependable. In 2004, he had contested against Atal Bihari Vajpayee from Lucknow with the Congresss backing. He had also spoken out against the death penalty for Afzal Guru in the Parliament attack case.         
	That position was unacceptable to the BJP, which has in mind that the lawyer was thrown out of the party for defending conspirators of the Indira Gandhi assassination.         
	What tipped the scales in Jethmalanis favour was his decision to take up Modis case in the Supreme Court against the special investigation teams probe into the 2002 killings.         
	In March this year, he appeared for Gujarat BJP MLA, Kalubhai Maliwal, an accused with 63 others, including Modi in the murder of Congress leader Ahsan Jafri in the Gulbarg Society episode.         
	Jethmalani contested the apex courts order, entrusting the investigation to the SIT. The bench has said it would have to consider if the order in its entirety could be recalled.

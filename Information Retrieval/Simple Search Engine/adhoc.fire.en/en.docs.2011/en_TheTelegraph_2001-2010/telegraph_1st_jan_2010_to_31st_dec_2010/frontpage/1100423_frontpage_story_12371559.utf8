	Islamabad/Karachi, April 22: Sania Mirza arrived in Pakistan today to chaotic scenes that reminded her of home  or rather, Bollywood.        
	The tennis player and husband Shoaib Malik walked into Karachi airports international arrival lounge hand in hand as, in the words of a Sindh minister, state-level guests of the government.        
	But with security thin on the ground, they were immediately mobbed by passengers and airport staff.        
	The couple, looking shaken by the chaos, were later escorted to the domestic departure lounge under heavy security to catch their connecting flight to Islamabad.        
	Like in Bollywood movies, the security here also has come late, Sania, who wore dark glasses, quipped.        
	The couple will attend a reception thrown by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani in Islamabad and visit the Indian high commission to sort out Sanias visa problems. Mission officials said the high commissioner was expected to meet the couple tomorrow.        
	On April 25, Shoaibs family will host a wedding reception in hometown Sialkot and two days later, another one in Lahore.        
	Lahore police chief Pervaiz Rathore said more than 2,000 policemen would guard the reception venue in the city. The Malik family has not revealed the venue. Sources said the couple would check in at the Pearl Continental hotel in Lahore.        
	Sindh sports minister Muhammad Ali Shah, who received Sania and Shoaib in Karachi, gifted them a traditional Sindhi shawl, a cap and a bouquet. It is great to have Sania in Pakistan finally. They will be state-level guests of the government, Shah said.        
	An airport security officer said: We had to call in security to control things because there was too much rush, and Shoaib and Sania were a bit bewildered by the rush they saw on their arrival.         
	Dozens of fans had gathered outside the airport but could only catch a glimpse of the duo. Some of the fans carried placards saying: We welcome Pakistans daughter-in-law.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                KKR call lifts sidelined Assam tweakers spirits 
  - Reported for chucking in Ranji match, Arlen Konwar gets chance to redeem career with IPL assignment          IMTIAZ AHMED                            Konwar: Bright prospects                                        
	Guwahati, July 21: Sidelined Assam off-spinner Arlen Konwar is back into the reckoning, and with a bang.         
	His career got a jolt after he was reported unofficially for chucking in the last Ranji Trophy season, where he scalped 32 wickets in six matches, Konwar, 30, has not only overcome the hitch but also made the cut to the high profile Indian Premier League outfit  Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	Konwar was asked by umpire K. Hariharan to bowl in a half-sleeve shirt during the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal match against Uttar Pradesh here in December last year, after the opponents felt there was a certain degree of deviation beyond limit in his bowling.        
	Confirming the development, Konwar said he has received the papers from the Calcutta-based outfit and has been asked to join the Knight Riders team in Colombo on July 25. The team is on an exposure tour to Sri Lanka.        
	I got the contract (offer) on July 14 and was asked to send my passport to apply for my visa, which I did immediately. My visa is almost ready and I am flying to Chennai on July 24 from where I will leave for Colombo the next day, Konwar told The Telegraph here today.        
	Konwar has become the second player from Assam to be in the IPL fold after pacer Abu Nechim Ahmed turned out for the Mumbai Indians in the last IPL. All-rounder Dhiraj Goswami is also with the Knight Riders Academy, which is the reserve bench of the main team.        
	Konwar was instrumental in getting Assam promoted to the Elite division (of Ranji Trophy). Dav Whatmore, Wasim Akram and Sourav Ganguly  all had a look at him during the camp at CCFC and were quite impressed, KKR cricket manager Joydeep Mukherjee told The Telegraph in Calcutta today.        
	The status of his bowling action is still not known, but as far as KKR is concerned, were happy with his showing. Its too early to say whether he will be there in the playing side, but he has as good a chance as anyone else, Mukherjee added.         
	For Konwar, who has had a raw deal so far in terms of employment  he is only a Grade IV employee with the Railways, which has now refused to release him for a Grade III job with the postal department  the offer from KKR is a dream come true.        
	I was expecting the call in the last edition of the IPL in South Africa when the Knight Riders had to do without a full-time off-spinner and I was among the 32 probables till the last moment. However, things did not work out as expected then. But, its better late than never. Ive got new motivation now and Ill deliver my best, Konwar said. The KKR names a 32-member squad of probables for the IPL and selects the final XI for every match from amongst them.        
	On the other hand, Konwar has also impressed the Assam Cricket Association (ACA) experts by proving that there was no flaw in his bowling action in a recent rectification camp for spinners. We have tested him (Konwar) and video-analysed his action at the camp and found his deviation below 10 degrees. So, we hope he will be eligible for the Ranji Trophy tournament next season, ACA joint secretary and cricket committee convenor Umananda Bora told The Telegraph. Deviation beyond 15 degrees is not permitted according to the rules.        
	Bora also said the cricket committee was on the lookout for an outstation off-spinner to replace Konwar in the next season. But his latest show was quite impressive and I think we can now go for a batsman instead of an off-spinner, as Konwar can definitely be a part of the state squad.

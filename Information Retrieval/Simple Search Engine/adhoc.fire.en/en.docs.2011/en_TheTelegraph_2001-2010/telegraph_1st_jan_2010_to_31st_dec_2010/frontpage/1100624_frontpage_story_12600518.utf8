                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Formula for happiness: mentoring
  - Indian scientists more satisfied than Chinese and Japanese          G.S. MUDUR                                                    
	New Delhi, June 23: Chinas research output is far greater than Indias but a 16-country survey of satisfaction among scientists shows that Indian scientists are relatively more satisfied than their Chinese or even Japanese counterparts.        
	The survey by British journal Nature suggests that India and China  both dubbed emerging scientific powers  have low satisfaction ranking scores compared with scores in western Europe or North America.        
	Japanese scientists appear to be the least satisfied in the survey based on responses from more than 10,500 academic and industry scientists.        
	But the survey has also thrown up indications of improving job satisfaction among scientists in China and India over the past year, compared with scientists in most other countries covered in the survey.        
	The results suggest that the guidance scientists received from superiors and colleagues was the most significant factor influencing their satisfaction levels rather than salary, which was the second-biggest driver of satisfaction.        
	Mentoring is a very important process in science  its either formal or informal, said a senior official in Indias Department of Science and Technology who was not associated with the study. Senior policymakers say scientific research demands rigour and discipline that could be identified through research guides who serve as mentors.                            
	But in the current environment where the pursuit of a postgraduate degree or even a doctorate degree resembles a contractual process, the process of mentoring may be breaking down, the official said.        
	Amid the high cost of education leading up to careers in academics, the official said, the students almost demand their degrees  and mentoring tends to take a back seat.        
	The third most significant factor affecting satisfaction was independence.        
	China, India and Japan were the only countries where the percentage of the respondents who said they were satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their degree of independence was less than 60 per cent.        
	In a university system with limited resources and infrastructure for research, freedom would have little meaning, particularly in experimental sciences, said a senior scientist in a government-funded laboratory.        
	Indian scientists believe that the increased research funding in recent years might be contributing to growing levels of satisfaction in select institutions and prompting the return of scientists from Europe and America.        
	Its a morale-booster to work in a community of young people whove come back to India and are clustered in an institution with good funding and infrastructure, said Sumantra Chattarji, a neurobiologist at the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, who set up his own laboratory at the NCBS after post-doctoral positions at Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.        
	The survey revealed gender differences  women scientists are paid less than men scientists  in all the countries with significant respondents  Australia, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, India, Japan, Canada and the US.        
	The salaries of male scientists were 18 to 40 per cent higher than salaries of women scientists. The causes of this gender inequality may range from sexism to the clash between childbearing and rearing and the demands of the career-critical years, Kathleen Christensen, director, workplace, at the Alfred Sloan Foundation wrote in a commentary in the same issue of Nature.

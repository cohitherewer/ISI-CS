  - Find out who make the grade for Mamata          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata Banerjee at the site of a building collapse in New Delhi, where at least 30 people from Bengal have died. Picture by Prem Singh                                        
	Calcutta, Nov. 17: Yuvraj Singh is luckier than Gautam Deb.         
	The luckless player has only been demoted to B category in the cricket contracts, whereas Mamata has banished the Bengal housing minister to Z grade, that too without naming him.        
	The railway minister today refused to respond to Debs suggestion yesterday to accept in Singur her own formula of returning 10 per cent developed land.        
	 Dont ask me to react to everybodys comments. There should be a demarcation between A B C and D categories. If the chief minister or party (CPM) secretary says something, I can react. But I wont reply to remarks made by Z-grade people. Please ask my partys block presidents for that, Mamata said at her Kalighat residence before leaving for Delhi today. How can I respond to land robbers? This government is a blacklisted one. The state has been rocked by land scandals, she added.        
	In response to Mamatas demand at a Trinamul Congress rally in Rajarhat that 10 per cent of the developed plots be given back to land losers, Deb had proposed that the railway minister accept the same formula in Singur and not ask for the return of a higher quantum there.         
	Wondering why the 10 per cent rule should be applied selectively, Deb had said yesterday: Why only Rajarhat? Why not Singur, why not Nandigram and why not for all the railway projects?                          
	In Singur, Trinamul has demanded the return of 400 of nearly 1,000 acres set aside for the Tatas as well as the ancillaries. Ten per cent will translate to around 100 acres  the same quantity the government had proposed to hand back at the peak of the Singur agitation.        
	Asked about the classification made by Mamata, Deb said: I know she is a leader of high stature and certainly higher than me. But she had spent an hour talking about a Z-grade leader at the Trinamul rally in Rajarhat last week. So, why is she talking about grades now? Actually, I had made a specific proposal and she had nothing to say about that. She has become hot-headed.        
	State industries minister Nirupam Sen justified Debs contention that the 10 per cent formula be applied to Singur and that Mamata should accept the challenge thrown by Gautambabu.        
	After a CPM state secretariat meeting, the industries minister said: Gautambabu didnt say anything wrong about the 10 per cent formula. If she agrees to it in Singur as proposed by her in Rajarhat, it would mean around 100 acres will have to be returned in Singur. So, she should accept the challenge thrown by Gautambabu. At least, that would enable the setting up of industry in Singur.        
	 During the Singur talks, we had said that the WBIDC (West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation) had 71 acres and that we can organise another 29 acres. That would have made up the return of 100 acres. In fact, the chief minister had himself offered to return 100 acres then. But they didnt agree, Sen added.        
	Leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee today met governor M.K. Narayanan and demanded that the state government be persuaded to publish a white paper on Rajarhat detailing acquisition, compensation and allotments through quotas.        
	Besides submitting papers on the states financial crisis, I told the governor that the state government should immediately be asked to come up with a white paper on Rajarhat, Chatterjee later said.

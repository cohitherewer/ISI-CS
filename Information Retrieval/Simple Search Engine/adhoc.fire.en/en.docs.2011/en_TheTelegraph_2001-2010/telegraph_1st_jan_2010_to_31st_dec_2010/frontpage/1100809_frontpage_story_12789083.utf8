          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             A jawan trains for counter-insurgency operations near Agartala on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Union government is working on a plan to bolster infrastructure in at least 35 districts affected by Left-wing extremism, among them Bengals West Midnapore, to douse the influence of Maoists.         
	The districts, spread across nine states, will receive up to Rs 50 crore each every year to add infrastructure aimed at improving the quality of life of local communities, under the plan discussed yesterday at a government meeting that was attended by Union home minister P. Chidambaram.         
	A team of several district-level officials in charge of public infrastructure, education, health and forest management would be tasked with designing the programmes to spend the funds in a manner tailored to specific needs of the local communities.         
	In Chidambarams words, the programme could bring about a remarkable change in the quality of life for the local communities.         
	The funds, Chidambaram said, could be used to deliver primary education, health services, water, sanitation, and connectivity.         
	Several districts in Bihar  Arwal, Aurangabad, Gaya, Jamui, Jehanabad, and Rohtas  are among the 35 labelled as critically affected by Left-wing extremism. Other affected districts are also expected to receive funds under the plan.         
	Environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh said his ministry would ensure that the forest conservation act did not pose any constraint on expanding public infrastructure in the Maoist-infested districts.        
	The meeting of the national conference on forestry administration in Maoist-dominated areas was organised by Rameshs ministry.         
	The environment ministry also plans to introduce a community foresters programme under which residents of an area in a rebel-infested forest zone would be recruited for short-term employment in forest management activities, a senior official said.         
	Several district forest officials complained that the government freeze on recruitment and abolition of frontline junior forest administration staff was contributing to unemployment among the youth in the rebel-affected areas.         
	Even if they are school dropouts, they could help with many kinds of activities that forest work demands, a senior official said.         
	But a rural development specialist told the conference that some special gesture may be needed to build the trust of local communities before new development programmes are provided in Maoist-affected regions.         
	There is a serious trust deficit, said Ajay Dandekar, associate professor at the Institute of Rural Management, Ahmedabad, whose group has toured areas across several rebel-infested zones in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Orissa. We believe that insensitivity towards tribals at the level of district administration coupled with the development gap has created space for Naxalism, Dandekar said.         
	Whether its because of indifference or callousness or other government priorities, tribals have not gained at all  despite our boast of about 8 per cent growth, said N.C. Saxena, a former administrator and chairperson of a joint committee of the ministries of environment and tribal affairs. In some districts in central India, Saxena told the meeting, the literacy rate among Scheduled Tribe women was less than five per cent. Theres no explanation or attempt to analyse why this is the situation, Saxena said. The new-found focus on tribal issues appears driven by the interest in mining and the violence from the Maoists.

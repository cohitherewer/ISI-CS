          OUR BUREAU                                           Followers march towards the venue. A Telegraph picture.       Kolkata July 21: Trinamool Congress headed by Railway Minister and party supremo Mamata Banerjee commemorates the Martyr's day with a big procession in Esplanade, before the CESC house at Kolkata. Blocking traffic from many parts and almost paralysing the city, Didi rsquo;s gathering was a big hit.   This is the first big gathering ever since the party won over the red brigade in the recently held Kolkata Municipal Elections. The alliance between Congress and Trinamool Congress continued as leaders from both the parties participated in this gathering, to observe the day.  Speaking on the disastrous train accident that took place at Sainthia last Monday, Mamata Banerjee expressed her deep seated condolence. But pointing to her oppositions who demanded her resignation, she questions, ldquo;in the last 38 years more than 60,000 people were killed, who will resign for it? rdquo; A strong and confident Mamata asks the people of Bengal to rise against the Left front brigade and bring in a political change in Bengal.   More than a lakh people from various parts of West Bengal travelled down to listen Didi speak. Quoting Rabindranath Tagore and Kavi Nazrool Islam in her orations, Banerjee took the style of Brutus in Julius Caesar by addressing the gathering as ldquo;Friends rdquo;.   Traffic was choked in parts of Lenin Sarani, C.R. Avenue, Moulali, BBD Bag, S.N Banerjee Road, and many other places. LCD screens were fitted in many parts along the Central Avenue, to give a complete glance to people around.

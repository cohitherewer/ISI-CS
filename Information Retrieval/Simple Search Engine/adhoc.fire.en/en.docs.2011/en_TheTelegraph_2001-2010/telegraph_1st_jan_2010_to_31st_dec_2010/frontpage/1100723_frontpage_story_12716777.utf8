  - Rebuff to Pillai reflects bid   to shore up peace process        SANJAY K. JHA                                           
	New Delhi, July 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is worried about the hostile climate that emerged after foreign minister S.M. Krishnas visit to Pakistan and favours immediate de-escalation of tension, highly placed sources told The Telegraph today.        
	Krishnas public rebuff to home secretary G.K. Pillai yesterday was part of that project, the sources in the Congress added.        
	The sources said the Prime Minister would not like the dialogue process to break down and Krishnas disapproval of the timing of Pillais comment was a damage-control gesture. The sources confirmed that Krishna did discuss the matter with the Prime Minister before going public with his response.        
	On the eve of Krishnas talks with his Pakistan counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Pillai had spoken about the involvement of the ISI in the Mumbai attacks.        
	The home ministry has sought to clarify that the timing of Pillais comment was accidental as he thought it would be reported after a few days on the next Sunday. But the external affairs ministry and the PMO both felt that the indiscretion by such a senior bureaucrat was unthinkable.         
	A disparaging remark Pillai made about Kashmir politician Mufti Mohammed Sayeed had also angered the Congress leadership as serving bureaucrats are not expected to make political comments, one leader said.        
	The appointment of a spokesperson in the home ministry came as a response to these indiscretions. Pillai, who is otherwise considered a bright and efficient official, will not face more action and is expected to continue in the home ministry.        
	The government also does not want to give the Opposition an issue on the eve of a Parliament session by taking strong action, particularly when a section of the political class has hailed Pillais conduct after Qureshi played to his domestic gallery by adopting a belligerent stand.        
	The dominant view within the ruling combine is that India does not have to stoop to Qureshis level to make a point. The sources said Krishnas dignified conduct had been appreciated by the Prime Minister, who is convinced that the collapse of the dialogue process would be detrimental to Indias interests.        
	The government believes that complete disengagement with Islamabad has not helped India in the past. Besides, the international community will not appreciate an eyeball-to-eyeball situation between India and Pakistan.        
	The PMO also feels that escalation of tension between the two countries will give hawks in the Pakistani establishment an upper hand, which will not help India in any way.        
	The sources said the PMO felt that if India could engage with Pakistan after Kargil and the 26/11 Mumbai attack, it would be unwise to take a tough stand on Qureshis comments which were made with an eye on the audience he was addressing.        
	The Indian government has no doubt that state actors did have a role to play in the Mumbai attacks but believes public posturing on this would not help build the right atmospherics for the dialogue.         
	Sources in the government agreed that the US would not appreciate India making a public show of 26/11 suspect David Headleys interrogation and Pillais remarks were in violation of the promise made to the Obama administration.         
	It could become an international embarrassment if the impression gained ground that India does not keep its word, said a source, conceding that Pillai would not have done this without home minister P. Chidambarams clearance.        
	But the sources sought to play down the possibility of a turf war between the home ministry and the foreign ministry.

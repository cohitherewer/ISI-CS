The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Power pangs get worse

	Ranchi, April 5: With total generation falling far short of total requirements, large parts of the state were today forced to go without power for long stretches even as the mercury crossed the 39 degree Celsius mark.        
	Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Ltd (TVNL), the states premier thermal power unit, generated over 180MW, while Patratu Thermal Power Station (PTPS) general manager P.N. Singh told The Telegraph that they were somehow getting the more than three-decades-old plant to generate 160MW.         
	Singh pointed out that of the 10 units that make up PTPS, only three units were operating. Two units are currently being renovated by Bharat Heavy Electricals. Two other units were badly damaged by a fire in 2002 while the remaining three units, which are more than 30 years old, require urgent modernisation.         
	With a peak time demand of over 900MW and total generation hovering around 340MW, the state faced a net shortfall 560MW.        
	A portion of the deficit was managed by drawing around 300MW from the central pool. However with an uncovered deficit of over 260MW, Jharkhand State Electricity Board was left with no option but to enforce blackouts throughout the state in phases.        
	However with summer temperatures soaring and generation falling far short of demand, residents would have to bear with long power cuts in the months to come.        
	A second unit at TVNL, which has been under repairs since November last year, is not expected to be operational by the end of the month. TVNL general manager S.P. Choudhury said: Though work is on at a war footing, the extent of repairs are quite huge and will need a lot of time.                          
	Choudhury said the other unit, which is operational, too needs to be shut down for normal maintenance. However, we are waiting for the second unit to be back in operation after which we would be shutting down unit one for maintenance, he said.        
	Even the state capital was not spared as every residential area faced load-shedding since early this morning. JSEB officials said with various repair jobs underway in parts of Ranchi, supply had to be cut off for long stretches.

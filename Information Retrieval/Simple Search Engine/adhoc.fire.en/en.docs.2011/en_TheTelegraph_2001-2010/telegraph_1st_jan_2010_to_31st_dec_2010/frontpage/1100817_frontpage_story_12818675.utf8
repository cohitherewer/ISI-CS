          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Aug. 16: A central committee member of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and the prime accused in the Madan Tamang murder case was arrested from Bijanbari last night.        
	Nickole Tamangs arrest comes a day before the Morcha is set to hold official-level talks in Delhi over the proposed interim set-up for the Darjeeling hills.         
	A contractor by profession, the accused, who is known to be an old friend of Morcha president Bimal Gurung, was also part of the party delegation that met Union home minister P. Chidambaram early this year.        
	Darjeeling superintendent of police D.P. Singh said the 42-year-old Nickole had been arrested from his ancestral home at Kaijhalay, 10km from Bijanbari. We had information that he was visiting his ancestral house last night, said Singh.        
	The police officer said the accused had been frequenting the area, occasionally entering Nepal through the porous border. He told us that he had mostly been moving around in the adjoining areas and had also entered Nepal, said Singh.         
	The arrest is being considered a breakthrough as the CID, which is handling the case, had earlier claimed that it had recovered a cellphone used allegedly by Nickole to orchestrate the murder at Upper Clubside motor stand on the morning of May 21.         
	Nickole, the ninth person to be arrested in the case, has been charged with murder and conspiracy. He was produced in the court of the chief judicial magistrate in Darjeeling amid tight security and remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.         
	The Morcha leadership did not issue any statement on the arrest. But Bharati Tamang, wife of the slain ABGL leader Madan Tamang, demanded that the accused should be given the death penalty. He should be hanged, she said.        
	ABGL supporters demonstrated in the court here where Nickole was produced. They also set up a blockade on Hill Cart Road for 45 minutes.         
	Bail rejected        
	A division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice Mrinal Kanti Chowdhury of Calcutta High Court today rejected the bail petition of Sudesh Rai Maji, an accused in the Madan Tamang murder case. Maji had been arrested from Darjeeling on June 6.

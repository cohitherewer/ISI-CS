  - PM to visit third time in seven months          K.P. NAYAR                            Singh, Obama                                
	Washington, Jan. 24: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will arrive in Washington on April 12 and stay for two days on his third visit to the US in seven months.        
	The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) took the final decision this weekend on accepting an invitation from President Barack Obama to attend the Global Nuclear Security Summit to be hosted by the White House on April 12 and 13.        
	For the first time since Obama was sworn in, Singh will not be weighed down by any concerns about some of the Obama administrations key policies that affect India when he goes to the White House for a working dinner on April 12 that will mark the start of the summit.         
	A severe political setback to Obama last week with the loss of Edward Kennedys Senate seat from Massachusetts will now force the President to put some of his pet proposals such as ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), on the backburner.         
	India has been concerned ever since Obamas victory in the 2008 presidential election that a US ratification of the CTBT will result in international pressure on New Delhi to sign and ratify the treaty.         
	But with the loss of the Massachusetts seat and the crippling loss of a filibuster-proof 60-seat majority that is needed for Obamas key initiatives, the Democratic Partys Senate leadership will no longer have the stomach to mobilise enough support on Capitol Hill to ratify the CTBT.         
	For ratifying treaties, 67 votes  not just 60  are needed in the 100-member Senate. There is no way Obama can muster that number during the rest of his presidential term, unless he turns into Midas and pulls Americans out of the economic mess they are in, a miracle that would send the Presidents popularity soaring.        
	The Washington summit is the result of a decision by the Group of Eight (G8) countries at their summit in LAquila, Italy, in July 2009, to endorse Obamas ambitious initiative in Prague three months earlier to rid the world of nuclear weapons.        
	The Prime Minister had travelled to LAquila, where Obama offered to host a Washington summit in March this year to deal with nuclear terrorism and launch an international effort to secure vulnerable nuclear materials within four years.         
	The objectives were also to break up black markets  such as the Pakistani A.Q. Khan-led network  detect and intercept materials in transit and use financial tools to disrupt illicit trade in nuclear materials.        
	The summit has now been postponed to April. It will not directly address the problems of entering the CTBT into force, but US ratification of the treaty was part of a G8 summit statement.         
	That statement had also described the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, producing waves of concern within India then that the country would come under pressure from the G8 on the issue.        
	The Prime Minister was in Pittsburgh in September last year for a summit of the Group of Twenty (G20) countries hosted by Obama. He then visited Washington in November for bilateral meetings in the White House.         
	The PMO appears to have been persuaded to agree to a third US visit by Singh in seven months after it received crucial inputs on the composition of the April summit.        
	Indias present surmise is that Chinas President Hu Jintao will boycott the Global Nuclear Security Summit in protest against a planned meeting between Obama and the Dalai Lama in the White House in the coming weeks. Such a meeting and a package of arms sales to Taiwan that is said to be on the cards are part of the Obama administrations efforts to deflect criticism of weakness in its foreign policy which has contributed to the Presidents recent political setbacks.        
	Beijing, which never takes anything lying down, is expected to hit back at Obama by refusing to attend the April summit, according to one view in the PMO.        
	A Chinese absence will make India the most important emerging power, a star, at the summit.         
	Preparations have already begun here on how Singhs presence in Washington can be used for advancing Indo-US bilateral engagement as a follow-up to the Prime Ministers November visit to the White House.

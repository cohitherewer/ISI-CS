                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Hyperbole about Indian company use of H-1B visas
                            
	Washington, Aug 16 (PTI): Corporate America has come down heavily against all those in US who of late have been alleging that Indian companies grab most of the H-1B work visas thus taking away most jobs from Americans.              
	In a latest report on immigration, US Chamber of Commerce, which is worlds largest chamber with more than three million members, asserted that such an allegation against Indian companies is quot;hyperbole quot;.              
	 quot;While some have expressed fears that H-1B professionals hired by Indian companies threaten the US workforce ? or have expressed concern that Indian companies do not sponsor many of their employees for green cards ? the actual numbers are such as to make any concerns overwrought, even if using a simplistic, zero-sum view of the labour market, quot; US Chamber of Commerce said in its latest report.              
	 quot;In FY 2009, Indian tech companies used 4,809 new H-1B visas, which equals to 0.

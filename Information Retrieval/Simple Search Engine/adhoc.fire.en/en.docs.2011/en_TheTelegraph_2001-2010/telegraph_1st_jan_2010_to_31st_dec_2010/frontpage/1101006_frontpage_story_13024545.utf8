	Ranchi, Oct. 5: The board of directors for IIM-Ranchi today decided to rope in the best of professors for the new management cradle that started functioning from a temporary campus from July amid talks with a US-based consultant to help hold virtual classes for students with some of the best minds in the business.        
	IIM, Joka (Calcutta), mentor of its Ranchi counterpart, will soon publish advertisements in this regard and the process of selecting professors was expected to be finalised by the end of October.         
	We will try to bring the best of professors for IIM-Ranchi. Besides, we have finalised a US-based consultant for use of modern technology to provide up-to-date and quality education to students, the B-schools director, M. Joseph Xavier, told The Telegraph after a marathon board meeting, the second after the June meeting in Delhi.         
	Interactions with reputed professors from the US via video conferencing and web-based classes were among the several ideas the new B-School was working on.        
	Xavier, who is scheduled to join IIM-Ranchi formally from November 1, is expected to visit the capital once again in third week of this month possibly to interview potential professors.         
	Todays board meeting was chaired by IIM-Ranchi chairman R.C. Bhargava who is chairman of Maruti Suzuki India Limited, and was attended by IIM-Joka (Calcutta) director Shekhar Choudhury, state chief secretary A.K. Singh, vice chancellor of Central University of Jharkhand D.T. Khathing, IIM-Calcutta professor B.B. Chakrabarty, apart from Xavier.         
	The meeting that went on for over six hours  from 3 pm to 9 pm  discussed several vital issues, including creating adequate infrastructure so that more students could be admitted for the two-year management course from the 2011 session and the creation of a website and logo for IIM-Ranchi.        
	It was unanimously decided that IIM-Ranchi wants to produce leaders and entrepreneurs and not only simple MBAs, disclosed Xavier.         
	IIM-Ranchi began classes from July with a batch of only 44 students from its Suchana Bhavan, a building owned by the state information and public relation department. At present, it offers a two-year postgraduate programme in management (PGPM).         
	Authorities have identified a 200-acre plot at Nagri in the outskirts of the city. Today, the board also discussed ways of getting possession of the land with the help of the state government.         
	Facilities at neighbouring Sri Krishna Sinha Institute of Public Administration is being used to house IIM students.         
	Xavier said that a few short-term courses for executives would be started by next year, adding that funds would not be an issue while building the permanent campus that promises to offer world class facilities for students.        
	He also applauded the role of IIM-Joka in helping the new institute in its initial phase.

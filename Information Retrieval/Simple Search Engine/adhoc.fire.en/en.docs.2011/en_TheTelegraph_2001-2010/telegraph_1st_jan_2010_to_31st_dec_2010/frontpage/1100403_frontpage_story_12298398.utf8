The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Drop the graduation gown
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Drop the graduation gown
          RASHEED KIDWAI                
	Bhopal, April 2: Jairam Ramesh today gave the graduation gown a dressing down.        
	The environment minister declared at a Madhya Pradesh convocation that the academic square hat and gown worn at such events was barbaric, almost echoing the states ruling BJP whose ministers had dubbed the dress a sign of colonial slavery.        
	Ramesh rooted for something more Indian. Why do we stick to the barbaric dress? Why cant we have a simple dress for such functions? Ramesh asked the organisers of the convocation at Bhopals Indian Institute of Forest Management where he was the chief guest.         
	The dress, which Indian universities would have picked up from the Oxford and Cambridge tradition, does not suit the Indian weather, he added, before going on to question the need for such ceremonies.         
	Such convocations are boring. We must live with the times, Jairam said, discarding his square hat and red-yellow gown.         
	Perhaps, the minister had found the mortarboard irritating as it had spoilt his carefully arranged hair. Later, he declared that the tradition of throwing the mortarboard in the air was also uncalled for. Students were, nonetheless, seen doing exactly that in celebration of their Kodak moment.        
	There is hardly a middle-class Indian family that doesnt proudly flaunt the picture of at least one of its members in graduation gear in the living room cupboard or on the wall. If that is a sign of its popularity, Jairams fulmination is unlikely to find an echo in Indian homes.        
	Asked if he was endorsing the BJPs demand, the minister said: Please do not create a controversy.        
	Barely a year ago, Madhya Pradesh education minister Archana Chitnis had stunned governor Rameshwar Thakur with her remarks at a convocation in Bhopal. We look like cartoons in this borrowed costume. We should redesign it to suit our cultural, geographical and climatic conditions, the BJP leader had said.        
	Industries minister Kailash Vijayvargiya saw in the dress a sign of colonial slavery. The British legacy should be replaced with something like dhoti-kurta and Rajasthani turban, and tilak should be applied on the foreheads of students, Vijayvargiya had told the convocation of Indores Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya.        
	What do the students want? For most, its a special occasion made more special by the dress.         
	Graduation couture is serious business as the query posted by a Netizen shows. I want a hot pink one with stars. Or anything sparkly. Not anything long. Any ideas or good websites? Much appreciated.        
	Shes, of course, talking about the graduation party dress. The ministers views on hot pink or sparkly are not known.

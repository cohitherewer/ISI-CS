	Kolkata, Jul 27 (PTI): Congress today expressed concern over the rise in swine flu cases in West Bengal, as 19 fresh positive cases were reported in the state taking the H1N1 affected toll to 61.
    An adjournment motion in this regard was today moved in the state Assembly by Congress member Asit Mal who demanded a discussion on the issue.
    However, Speaker H A Halim rejected the motion, but allowed Mal to read it out.
    Mal said people were getting panicky after learning of the death of a person and the rise in the number of the affected. The condition of two others was also serious.
    He demanded that the state government initiate measures on an emergency basis to prevent spread of the disease.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                The Mittal Monument
          AMIT ROY                                              
	London, March 31: The formal name for the 115m tall steel structure that is being built to celebrate the 2012 Olympics Games in London will be the ArcelorMittal Orbit but Indians will probably call it the Mittal Monument.        
	Not only is Lakshmi Mittal contributing 16 million of the 19.1-million cost of what will be the biggest sculpture in Britain  everything Mittal is mega, so no surprises there  but out of the 56 submissions from top artists for the design, it was an Indian who put in the winning bid.        
	Again, no surprises  the creation, which looks like a massive crane that has toppled over and twisted itself round and round to resemble a hookah from the side, is that of sculptor Anish Kapoor.        
	 The Mittal Monument, for it is just as well to start calling it that, is taller than the Statue of Liberty (95m) and Nelsons Column (51m). But the real comparison in a historical sense ought to be with the Victoria Memorial, Lord Curzons gift to Calcutta.        
	Mittal is still, at heart, a Calcutta boy with a floppy St Xaviers College haircut and this is his gift to London. Whether Londoners will take to it in the way Calcutta folk now consider the Victoria Memorial to be a much-loved part of the citys landscape remains to be seen. It will probably be acquired taste.        
	It ought to be pointed out that the first reaction has been gushingly positive. The London Evening Standard, which wangled an exclusive on the story, said in an editorial this afternoon: The Orbit, the extraordinary, asymmetric steel sculpture that Anish Kapoor has designed for the 2012 Olympics will be a marvel of artistic flamboyance.        
	 The paper added: Others too deserve praise for bringing the project this far: Lakshmi Mittal, the British-Indian billionaire who is donating the steel for the structure, and, not least, Cecil Balmond, the engineering partner in the project. Boris Johnson, the mayor, who secured the sponsorship of Mr Mittal, is right to say that even at a time of rigid financial restraint in respect of the Games, the Orbit is a worthwhile investment in public art.         
	This is Lakshmi Mittals lasting legacy to Lakshmi Mittal.        
	It is also a clever political move. He has given over 4 million to the Labour Party. Johnson is a high-profile Tory, so this is an indirect contribution by Mittal to the Conservative cause.        
	Today, Mittal said: We set out to create a transformational piece of art that will be an iconic symbol for the Olympics and also a new landmark that will endure long after the Games themselves. London will have a bold, beautiful and magnificent sculpture that also showcases the great versatility of steel.        
	What he meant to say was something like: I am the Shah Jahan of all I survey.        
	 In feet, the 377ft (115m) attraction compares with other British landmarks including the London Eye, which stands at 443ft (135m) and Big Ben, which is 315ft (96m).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bribery jolt to BJP from Ramdev
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bribery jolt to BJP from Ramdev
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                            Baba Ramdev                                   
	Lucknow, Nov. 20: Baba Ramdev has alleged a bribe demand by an Uttarakhand minister two years ago, staggering the ruling BJP at a time it is trying to corner the Congress over the 2G spectrum scandal.        
	The yoga gurus allegation came on Thursday, just three days after Ratan Tatas hint about a Union ministers Rs 15-crore demand over an airline deal in 1997.        
	Political circles have in recent months been abuzz with speculation that Ramdev plans to float his own political party next year and contest the 2012 Uttarakhand polls on an anti-corruption plank.        
	Like Tata, the yoga guru did not name the minister concerned.        
	I was asked by an Uttarakhand minister from Hardwar two years ago to pay a bribe of Rs 2 crore to set up a new trust, Ramdev told a yoga camp in Gonda in Uttar Pradesh.        
	When I complained to the chief minister, I was told that the minister should not have asked for a bribe but for a donation.        
	In 2008, the chief minister was B.C. Khanduri (who was replaced by Romesh Pokhriyal in June last year). Khanduri today denied that Ramdev had met him after the alleged bribe demand.        
	Baba should approach a neutral investigating agency and bring that minister to book. He should not merely create confusion, Khanduri told The Telegraph.        
	Ramdev, who is now in Basti district of Uttar Pradesh, today said his intention was not to target an individual minister. Corruption is endemic in our system and if I join politics, I will do that with a mission to end this menace, he said.        
	BJP spokesperson Mukesh Mahendru, however, insisted that Ramdev name the minister. His comments came as the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress today held street demonstrations in Uttarakhand asking the corrupt BJP government to step down.        
	BJP leaders claim that Ramdev wants to create a vote bank among the upper castes in Uttarakhand as well as Uttar Pradesh, where too he wants to contest polls in the near future.        
	They are even more alarmed that the yoga guru is strengthening his already close ties with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh while undermining the BJP, after enjoying years of patronage from the Uttarakhand government.              
	Ramdev recently held a series of yoga camps in Uttar Pradesh, coinciding them with Sangh meetings across the state, and virtually followed sarsanghachalak Mohan Bhagwat wherever he went.        
	He is wooing the Sangh and even offering it help to open new shakhas, but is all the while criticising BJP leaders, a BJP source complained.        
	In Lucknow, state BJP leaders today told the visiting national president, Nitin Gadkari, that Ramdevs political ambitions might spoil the partys revival plans in the heartland.        
	Gadkari, here to chalk out the revival road map, did not make any statement against Ramdev but party leaders are maintaining their distance from the yoga guru.

  Modi tweet opens IPL   can of worms          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Shashi Tharoor with Sunanda. File picture                                              
	Mumbai, April 12: Shashi Tharoors friend Sunanda Pushkar was given free equity by IPL Kochi and the junior foreign minister advised against prying into the consortiums ownership, Lalit Modi has disclosed on Twitter.        
	The claim by the IPL commissioner has sucked the junior foreign minister into the biggest controversy in his short but tumultuous political career.        
	Modis revelation, which has prompted the Kochi team consortium led by Rendezvous to threaten to sue the IPL commissioner, raises the question why an acquaintance of a minister was given free equity and brings under strain Tharoors assertion so far that his role in the consortium was limited to that of a mentor.        
	Wielding the same weapon that pitchforked Tharoor to the top of the popularity charts, Modi used Twitter with devastating effect on Sunday.        
	A tweet by one of Modis followers Roshan Dev LalitKModi asked: Does sashi tharoor owns (sic!) something??        
	In an uncharacteristic display of candour, Modi tweeted back: a big? I was told by him not to get into who owns rendezvous. Specially Sunanda Pushkar. Why? The same has been minuted in my records.        
	25% of kochi team is given free to Rendezvous sports for life. The same equity is non dilutable in perpetuity. What does that mean? Why? Wait Who are the shareholders of rendezvous. And why have they been given this 100s of million dollar bonanza?        
	Kochi shareholders are: Rendezvous 25% free, Rendezvous 1%, Anchor 27%, Parinee 26%, Film waves combine 12%, Anand Shyam 8%, Vivek venugopal 1%.        
	 Rendezvous free equity - held by kisan, shailender amp; pushpa gaikwad, Sunanda pushkar, Puja gulathi, jayant kotalwar, vishnu prasad, sundip agarwal.         
	Sunanda, who has been seen with Tharoor at several places, including in Guwahati last week, is said to have been given an 18 per cent stake in the Kochi team. But sources close to Tharoor in Kerala claimed the stake was no more than 4.7 per cent, which they justified as sweat equity, keeping future contributions in mind.        
	The size of the stake is immaterial as the key question is why a member of a consortium that paid as much as Rs 1,533 crore will give away a part of its shares free to a person who is closely associated with Tharoor. The minister did not respond to questions on the issue today.        
	Those who have been gifted such free equity include Kochi team CEO and Rendezvous promoter Shailendra Gaekwad. IPL sources said Gaekwad, also known as Pradeep Gaekwad, was a close friend of a top Indian cricketer.        
	He was born and brought up in Maharashtras Sholapur town. He owns a small auto agency there. His wife works with the Road Transport Office in Pune, said an IPL source.        
	The Companies Act has no provisions for any free equity (shares given to an individual or company for free). Free shares can only be given to an existing shareholder as a reward. Or they can be given as a bonus but will have to be proportionately divided among all shareholders.        
	But such rules do not apply if a company is not registered in India. IPL sources said it was unclear whether Rendezvous was registered in India or abroad.        
	Tharoor, who had run into controversies earlier over his tweets, had said the day the consortium won the franchise for his home state: All I did on my part was to offer encouragement, blessings and expert advice when required to the bidders. Beyond that, I had no role to play.        
	The articulate minister, who had sought the advice of BJP leader and lawyer Arun Jaitely on the auction process, had added: I am not even sure whether I know all of them, nor do I have any knowledge of the decision that how much they were going to bid. I know this Rendezvous Sports World and had met the Gaekwad brothers. I have given them all kind of encouragement but my role was limited. It was like...what shall I say...mentor sounds too grand a word.        
	The sources said the BCCI had washed its hands of Modi, who has been accused of breaching trust and violating a confidentiality clause. Rendezvous has sent a letter to the board in which it has threatened to sue Modi.        
	The Tharoor camp believes Modi or someone close to him wanted to buy the Kochi team and the tweets are part of a continuing attempt to derail the consortium.        
	The Kochi team won the IPL franchise through a second auction on March 23 after the first on March 9 was cancelled because of inadequate bidders.        
	Consumer goods company Videocon was the only group to make a successful bid at the first auction in Mumbai but the IPL governing council eventually overruled Modi and cancelled the round.        
	Later, Videocon had to bow to Sahara and Rendezvous at the auction held in Chennai on March 23. Sahara, with the highest bid of $370 million, had bagged Pune, and Rendezvous, with the second highest figure of $333 million, had picked up Kochi, leaving Videocon at third place with its $319.9-million bid.        
	Had the Rendezvous deal, which has been signed with the BCCI, for Kochi fallen through for some reason, Videocon would have inherited Kochi.        
	According to the terms of the IPL tender for the two new teams, if Rendezvous fails to sign the contract with the BCCI within 30 days of submitting the bid, Videocon, the third highest bidder, would become the new owner of the Kochi team, said an IPL source.        
	Although the deal has been signed, the consortiums detractors are hoping that a controversy might force the board to take a relook.                    WITH INPUTS FROM JOHN MARY

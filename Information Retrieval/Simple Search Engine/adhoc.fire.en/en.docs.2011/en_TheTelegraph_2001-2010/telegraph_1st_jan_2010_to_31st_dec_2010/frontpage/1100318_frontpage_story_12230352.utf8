	New Delhi, March 17: Astronomers today announced the discovery of a planet orbiting a Sun-like star in a distant constellation, but showing features strikingly similar to those of the solar system planets.         
	The planet, Corot-9b, is a new addition to the steadily expanding catalogue of some 400 known extrasolar planets, but it is the first extrasolar planet to have an orbit similar to that of Mercury, and the size of Jupiter.         
	The new planet also has an internal composition of mostly hydrogen and helium, resembling the solar systems gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, an international team reported today. The findings will appear in the journal Nature on Thursday.         
	Its like spotting a member of our own family orbiting a distant star, said Hans Deeg, an astronomer at the European Northern Observatories in the Canary Islands and the lead author of the paper. The mass, density, size and temperatures on the planet are similar to conditions observed on planets in our own solar system, Deeg said from his observatory in the Canary Islands.         
	The planet orbits a star similar to the Sun in the constellation Serpens so far away that its light takes 1,500 years to reach the Earth. The astronomers found the planet through observations with a French planet-hunting satellite and ground telescopes.         
	Among the 400 extrasolar planets discovered over the past 15 years, 70 transit across the face of their stars and allow scientists to study their features and investigate their atmospheres.         
	While most of the 70 transiting planets have orbits so close to their stars that their temperatures range between 1000C and 2000C, the temperature on the surface of Corot-9B is expected to range between 160C and minus 20C.         
	Corot-9bs temperature is much lower  it is a completely different climate, said Claire Moutou, a team member in Marseilles, France. This can have huge impacts on the planets interior and atmosphere, Moutou said.         
	A few extrasolar planets catalogued in the past appear to have features similar to planets in the solar system. Astronomers have found at least two rocky extrasolar planets, but both are different from any planet in the solar system.         
	Moutou said the exact atmospheric composition was not known yet, but the researchers believe Corot-9b could have water and rock at high temperatures and pressures deep beneath its gas clouds.         
	The Corot satellite identified the planet after 145 days of observations during the summer of 2008. Astronomers followed up these initial observations with ground studies from a European Southern Observatory telescope in Chile.

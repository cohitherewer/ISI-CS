  - Litigation policy to toe national line        A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, June 26: Assam will soon frame a litigation policy to bring down the number of cases pending in courts, along the lines of the National Litigation Policy.         
	This was announced by D.K. Mahanta, secretary, judicial department, Assam, at the regional meeting of chief justices, law ministers and law secretaries here today.         
	The meeting discussed action plans for effective utilisation of the grants given by the 13th Finance Commission, e-courts project and other issues in the Northeast.         
	The National Litigation Policy aims to reduce the cases pending in various courts of the country under the National Legal Mission to bring down the average pendency time from 15 years to three years.         
	Mahanta said there would be morning/evening courts in nine districts of Assam and rules are being framed for this purpose. We welcome the proposed training for public prosecutors but the problem is that there is no permanent cadre of public prosecutors in the state, he said.        
	The 13th Finance Commission has allocated Rs 5,000 crore for improved delivery of justice, which has been recommended for lok adalats and legal aid, alternate dispute resolution centres, heritage court buildings, State Judicial Academy and training of judicial officers and public prosecutors.         
	Mahanta said there would be two more CBI courts and three additional family courts.        
	Union law minister Veerappa Moily, who attended the deliberations, said the Centre had come out with a National Litigation Policy and it was incumbent on the states to have their own litigation policies.         
	The purpose of the new policy is also to reduce the government litigation cases in the courts so that more time could be devoted in resolving other pending cases.         
	He said a scheme for providing justice to undertrials, which is a silent revolution in judiciary, has brought out good results. More than one lakh undertrials, who were languishing in various courts, have been released. The scheme is being implemented in consonance with various high courts of the country and is aimed at decongesting jails.         
	Everything is possible and we have the most willing judiciary in the country, Moily added.         
	The Chief Justice of Gauhati High Court, Madan B. Lokur, said the judicial system should look after and cater to the majority of people.        
	Officials from the law departments of various states of the Northeast put forward their views on the schemes proposed in the 13th Finance Commission in the meet.         
	The Meghalaya officials said evening courts scheme would not work, as its gets dark early in the hill state and there is a shortage of trained judicial officers.         
	Officials from Sikkim said there was no requirement of fast track courts in the state as the number of pending cases are low.        
	Mizoram officials said they supported morning courts as they had cases of prohibition to deal with.         
	States of the Northeast demanded a 90:10 funding pattern for getting assistance from the ministry of law and justice.

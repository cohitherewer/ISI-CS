          OUR BUREAU                                         
	Calcutta, May 30: Mamata Banerjee will not need the support of the Congress to rule Calcutta, a STAR Ananda-AC Nielsen exit poll has predicted.         
	It gives Trinamul 78 seats, the Left 53 and the Congress only seven in the civic polls held today in a largely peaceful atmosphere, sticky and still as any May day amid breezy talk of winds of change.         
	As the Left had led the 2005 civic tally with 75 seats, followed by Trinamul and its allies 45 and 19 for the Congress and its partners, the exit poll does indicate a change of guard in the citys smaller red building.         
	The winds of change were less visible in Salt Lake as the pollsters predicted 14 seats for Trinamul and 11 for the Left, indicating a close contest.         
	Exit poll results in India have gone wrong several times in the past, but the forecast for Calcutta is close to Trinamuls internal assessment of 80-plus seats. In the two rounds of opinion polls STAR Ananda and AC Nielsen had conducted before the polls, the Trinamul tally had varied between 75 and 80.         
	Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said: We dont want to comment on these opinion or exit poll results. But we are confident of forming the board on our own.         
	CPM leaders also reserved comment on the exit poll results, collated on the basis of interviews of 235 people each in 70 wards in Calcutta and 10 wards in Salt Lake.         
	Mohammad Salim, a CPM central committee member, said: It is difficult to comment on the result now as the polling is just over. We will assess the percentage of votes polled in each ward tomorrow and only then can we have a clear picture.        
	The state Election Commission said around 75 per cent voters exercised their democratic right in Calcutta while the turnout was around 69 per cent in Salt Lake. In 79 other civic bodies spread over 15 districts, the turnout was also around 75 per cent.         
	The final turnout figures for Calcutta will be available not before midnight as polling will continue late into the evening. But the trends available till 5pm suggest that the turnout this time will be almost the same as that of 2005, said Mira Pande, the state election commissioner.         
	Data available with the commission reveal that the turnout in Calcutta has hovered around 70 to 75 per cent in the last few elections.         
	As conventional wisdom in psephology suggests that a higher than average turnout indicates an anti-incumbency wave, the Left mood was upbeat till around 1.30pm when polling was about 40 per cent. The turnout peaked in the last one-and-a-half hours, taking the figure to around 75 per cent.         
	A change of guard is possible even without a marked spike in polling percentage if major swings are visible in voting patterns, said Shiloo Chattopadhyay, a leading market researcher.         
	Besides, one should remember that, though the percentage has remained the same, the set of voters has changed.        
	The exit poll has predicted sharp swings  11 per cent away from the Left and 17.8 per cent in favour of Trinamul from 2005.         
	The depletion of the Lefts support base is starker in Salt Lake, where it has lost around 13.8 per cent voters from its 2005 performance, while over 16.8 per cent have swung in favour of Trinamul. In both Calcutta and Salt Lake, the swing against the Congress is around 2 per cent.        
	If the actual results pan out the way the exit poll predicts, Mamata will not only have evicted the CPM from the Calcutta corporation but also have taught the Congress and its state president Pranab Mukherjee a lesson.        
	The civic polls have been seen as a test case for the Left-Opposition battle in the Assembly polls scheduled in a year. But it is also as much a contest of one-upmanship between Mamata and Pranab who failed to clinch an alliance this time.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 1: When in Bengal, pack two suitcases.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram will squeeze both Burdwan and Lalgarh into his tentative weekend itinerary in an apparent balancing act to humour ally Mamata Banerjee and pre-empt flak from adversary CPM.        
	The Union minister is scheduled to be in Bengal on Saturday and Sunday but the programme could be advanced by a day if rain disrupts his visit to Arunachal Pradesh tomorrow.         
	While it was announced yesterday that Chidambaram could visit Lalgarh on Sunday, it emerged today that the tour of the Maoist battle zone would be preceded by a trip to Burdwan  a theatre of war between the Trinamul Congress and the CPM  on Saturday.        
	Congress ally and railway minister Mamata Banerjee had called on Chidambaram yesterday. Sources said she insisted that the home minister  who in December had sent an inspection team that disappointed her by staying put in Calcutta  make a trip to Burdwan.        
	Didi met the Union home minister yesterday and told him that the CPM was on the rampage in several parts of Burdwan district, particularly in Mangalkot and Raina, and was killing Trinamul workers. She requested him to visit Burdwan and reminded him that the central team did not go to trouble-torn Khanakul in Hooghly last year, an MP said.        
	Caught between a rock and a hard place, the Union minister apparently packed into his schedule, besides the Lalgarh trip, a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings to discuss law and order and the Maoist menace in West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura. His visit to Lalgarh is being seen as an attempt to convince potential critics that the Centre is not indifferent to the deaths of CPM activists in the Maoist-infested areas.         
	Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen and director-general of police Bhupinder Singh are likely to accompany Chidambaram to Lalgarh.        
	CPM leaders said they would have preferred the Union minister not going to Burdwan. But they added that the chief minister had advised caution, asking them to wait for Chidambarams pronouncements after the visit.

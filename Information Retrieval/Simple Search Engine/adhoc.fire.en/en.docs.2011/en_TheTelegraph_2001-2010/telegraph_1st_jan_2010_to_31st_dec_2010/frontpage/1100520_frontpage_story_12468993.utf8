The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 3G bounty for govt, burden for winners 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                3G bounty for govt, burden for winners 
  - Money mountain gives Pranab elbow room          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	May 19: The government appeared to be the only winner after a frenzied, 34-day auction of 3G radiowaves enabled it to rake in Rs 67,719 crore (about $15 billion)  almost twice the amount it had budgeted for.        
	Seven telecom players bid almost Rs 51,000 crore to grab 20-year licences for scarce radio waves and the right to offer 3G services in the country. Under the rules, the soonest that they can offer the service is September 1, though it is unlikely that any player will have the infrastructure in place by then.        
	The state-owned telecom players Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam  did not participate in the auction but were granted the same 5 Mhz of spectrum in the 2.1 gigahertz band like everyone else. They will have to match the auction bids for the circles where they offer the services. Their combined payout works out to a little over Rs 16,750 crore.        
	The crazy bids for Mumbai and Delhi circles  both circles saw bids well above Rs 3,000 crore  left some telecom players complaining about a winners curse. It also stoked concerns that the carriers could try and recoup some of the fees by charging high rates for a service that promises lightning quick video and data downloads.        
	The bid amounts are comparable to the global rates these scarce radiowaves have commanded. In 2008, the US raised $18 billion from spectrum auction. The UK raised more than 36.1 billion euros. Germany raked in 50.1 billion euros.        
	None of the operators could grab licences for all 22 telecom circles in India. However, Bharti Airtel, Reliance Communications and Aircel won the licences for 13 circles each.        
	Bharti Airtel will have to fork out the maximum amount of Rs 12,295.46 crore as it went for the lucrative circles. It, however, failed to get a licence for Calcutta where it has a robust 2G service  and bemoaned the fact that the high bids in Mumbai and Delhi had scuppered its hopes of getting a pan-India licence.        
	The government sold three slots in 17 circles, and four in the remaining five circles. Delhi saw the highest bid at Rs 3,316.93 crore, followed by Mumbai at Rs 3,247.07 crore.        
	The revenue earned from 3G auction provides me with some elbow room (in containing the fiscal deficit), said finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. In the budget, he had estimated a revenue inflow of Rs 35,000 crore from the sale of both 3G and broadband wireless spectrum.        
	Auction for wireless broadband spectrum will start on Friday.

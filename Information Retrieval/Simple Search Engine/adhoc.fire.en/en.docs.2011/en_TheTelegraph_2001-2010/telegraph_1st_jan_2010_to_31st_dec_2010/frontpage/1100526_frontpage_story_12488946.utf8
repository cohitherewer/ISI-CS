  - Manmohan effect: Bengal civic poll pot boils          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Pranab at the meeting.  Picture by Bishwaroop Dutta    
	Calcutta, May 25: Pranab Mukherjee has launched a scathing attack on Mamata Banerjee four days ahead of the civic polls in Bengal.        
	On one hand, she says she would remain with the coalition government at the Centre, while on the other, she says that only two parties will exist in Bengal. This cannot be accepted, the Bengal Congress chief said tonight without naming Mamata.        
	Then what will the other parties do? Tara ki ghas katbe (will they cut grass)? he asked. After all, one cannot deny the historical fact that a multi-system exists in India, he told a campaign meeting in north Calcutta.        
	Mukherjees ire apparently followed Mamatas persistent efforts to polarise the civic polls into a contest between the ruling Left Front and her Trinamul Congress.        
	In campaign meetings for over a fortnight, the Trinamul leader has been urging the electorate against voting for those who have entered the fray to strengthen the CPM.        
	All through his hour-long speech, Mukherjee trained his guns on Mamata for not adhering to jot dharma.        
	Referring to the Lok Sabha poll alliance, Mukherjee said: We had a political compulsion in 2009. That is why, out of 42 seats, we agreed to contest only 14, leaving 28 seats to Trinamul. I worked out the alliance despite the fact that there was some resentment among our party ranks. And people voted for the alliance. But if somebody thinks that she won the elections on her own, its wrong.

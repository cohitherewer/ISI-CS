	Aug. 7: Two Calcutta boys returning from a school excursion in a group fell off their reserved train coach, packed with pilgrims who had boarded illegally, one of them dying on the tracks and the other left grievously injured.        
	Yesterdays 11pm tragedy near Sonepur in Bihar happened at a time Trijit Karmakar and Shamik Debnath, Class IX students of El Bethel School in Thakurpukur, had been forced to stand near the door with Shravani Mela pilgrims crowding the Bagh Express coach, Sonepur OC G.M. Pandey said.        
	P.R. Debnath, father of the injured Shamik, said from Patna where his son is being treated: Trijit and Shamik spotted a young boy hanging precariously from the door. They pulled him inside and, in the act, themselves fell off.        
	Trijit, 15, came under the wheels and was declared dead at a hospital in Sonepur, 40km from Patna, this morning. Shamik was shifted to Patna Medical College and Hospital with a dislocated right arm and a broken left arm.        
	Trijits father Jayanta has lodged a police complaint of negligence against the school, whose representatives on the train appeared to have realised the boys were missing only at 1am, and whom the railways accused of being late in informing them.        
	The boys lay on the tracks till police, informed by local people, arrived in the morning and Shamik gave them his mothers phone number.        
	Arup Chakraborty, one of the teachers escorting the 70 students returning from a trip to Kasauni in Uttar Pradesh, said that after they realised the two boys were missing, they informed the railway guard at Hajipur station, the next stop. An East Central Railway official, however, claimed the railways were not informed either at Hajipur or the next major stop, Muzaffarpur.         
	Shamiks mother called the school this morning, vice-principal Gobindo Chandra Deb said. (After that) I and school assistant Pradip Ghosh got off in Asansol and took the Poorva Express to Patna, Chakraborty said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           Lagadapati Rajagopal        
	New Delhi, Dec. 13: The deadlocked winter session of Parliament ended with a Lok Sabha MP locking himself up in the House for over five hours this afternoon.         
	The histrionic subplot to the unprecedented session-long disruption began to unfold when it was discovered that Lagadapati Rajagopal, Congress MP from Vijayawada, had managed to steal himself away from marshals eyes after the Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die and bolt the doors from within.        
	 He wasnt prepared to leave until he was allowed to raise certain issues, he insisted. No amount of reason, it seemed, would persuade him to end his solitary sit-in.         
	Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar and parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal had to personally intervene before Rajagopal agreed to drop the curtains on his five-hour drama.         
	Bansal had to bring him tea and Meira Kumar had to employ all her talents at prayer and pleading before he opened up and ended his protest, a Lok Sabha official said. In the beginning, he seemed intent on having his way, he put the fright in us for a while.         
	But then, Rajagopal, a businessman-turned-politician with declared personal assets worth Rs 300 crore, has a way of grabbing attention that few can rival. Last year, he had gone on a fast-unto-death and a cat-and-mouse game with police, protesting against Telangana and even resigned.        
	Sources said he had arrived in Parliament this morning set on making a scene to catch the limelight. His first move, apparently, was to resign his Lok Sabha seat in protest against the Oppositions sustained disruptions. Rajagopal could not be contacted to confirm whether he had sent in his resignation but it is learnt he did at one point resign.        
	 Like his previous resignation on Telangana, though, this too was quietly retracted.

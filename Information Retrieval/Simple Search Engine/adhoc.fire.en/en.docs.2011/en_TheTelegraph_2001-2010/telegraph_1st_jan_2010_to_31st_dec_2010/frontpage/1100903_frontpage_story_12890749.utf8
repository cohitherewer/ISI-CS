The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | SC grain order exceeds jurisdiction limits: Somnath
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                SC grain order exceeds jurisdiction limits: Somnath
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                      Somnath Chatterjee                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: Former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today said the Supreme Courts order to the Centre to distribute foodgrain to the poor free has exceeded all limits of jurisdiction.        
	Chatterjee said the directive was another example of a well-intentioned order that could not be implemented.        
	I am surprised, he told The Telegraph over the phone. I wish the court had given some thought to how the order can be implemented.        
	The Supreme Court had on Tuesday clarified that it had issued an order, not made a suggestion, to the food ministry to distribute free to the poor grain as stocks are overflowing and rotting.        
	With all due respect, the intention (of the court) was good, but there are other institutions to take care of it, said Chatterjee, himself a barrister. This is just the type of activism which creates problems for everybody.        
	Every judicial order, he said, should be capable of being implemented. That is the simplest test of a good judicial order. The Supreme Court order on foodgrain cannot be implemented, he said.        
	The courts order has exceeded all limits of jurisdiction, Chatterjee said, adding that it interfered with the governments functioning.        
	Every constitutional authority has to have a proper role perception, he said, alluding to the huge pendency of cases in the judiciary.        
	There are so many pending cases but can any other agency say we are going to take over and dispose of these cases? Chatterjee wondered. If supposedly one wing is not functioning, does it mean another will take over? he asked.        
	If the army is not being deployed properly, will the court tell it or the NSG how to function? Will the Supreme Court now tell the government how to control the Maoists? he asked. If the government fails, the people have to change the government, said Chatterjee.        
	Former law minister Shanti Bhushan agreed with Chatterjee. The Supreme Court order is well-intentioned but transgresses all limits. It is not for the Supreme Court to say what policy should be followed, he said.         
	The top court, he said, was right in getting disturbed over images of food rotting in the country while the poor starved. But it was not right in passing an order asking the government to provide the grain free to the poor, he said.         
	It is a complex problem but the government is there to deal with it, Bhushan said. The court can pass specific orders if a poor person, who is entitled to food through the public distribution system but doesnt get it, approaches it for relief.        
	But in this case, the government has no policy of providing free foodgrain, he pointed out.        
	Other legal experts, who did not wish to be named, said it was high time the government made a concerted attempt to wrest the jurisdiction ceded over the years to the judiciary.        
	 They cited a case in which the court has been monitoring forests since 1995. That special bench has over the years dealt with problems of diversion of forest land for non-forest use. It has also imposed a tax for such diversion.

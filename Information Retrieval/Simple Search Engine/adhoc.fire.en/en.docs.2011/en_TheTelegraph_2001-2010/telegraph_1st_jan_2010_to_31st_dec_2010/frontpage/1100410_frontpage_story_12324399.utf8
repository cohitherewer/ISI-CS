The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Iran unveils faster centrifuges
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Iran unveils faster centrifuges
                                Ahmadinejad in Tehran. (AP)                            
	Tehran, April 9 (AP): Iran unveiled a third generation of domestically built centrifuges today as the Islamic Republic accelerates a uranium enrichment programme that has alarmed world powers.        
	The new machines are capable of much faster enrichment than those now being used in Irans nuclear facilities. Iranian officials praised the advancement as a step towards greater self-sufficiency in the face of international sanctions targeted at choking off the nuclear work.        
	During a ceremony marking Irans National Day of Nuclear Technology, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pulled back a white curtain to reveal one of the tall, cylindrical machines to a crowd of assembled dignitaries. The display capped months of announcements about the development of the new machines.        
	Ahmadinejad declared there was no way back for Irans nuclear work despite opposition from the US and other world powers, though he insisted it had only peaceful aims like power generation.        
	Iran would remain a nuclear state, he said, whether enemies want it or not.        
	President Barack Obamas announcement on Tuesday of a new American nuclear policy enraged Irans leaders because the guidelines classify Iran as a potential target for a nuclear attack.        
	Obamas policy included pledges to reduce Americas nuclear arsenal, refrain from nuclear tests and not use nuclear weapons against countries that do not have them.        
	Iran and North Korea were not included in that pledge because they do not cooperate with other countries on nonproliferation standards.        
	Ahmadinejad called the promised arsenal reduction a show and a big lie aimed at allowing Washington to keep the bulk of its weapons. The policy would only encourage nations to seek a nuclear military option, he said. When you threaten, you are encouraging other nations to prepare it, Ahmadinejad said.        
	The new generation of centrifuges, which spin uranium gas at extremely high speeds to purify it, will allow Iran to produce fuel for as many as six nuclear power plants, the President said.        
	The head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, said the machines were 10 times more powerful than ones now in use. The machines are at the core of Irans disputed nuclear programme. Enrichment technology is of concern to the international community because it can be used to generate fuel for power stations or material for nuclear bombs.        
	 The United States and its allies suspect Irans civilian work is        
	a cover for developing a weapons capability. With more advanced        
	centrifuges, Iran can more rapidly amass enriched material that        
	could be turned into the fissile core of warheads, should Tehran        
	choose to do so.        
	 Ahmadinejad said Iran would not go down that path.        
	 quot;We oppose the atomic bomb; we have announced it many times, quot;        
	he said. Those pursuing the bomb were foolish because quot;the era of        
	superiority based on the A-bomb is over, quot; he added.        
	 Irans first nuclear power plant is to be inaugurated later this        
	year in the southern port of Bushehr with the help of Russia. Iran        
	says it plans to build some 20 nuclear power plants.        
	 Ahmadinejad also announced that Iran aspired in the future to        
	export nuclear technology.        
	 Seeking to support claims of nuclear self-sufficiency, Salehi,        
	the nuclear chief, said Iran recently examined a uranium deposit in        
	the center of the country with quot;a remarkable reservoir. quot;        
	 That runs counter to the belief that Iran does not have        
	significant deposits of raw uranium, making it dependent on imports.        
	 Iran has two known uranium enrichment plants and announced in        
	February that it plans to start construction this year on two more        
	facilities deep inside mountains to protect them from attack.        
	 Iran says it will install more than 50,000 centrifuges at its        
	main enrichment facility in the central town of Natanz. Currently        
	they have installed about 9,000 there.        
	 The U.S and Israel have not ruled out a military option for        
	stopping Irans nuclear program if diplomacy and sanctions fail.        
	 quot;Any hand from any point in the world will be cut before        
	extending against the Iranian nation, quot; Ahmadinejad said Friday.        
	 During the ceremony Iran also displayed dummy fuel disks made of        
	copper instead of aluminum and uranium. That marked a step toward        
	enriching uranium to a higher level of 20 percent for a medical        
	research reactor in Tehran. Higher levels of enrichment are worrying        
	to the international community because it brings Iran closer to        
	possible production of weapons-grade material.

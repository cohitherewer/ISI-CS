          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: The railways have introduced a divert clause to take away wagon orders from suppliers who miss deadlines.        
	Sources said the carrot-and-stick condition, under which satisfactory performance could be rewarded with a deal granted to a laggard rival, was aimed at ending a vicious cycle of shortfall. (See chart)        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee had voiced displeasure in Parliament over the non-performance of a section of the wagon industry, mostly located in home state Bengal.        
	The new condition, inserted in the much delayed order for the 2009-10 financial year, said 50 per cent of the order would be released now. By February 28 next year, contracted firms will have to deliver 50 per cent of their released order and clear backlog.        
	In case you fail to comply with the above condition, the railways reserve the right to cancel or divert part or full quantity of the withheld order to other performing firms, says the clause. Similarly, the order of other non-performing firms may also be diverted to you on your satisfactory performance.        
	Freight is the biggest earner for the railways and, despite the growing demand for wagons, the shortfall has been piling up. It became a vicious cycle, said an industry observer. The deficit was added to next years target. So the procurement target continued to go up.        
	The railways have around 2 lakh wagons. The demand is for around 25,000 and is expected to increase.        
	Among the companies given the orders is Cimmco, which had turned sick but was revived under a BIFR scheme with Titagarh Wagon as co-promoter. I hope Cimmco will be able to regain its past prime, said Umesh Chowdhury, Titagarh Wagon vice-chairman.

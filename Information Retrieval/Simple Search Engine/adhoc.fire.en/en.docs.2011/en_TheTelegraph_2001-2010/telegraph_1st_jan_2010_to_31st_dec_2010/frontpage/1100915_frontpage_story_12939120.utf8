The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Seasonal bird? Here comes a national reply                                                                                                                                                    1                                                                                Seasonal bird? Here comes a national reply     - Party hears a repartee, Santiniketan girls go ra-ra          OUR BUREAU                            A raft of hands, many of them girls, reaches out as Rahul Gandhi steps out of his vehicle in front of Uttarayan in Santiniketan on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta                                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 14: The Congress is not a seasonal or regional party but an all-India party, an MLA today quoted Rahul Gandhi as telling a convention in Calcutta a day after Mamata Banerjee said she was not a seasonal cuckoo.        
	Congress MLA Abdul Khaleq Mollah from Garden Reach said Rahul, who began his Bengal tour on a rousing note in Santiniketan in the morning, made the assertion about the reach of the party at a minority convention in the evening.        
	The audience at the closed-door session greeted Rahuls remarks with applause, the MLA added.        
	What Rahul said about the national character of the Congress cannot be disputed. But the reported choice of the word seasonal appears to have electrified the party rank and file who saw in it a dignified repartee to Mamatas perceived potshot in north Bengal yesterday.        
	 I am not like the proverbial koel (cuckoo) that arrives in spring and disappears once the season is over. There is consistency in my work as railway minister in north Bengal, the Trinamul chief had said.        
	Seen along with Rahuls frequent visits to Bengal, a sense of revival among Congress workers and Mamatas eagerness to break into north Bengal, many felt that her reference to the seasonal bird was an oblique admission that she was not taking lightly the Congress general secretarys forays into the state.        
	Congress sources said Rahul was briefed by party leaders about Mamatas remarks once he landed at the airport.        
	Manas Bhuniya, the Congress state president who has shown a proactive streak since taking over the reins, took a dig at Mamata without naming her. One may call Rahulji koel of the spring. But one should not forget that Rahulji is a leader of a party that has been with the people for a long 125 years, he said.        
	On the political front, Rahul picked up the thread from where he had left it on September 6. Self-respect  the theme that capped his visit last time  was the focal point on Tuesday.         
	The AICC leader told the convention that the Congress was keen to preserve the partnership with the Trinamul Congress but it would have to be based on dignity. In Bengal, we have a partnership with the TMC. We will have to walk alongside each other. But I think that if there is a partnership, it should be based on dignity. That would mean respecting the people, Rahul said.         
	He did launch a customary attack on the Left Front  change is coming, the Left is going to close shop  but the Congress ranks focused on the nature of the relationship with Trinamul.        
	Youth Congress activists and elected party representatives from Birbhum, Murshidabad, Malda, North 24-Parganas and Nadia wanted to know if the leadership would surrender to Mamata to stitch an alliance for next years Assembly polls as it did before last years Lok Sabha elections.         
	Rahulji, our leaders accepted only 14 seats out of 42 during last years Lok Sabha polls following a diktat from the Trinamul leadership. Will our leaders make a similar surrender to our alliance partner before next years Assembly polls to strike a seat-sharing deal? a source quoted Humayun Kabir, the leader of the Opposition in the CPM-controlled Murshidabad zilla parishad, as asking.        
	Kabir, along with elected representatives from Malda and Birbhum, was attending a closed-door interactive session convened by Rahul in Bolpur.         
	Asked about it later, Kabir said: When Rahulji patiently heard my arguments, I urged him to ensure that the alliance must not be struck at the cost of the partys self-esteem.

	New Delhi, Aug 25 (PTI): Around 200 people were today evacuated from the banks of Yamuna in the capital as the water level in the river touched 205.70 metres.
    With this, a total of 1,500 people have been shifted to around 160 relief camps set up by the city government to provide shelter to people living along the banks of the river.

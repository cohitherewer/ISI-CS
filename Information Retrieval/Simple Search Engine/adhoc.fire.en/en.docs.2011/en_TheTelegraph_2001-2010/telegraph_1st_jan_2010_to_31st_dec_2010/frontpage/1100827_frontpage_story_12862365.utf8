The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bus operators feel the pinch
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bus operators feel the pinch
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                               
	Ranchi, Aug. 26: Barely two months after city bus services started in Ranchi and only a fortnight after the first bus rolled on Dhanbad roads, operators have complained of financial strain, with one expressing its inability to continue.         
	Incurring losses to the tune of Rs 1,250 per bus per day, the operators in Dhanbad, Sainik Kalyan Board, today informed the state authorities, including chief secretary A.K. Singh, at a meeting in Project Building, that it wanted out.         
	The board also put in a months notice to Jharkhand Tourism Development Corporation (JTDC) the special purpose vehicle to implement urban transport system as mandated by the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM).         
	Todays meeting, chaired by the chief secretary, was attended by urban development secretary P.K. Jojoria, JTDC managing director Sidharth Tripathi and deputy commissioners and police superintendents of Ranchi, Dhanbad and East Singhbhum.        
	The chief secretary, consequently, directed the concerned deputy commissioners to redraw bus routes and fix fares accordingly, in order to make the project viable. They have also been asked to talk to other prospective agencies and work out alternatives.         
	We are trying to make the project viable and looking for options. The ambitious project should go on smoothly, the chief secretary told The Telegraph.         
	The city bus service started in Dhanbad on August 9 with a fleet of 24 vehicles. The city is to get 70 buses under JNNURM.         
	Now the only way out for the state, according to authorities, is to extend budgetary support for the smooth running of the service in the three mission cities.         
	No agency in the country, including Delhi Transport Corporation, is making profits through city bus services. The state needs to provide budgetary support, said a senior official.         
	In Ranchi, the show is being run by JTDC, which is also counting losses to the tune of Rs 850 per bus per day.         
	In the state capital, 70 buses have been plying daily on five important routes since the project was inaugurated on June 26.         
	In Jamshedpur, the third city in the state covered under JNNURM, the service is yet to start. The steel city will get a fleet of 50 buses.         
	The state administration, in the meantime, is learnt to have shelved plans to purchase more buses given the magnitude of the problem it is facing at the nascent stage itself. Earlier, 100 buses each were planned for Ranchi and Dhanbad and 50 for Jamshedpur.         
	Between December 2009 and June 2010, three abortive bids by the JTDC to finalise operators delayed the project for almost a year.

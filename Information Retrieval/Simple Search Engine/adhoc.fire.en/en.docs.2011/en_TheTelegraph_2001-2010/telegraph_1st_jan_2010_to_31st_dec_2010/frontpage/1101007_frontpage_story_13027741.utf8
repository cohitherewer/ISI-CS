          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            (Top) Bikash Sinha and Srikumar Banerjee                                 
	The scientific fraternity has made a renewed pitch for a nuclear power plant in West Bengal where the demand for power has been steadily rising.        
	More than 80 per cent of energy is produced from coal  a fuel that emits a high amount of carbon and greenhouse gases. The process is expensive and the energy source non-renewable, Bikash Sinha, the Homi Bhabha Chair professor of the department of atomic energy, said on Wednesday.        
	He was speaking at a seminar titled Power Situation in West Bengal  The Role of Nuclear Power, organised by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and the department of atomic energy (DAE), at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics.        
	According to him, coal pollution kills more than 300,000 people every year. Fears surrounding nuclear pollution is unscientific. Otherwise, the Japanese who had suffered the most after the nuclear explosion at Hiroshima and Nagasaki wouldnt have embraced nuclear power.        
	Shreyans Kumar Jain, the chairman and managing director of NPCIL, said steps were being taken to ensure that land did not become a stumbling block in the setting up of nuclear plants. The acquisition of land for all future nuclear parks, including in Haripur, will be done through a new people-friendly land acquisition policy, said Jain.         
	The price that will be offered for the land will be higher than the market rate. The price will be decided after taking into account the loss of livelihood, following consent from the affected population.        
	If required, land will be taken on lease or rent and not acquired at all. We want to bring about a sense of ownership among the people, rather than fear and apprehension, Jain said.        
	Srikumar Banerjee, the chairman of Atomic Energy Commission and secretary of the department of atomic energy, highlighted how Kudankulan, a sleepy hamlet in Tamil Nadus Tirunelveli district, morphed into a small industrial town after a nuclear power plant came up there.        
	Vocational institutes were set up to train young people so they could join the workforce of the plant. Hundreds of jobs were created, there was reverse migration, Banerjee said. The NPCIL also constructed roads and hospital and developed infrastructure there. An environment-impact assessment showed there were no detrimental effects on living beings.        
	The NPCIL is ready to adopt the Kudankulam model at Haripur with all safeguards and social responsibility in place.        
	The proposed nuclear plant in Haripur will deploy small VVER (water-cooled, water-moderated energy reactor) reactors developed through Russian technology, said Banerjee. Such light water-pressure reactors are safe and has high productivity. As Indian nuclear power plants are considered among the safest in the world, safety is our foremost concern, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Krishna faces Sonia fire for child bill delay 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Krishna faces Sonia fire for child bill delay 
          CITHARA PAUL                            Krishna Tirath                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: Child development minister Krishna Tirath has swung into action to protect children from sexual predators, but not before a rap from her party boss.        
	A letter from Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has sent Tirath scrambling to ready the final draft of a bill that seeks to address all offences against children, including sexual assault.        
	Officials in the women and child development ministry said Sonia wrote to the minister asking about the delay in preparing the final version of the Prevention of Offences Against the Child Bill, 2009. They said they were working overnight on the draft, which Tirath wants by the end of this week.        
	Sonias letter has come to light at a time Tiraths job as a minister is hanging in the balance after a series of embarrassments, the latest being rigged appointments for Doordarshan to favour several candidates, including the ministers daughter.        
	Sonia wrote to Tirath in her capacity as head of the National Advisory Council. You work in co-ordination with the law ministry to enable the finalisation of such a draft legislation so that it can be brought to Parliament expeditiously, the Congress chief said in the letter sent in the last week of August.         
	Sonia also mentioned a survey, commissioned by Tiraths ministry, which had said that over 53 per cent children in India were subjected to sexual abuse and that most were unable to report the assault to anyone. Sonia also talked about the lacunae in the justice system.        
	An official with the child development ministry said Sonias letter appeared to have made an impact. We are working overnight to fine-tune the draft as the minister has insisted that she should get the final version by the end of the week. She wants to present the draft in the next cabinet meeting.        
	Tirath couldnt be reached for comment despite repeated attempts.        
	Sources said the bill, in the making for nearly a year now, seeks to address every type of offence against children. The bill also proposes for the first time to put the onus of proving their innocence on the accused. Under existing provisions to deal with sexual assault or rape under the Indian Penal Code, the prosecution has to prove the guilt of the accused.         
	The bill also says abused children should not be forced to confront the accused while testifying and that the evidence must be recorded within a month. Other provisions include completion of the trial within a year and life term for government and army officials found guilty of child abuse. The bill also lists child pornography as an offence.         
	Sources said even if Tirath submits the final draft soon, her seat is under threat. Before Sonias letter, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, too, had expressed dissatisfaction with the performance of the ministry, especially with the Integrated Child Development Schemes that are crucial in carrying forward the governments social welfare projects.         
	Earlier, she had put the government in an embarrassing situation by publishing a photograph of a former Pakistan Air Force chief in a government advertisement.         
	The latest was the Central Administrative Tribunals move to quash the appointment of 25 news anchors and reporters for Doordarshan, including Tiraths daughter, citing irregularities and manipulations. The tribunal said rules were arbitrarily changed at the last moment to ensure the success of certain candidates who did not perform well in the written test.

  - Post-mortem of custody   death victim inconclusive        OUR BUREAU                                          
	Ranchi/Dhanbad, Nov. 23: The officer in charge of Barwaddah police station was suspended today, but the government indicated that any further action against Dhanbad police officers for the in-custody death of a Bokaro resident would depend on the report of viscera tests being conducted at a Ranchi forensic laboratory.        
	Sahdeo Prasads suspension orders were issued after the intervention of chief minister Arjun Munda yesterday amid a public outcry against the Dhanbad police for the November 17 in-custody death of 30-year-old Dhirendra Singh arrested the day before for possessing Maoist literature.        
	Coal belt DIG Umesh Prasad Singh, who issued the suspension orders, said as per norms a preliminary report regarding the custodial death had been sent to the National Human Rights Commission and inspector-general of Police Manoj Mishra within 24 hours of the incident.        
	The chief minister, it has been learnt, had directed DGP Neyaz Ahmed on November 17 before leaving for Delhi, to look into the Dhanbad custody death and take suitable action.        
	Yesterday, after JVMs coal belt MLAs Samresh Singh and Phul Chand Mandal raised the issue publicly at an Assembly function to commemorate statehood day, Munda turned to Ahmed for a status report.        
	It was then that he asked the DGP to suspend the OC and conduct a probe to unravel the truth, sources said.         
	Munda also announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to Dhirendras next of kin.         
	The state home department, in its report to the chief minister, has said that the post-mortem conducted on the body of Dhirendra failed to come to conclusion on the exact reason behind his death since there were no external or internal injuries to suggest torture or the use of third degree methods.        
	The deceased was probably suffering from some stomach problem. When his condition started deteriorating, he was first taken to a health centre and brought back. Thereafter, he was taken to a private nursing home and finally to the Patliputra Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) where he died, said a senior home department official.        
	He pointed to several doubts. Why didnt the police take him to PMCH first? Further, versions of doctors and police officers also dont match. Hence, the Barwaddah officer in charge Sahdeo Prasad has been suspended, he added. The government, he said, was now waiting for the viscera test report, likely to take about a fortnight, which is expected to throw more light on the case.        
	Chief secretary A.K. Singh maintained the government was examining every aspect of the case and promised suitable action against the guilty police officers.         
	Yesterday, Dhanbad deputy commissioner Sunil K. Burnwal ordered a magisterial inquiry to look into all aspects of the case  right from Dhirendras detention and arrest on November 16 to the events for the night leading to his death early next morning.        
	A case of unnatural death has been registered at Barwaddah police station. But, Dhirendras father Sunder Singh, has also lodged a complaint case in which he has named four police officers  SP Suman Gupta, Barwaddah OC Sahdeo Prasad, Nirsa DSP Shailendra Burnwal and Bhuli OC Harish Pathak  alleging they had tortured his son to death during questioning.        
	The JVM reacted positively to todays suspension, but threatened to hit the streets if the government failed to punish the guilty police officers. The chief minister sought two days time. He has shown good gesture by suspending Barwaddah OC. But the rest of our demands remain unattended, said Samresh Singh, JVMs Bokaro MLA.        
	The partys Sindri MLA Phul Chand Mandal, however, said he wanted the government to take action against the other police officers too.

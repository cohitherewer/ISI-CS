The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | A rough game? Take it as a salute
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                A rough game? Take it as a salute
                            
	Seeing Dunga prancing around on the touchline in a tizzy as a handful of Ivory Coast desperadoes clogged his expensive, highly paid, egotistical Brazilian players all over Soccer City on a South African Sunday night was almost funny.        
	Of course French referee Stephane Lannoy was too lenient in allowing them to get away with it and substitute Kader Keita should have been sent off earlier  within minutes of his arrival  for a shin-high assault on Michel Bastos; the Brazilian was fortunate to escape with only severe bruising and not a multiple leg fracture.        
	This, however, is nothing new. Purists may regret it but the truth is that professional football at the very highest levels is about astronomical rewards being balanced by physical risk.        
	Today, Luis Fabiano is scoring the goals which plaster his picture all over the worlds media and bring sponsors at a gallop. Yet tomorrow, his career could be over. A mistimed tackle, a bad fall, a twist of the knee, a snap of an ankle and that could be the end of it.        
	Englands Michael Owen fell when no opponent was near him in a 2006 first round outing against Sweden and damaged a knee so severely he was out of the game for a year and, arguably, has never been quite the same player since. Certainly his career has nose-dived with relegation at Newcastle being followed by a place only on the substitutes bench at Manchester United.        
	But football is a physical contact game and, at World Cup level, it is no use behaving like prima donnas just because a player wears a shirt with the logo of the Brazilian confederation on it.        
	The top players all know that they will be targeted by inferior, less-talented footballers who cannot match them for skill or talent.        
	Its a fact of football.        
	Dunga himself, in his playing days, was a midfield player whose abilities went unappreciated by many fans back in Brazil because they considered him an enforcer and not a virtuoso creative playmaker. When it came to mixing it and putting in the heavy tackles, Dunga was up there with the toughest.        
	Sir Bobby Charlton, one of the great gentleman footballers of another era (and to whose talent few of the present England squad can hold a candle) was almost never booked during his playing career and always insisted that he took rough play as an acknowledgement that he had his opponents worried.        
	Charlton, let it be said, played in an era when football was far more physically intimidating than todays game. The difference today is that the game is far quicker, hence many of the worst injuries are more complex ligament twists and strains rather than simple bone fractures.        
	Brazil should thus have taken the Ivory Coast clogging as a compliment and risen above it, shown the true nature of the champions they pretend to be. The incident in which Kaka was shown a second yellow  and thus a red  card was merely rough justice. He pushed Keita in the chest and the Ivorien fell theatrically to the ground clutching his face.        
	Play-acting? Certainly.        
	But it was only the same nasty trick with which Brazils own Rivaldo got Turkeys Hakan Unsal sent off in 2002.        
	What goes around, comes around.        
	Anyway, there may be a happy omen here to console Dunga: Brazil, in 2002, did go on to win the World Cup after all.

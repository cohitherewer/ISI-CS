  Honours even, a better start to Cup

	Africa is indeed happy; this is the African World Cup. The time for Africa has come. Ke Nako! With those words  We are ready!  South African President Jacob Zuma opened the 2010 FIFA World Cup and talked up a significant page of sporting history.        
	His own national team and unintimidated Mexico then produced one of the better Opening Matches in World Cup history with a 1-1 draw which meant honours even, and thus a happy day for everyone in Soccer City.        
	Hard to believe that two decades ago South Africa was a pariah nation. Now the worlds focus is centred on the Rainbow Nation for all the right reasons after so many wrong ones. The World Cup has taken root on African soil which surely means that, within little more than a decade, perhaps the Olympic Games may follow.        
	Nelson Mandela, Sepp Blatter, Danny Jordaan and a host of believers had the vision, ever since 1994. Now, to some relief, the time for talk, for claim and counter-claim, for excessive pessimism and over-the-top optimism, has ended. The African World Cup is a reality and the Opening Match produced worthy goals.        
	Mexico boss Javier Aguirre had declared that this was the most important match he had ever coached but it was the hosts who made the more nervy start. Mexicos Giovani dos Santos and Carlos Vela ripped the left flank of their defence to shreds. That does not augur well for their next two games; the spies will have taken note.        
	Only the alertness of keeper Itu Khune and a little luck saved South Africa from slipping behind. But the half-time break gave them a chance to understand that they had not been outclassed or outplayed. Suitably, fortified they upped the pace after the interval and went ahead through a magnificent strike from Siphiwe Tshabalala.        
	This is a player who spends much of his off-pitch searching great free-kick goals on YouTube. Now he has provided a collectors piece himself with the magisterial fashion in which he converted what may also be one of the passes of the finals from Kagisho Dikgacoi. Hence Tshabalala: first South African hero of their own World Cup.        
	One of the factors which separates the managerial men from the coaching children is the sagacity with which they use their substitutes. In Javier Aguirre Mexico have a man of the first category, in the manner of Jose Mourinho at club level.        
	Aguirre threw on all his permitted three substitutes in pursuit of an equaliser and was properly rewarded when Andres Guardado provided the angled cross which was coolly converted from close range by Rafa Marquez. A captains goal indeed for an appropriately diplomatic result.        
	As Fifa president Sepp Blatter had said before kick-off: Congratulations to the African population, congratulations to South Africa. A dream has come true. The spirit of Africa is in Soccer City.

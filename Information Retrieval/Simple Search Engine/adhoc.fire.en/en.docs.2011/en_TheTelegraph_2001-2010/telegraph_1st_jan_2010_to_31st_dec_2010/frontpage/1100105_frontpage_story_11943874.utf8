	Dubai, Jan. 4 (Reuters): Dubai opened the worlds tallest structure in a glitzy ceremony meant to put a brave face on crushing debt woes.        
	The $1.5-billion tower reaches 828 metres, 200 storeys into the sky, exceeding the next highest structure by some 300 metres. The structure, an unprecedented engineering marvel, was built with a major contribution from India, a vast labour force.        
	Dubais ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum renamed the tower Burj Khalifa after the UAE President and the ruler of emirate of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan. Emirates has made a mark on the world and Dubai has built something for the world that is built by human beings, Sheikh Mohammed said. The Burj Dubai Metro station also opened today.

          OUR BUREAU                      Crime scene investigators examine the SUV in Times Square on Saturday. (Reuters)                          
	May 2: An amateurish but potentially powerful bomb was found in a smoking vehicle on Saturday evening at New Yorks Times Square, the worlds busiest location on weekends, with some similarities to a London plot linked to a bomber from Bangalore.        
	The New York bomb  dubbed a potential terrorist attack by the US, the responsibility for which has been claimed by the Pakistan Taliban  was defused after a T-shirt vendor spotted smoke coming out of a sport utility vehicle.        
	The London plot in 2007 too did not succeed because smoke came out of the vehicle parked near a nightclub in West End. The Times Square conspirators, too, chose a site bustling with entertainment hotspots.         
	One of the alleged London plotters, Kafeel Ahmed, hailed from Bangalore and died of wounds suffered while trying to ram a fuel-packed vehicle into an airport in Glasgow the following day.        
	At Times Square on Saturday at 6.30pm  the height of dinner hour before theatre-goers head to the shows in Broadway  the car bomb apparently began to detonate but did not explode, probably because it malfunctioned.        
	The car was parked at one of the prime blocks for Broadway shows, with seven theatres housing such big shows as The Lion King and Billy Elliot.         
	Thousands of tourists were cleared from the streets for 10 hours after the T-shirt vendor alerted police about the suspicious Pathfinder, which contained three propane tanks, fireworks, two filled 19-litre gasoline containers, two clocks with batteries, electrical wire and other components, commissioner Raymond Kelly said.        
	The Taliban in Pakistan said they had planted the crude device to avenge the killing in April of al Qaidas top two leaders in Iraq as well as to protest US interference in Muslim countries.         
	We are very lucky, mayor Michael Bloomberg said. We avoided what could have been a very deadly event.        
	Firefighters who arrived shortly after the first call heard a popping sound. I think the intent was to cause a significant ball of fire, Kelly said.        
	Most of Times Square, which lies about 6.5km from where terrorists attacked the World Trade Center, reopened just after 5am on Sunday with heavy police presence. Broadway officials said all shows did go on, though some began late.

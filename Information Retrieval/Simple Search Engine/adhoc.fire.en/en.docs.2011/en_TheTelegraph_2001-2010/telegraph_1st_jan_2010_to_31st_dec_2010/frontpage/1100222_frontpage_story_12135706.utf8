	Shilda, Feb. 21: Five CPM leaders compelled West Midnapore police to shift the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp from a well-protected plot to the vulnerable Shilda market, where policemen became sitting ducks during the Maoist attack, an investigation by The Telegraph suggests.        
	The CPM appears to have gone along with the five leaders to avert being wiped out in a handful of remaining strongholds in the area as several members, including the local committee secretary, linked their continuation in the party to the transfer of the camp.        
	Served such an ultimatum by a group that feared trial and eventual death in Maoist kangaroo courts, the party forced the police to let political compulsions override security red flags and herded the policemen into a suicidal location, according to the picture that emerges from piecing together information collected from the ground.        
	The camp was shifted from a more or less deserted place to almost the doorstep of the Shilda CPM office in the middle of a bustling market (see graphic). As many as 24 policemen died in the Maoist attack last Monday.        
	The main architects behind the shift were Udhhab Mahato, the secretary of the CPM local committee, and four other local committee members  Ananta Mukherjee, Gurupada Nandi, Dibakar Hansda and Tapan Deswali  according to CPM sources.        
	All these influential men live in and around the town and the group is considered the anchor of the party in a Maoist hotbed like Shilda. They wanted the camp shifted because they had already received death threats from the Maoists who levelled charges of corruption. Uddhab Mahato was not even ready to work as the local committee secretary after his predecessor was killed by the Maoists in 2006, unless the EFR camp was shifted near the party office, a CPM leader said.         
	The camp was shifted in 2007. Earlier, the camp was on a sprawling plot, 2km from the present site, and was surrounded by a boundary wall. The plot belongs to the irrigation department.        
	The location of the EFR camp is now at the centre of a controversy with the forces special IG announcing in public that he had repeatedly warned state police against the site that hampered the ability to retaliate for fear of civilian casualties.         
	The old site had five single-storey buildings where the EFR personnel stayed. There was vast open space around the cluster of buildings from where it was easier for the EFR personnel to spot any intruder from at least a kilometre away. Shifting the camp from concrete buildings to tents in the middle of a marketplace was suicidal, said a senior police officer.        
	Ananta, one of the CPM local committee members, refused to either deny or confirm if he had lobbied for the transfer, standing in front of his home with a police bodyguard who has a revolver tucked in his waist. You ask our district-level leaders. I cannot comment, he told The Telegraph, asked why the party got the camp shifted.        
	Ever since the attack on the camp, the CPM party office closes after 2pm. Asked why the party office was shut even though it was only 4pm, Mukherjee said he did not know. I will not go to the party office today, he added.        
	Ananta is close to a CPM zonal committee secretary who knows Dipak Sarkar, the West Midnapore district secretary. Sarkar was recently promoted to the state secretariat of the CPM for helping the party stave off the Opposition onslaught in his area during the Lok Sabha polls and for putting up resistance to the Maoists.        
	Local CPM sources said they had told district-level leaders that if the camp was not shifted to the marketplace, it would be difficult for the party to survive in Shilda. We told our district leaders to shift the camp to the marketplace. We told them if this was not done, our party members would be wiped out from Shilda, said a local committee member.        
	The district CPM leadership wanted Shilda to be protected because it has one of the three CPM-dominated gram panchayats in Binpur-II block. Of the 10 such gram panchayats in the block, seven are run by the Jharkhand Party. Shilda means a lot to us. If we are wiped out from here, the Jharkhand Party will step in, a CPM leader said.        
	The fear of the kangaroo courts also preyed on the minds of the CPM leaders, fuelled by the daylight murder of Shilda local committee secretary Anil Mahato and his bodyguard Dinesh Baskey by the Maoists in 2006.         
	 Mahato was travelling in a bus with his personal security guard while returning home from the party office. The attackers boarded the bus, dragged them out and shot them dead. Before leaving, they took away Baskeys AK-47, a local committee member said.         
	CPM district secretariat member Dahareswar Sen denied that the party had forced the camp to shift.         
	Earlier, the camp was on the irrigation department land where there were offices as well as employees quarters. The employees staying in the quarters had objected to the camp. On the other hand, the people of Shilda wanted the camp in the marketplace, Sen said.

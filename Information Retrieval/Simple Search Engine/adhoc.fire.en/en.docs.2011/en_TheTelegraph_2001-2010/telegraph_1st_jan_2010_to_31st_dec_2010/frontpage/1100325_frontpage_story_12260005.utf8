	New Delhi, March 24: Cops today marched in on a venue dressed for couture.         
	The Wills Lifestyle Fashion Week came to a stop even before it could start as policemen sought permits from the organisers that they did not have.         
	The Fashion Design Council of India had allegedly failed to obtain a no-objection certificate from the citys fire department for the five-day event at the NSIC (National Small Industries Corporation) grounds in the Okhla Industrial Area.         
	They hadnt taken the appropriate permissions for fire safety, so we stopped the show, a police officer said. There is a no show till the papers are in place. Its mandatory for a fire brigade to be parked at the venue to prevent any unforeseen incident, he added.        
	What had initially looked like a fashionably late start turned serious when the days show was scrapped. Todays event is cancelled and we will accommodate the events in the next few days. I agree we should have been better prepared for it. We have completed the things according to the norms now, fire laws are very strict and they should be, council president Sunil Sethi was quoted as saying by PTI.        
	We had reserved three more days for the event and even if we have to extend it for a day well do it for our buyers, he added.         
	A fire engine was seen parked at the venue later in the day. However, uncertainty loomed over the event scheduled to showcase nearly 130 designers, including newcomers and old hands like J.J. Vallya and Ritu Beri.         
	Designer Nida Mahmood, whose show was to have kicked off the event, told PTI: Im really sad.        
	What has happened is very unfortunate. The government should have supported us, designer Ranna Gill, who was to present her collection tonight with Bollywood star Minissha Lamba as her showstopper, was quoted as saying.         
	Another designer, Pallavi Mohan, who is scheduled to showcase her label Not So Serious on the second day of the fashion week, complained that it was really upsetting and hard for designers in such situations because of the emotional drainage.

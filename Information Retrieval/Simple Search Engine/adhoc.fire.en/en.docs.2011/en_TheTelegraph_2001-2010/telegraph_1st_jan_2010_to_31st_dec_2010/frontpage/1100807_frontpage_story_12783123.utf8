The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Parties slip on sealing border 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Parties slip on sealing border 
          BIJOY KUMAR SHARMA                                                The copy of Badruddin Ajmals letter. Telegraph picture      
	Dhubri, Aug. 6: There has been much hue and cry in Assam for years over the need to seal the Indo-Bangladesh border to stop infiltration but not a single party has ever sent a proposal to the Union home ministry in this regard.        
	This came to light in a written reply furnished by the Union minister of state for home, Mullapalli Ramchandran, to questions submitted by Dhubri MP Badruddin Ajmal in the ongoing parliamentary session.        
	One of Ajmals four questions (earmarked ga in Hindi, equivalent sequentially to the letter C in English alphabet) was whether the home ministry had ever received any proposal from any political party on sealing the Indo-Bangladesh border.        
	Ramachandran replied, Bharat-Bangladesh sima ko seal karne ka aisa koi prastav rajnaitik partion se prapt nahi hua hai (no such proposal to seal the Indo-Bangladesh border has been received from any political party).         
	Expressing surprise, Ajmal told The Telegraph over phone, How can it be that no political party ever thought of moving the ministry when almost all of them as well as several organisations have been making a hue and cry over infiltration from Bangladesh and have termed it a big problem? This is unbelievable.         
	But how can one deny the reply given by the ministry which looks after border affairs and this undeniable fact shows that no political party is seriously concerned about sealing the Indo-Bangladesh border, he added.        
	AGP spokesperson Apurba Kumar Bhattacharjee said the question of submitting a proposal to the home ministry on sealing the border did not arise as the issue was emphatically incorporated in the Assam Accord signed in 1985.         
	Moreover, we have been submitting memoranda to the ministry since the signing of the Assam Accord to implement the clause dealing with barbed wire fencing and sealing the border. It was our proposal to seal the border so that not a single Bangladeshi could infiltrate into Indian territory through Assam, he added.        
	State BJP sources said the party, led by Uma Bharati, had first formed a human chain in 1994 at Satrasal along the Indo-Bangladesh border to demand sealing of the border. Fifteen years later, the All Assam Students Union, led by its adviser Samujjal Bhattacharrya, formed a human chain at Sonahat in Dhubri district on November 10, 2009.        
	State BJP president Ranjit Dutta said the party had been sending proposals to the ministry to seal the border to check infiltration and transborder smuggling.         
	We had planned a massive programme on sealing the border to stop infiltration and transborder smuggling. It was to start from Dhubri on July 31 but the district administration did not allow us to organise it because of law and order problems, he said, adding that the party would go ahead with the programme after August 15.

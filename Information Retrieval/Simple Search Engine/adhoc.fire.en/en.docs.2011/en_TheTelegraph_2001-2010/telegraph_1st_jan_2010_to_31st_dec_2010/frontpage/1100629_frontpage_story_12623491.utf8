          OUR BUREAU                                               
	Jamshedpur, June 28: In an unprecedented show of rage, an angry mob of contract workers pelted stones and set fire to cars at one of the entrances to the Tata Steel factory after one of them had a dispute with security personnel early this morning, shattering the calm the industry hub has always been known for.        
	The needle of suspicion pointed to a JMM-backed contract workers association for the nearly two-hour mob frenzy that left nine persons injured and as many as six cars and over a dozen two-wheelers parked inside the premises charred.        
	The police had to fire 18 rounds in the air and call for reinforcements when the violence threatened to spill out of control.        
	Company officials maintained it was a minor dispute regarding the entry of a worker that blew out of proportion. But, senior employees and longtime steel city residents suspected that the violence was pre-planned and that the gate row may have been used as a trigger by a section of disgruntled contract labourers negotiating a pay raise with the company under the aegis of Jharkhand Mazdoor Morcha, a JMM-backed labour organisation.        
	The police, however, claimed they had no evidence as yet to bolster this theory.        
	JMM MLA from Seraikela Champai Soren, who is leading the negotiations on pay with Tata Steel and even met MD H.M. Nerurkar in this afternoon, admitted some of the Morcha members were unhappy with the companys attitude.        
	When SAIL can increase wages of contract workers, why not Tata Steel, he said, but denied the Morcha was involved in todays violence.        
	Tata Steel officials maintained the incident occurred around 7.45 am after security personnel stopped a person trying to enter the premises without clearing the mandatory security requirements _ a green light from the recently installed Radio Frequency Identification Device once an ID card is inserted.        
	Company spokesperson Prabhat Sharma said, The securitymen on duty noted that a few contract labourers were attempting unauthorised entry into the works during a routine checking exercise at the L-Town Gate. On confronting them, a minor altercation took place which flared up in sometime.         
	The police have detained a few labourers for interrogation. SSP Navin Kumar Singh claimed it was only around 9.30am when a semblance of normality was restored. But contingents of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Jharkhand Armed Police (JAP) had been stationed inside the premises as a precautionary measure.         
	Investigations are on and we will make arrests accordingly, he added.        
	There are six entry gates to the Tata Steel factory premises. Contract workers, numbering over 10,000, enter from three  L-Town Gate, Power House Gate (Jugsalai) and Burmamines Gate.         
	According to eyewitnesses, around 7.45 am, a security guard stopped a worker who went past the gate even though his ID did not flash a green light from the RFID. The guard then slapped him. The worker retaliated and a scuffle ensued with over 2,000 other workers waiting in queue behind them.        
	In no time, more workers joined in the fight. The police reached the spot 20 minutes later by which time the workers had begun hurling stones and anything else they could lay their hands on.         
	In the free for all, the L-Town Gate turned into a battlefield. Several cars, mortorbikes and cycles inside the premises were targeted and torched. Among them were two police jeeps.         
	A group of workers also barged into the security room and damaged a computer unit after shattering the window panes. By then, the police began firing in the air to disperse the crowd and called in additional forces, including RAF, as the violence threatened to spin out of control.         
	The mob had already torched six four-wheelers, including the two police vehicles, by the time I reached the spot. Several more vehicles would have been torched if we had not acted, Singh said.        
	Among those injured were seven contract workers, who havent been identified yet. The three company security personnel injured were manager N.K. Pegu and security guards Kalavati Pandey and Samresh Singh.        
	The injured have been admitted to Tata Main Hospital.         
	The SSP said that a case pertaining to the torching of police jeeps would be lodged with the Sakchi police station, while cases related to the violence within the company premises would be registered at the Bistupur police station.        
	Deputy commissioner R.K. Agarwal, sub-divisional officer (Dhalbhum) Kartik Kumar Prabhat and other senior officials remained anchored at the spot for hours, supervising special security measures that would be put in place for the night.

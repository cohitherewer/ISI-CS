          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Barack and Michelle Obama with students of Holy Name High School in Mumbai on Sunday. (AP)                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 7: Making his 10-minute presentation before the US President, the boy from Bhendi Bazaar never got tongue-tied for a moment.        
	That predicament of not knowing what to say came later. It came when Barack Obama, two-time Grammy winner for the Best Spoken Word Album, sought public-speaking tips from him.        
	He said, Excellent presentation; perhaps you could give me some tips on public speaking, Juzer Furniturewala, 15, told The Telegraph hours after his encounter with Obama at his Colaba school.        
	At first I thought he was joking, so I begged his pardon and asked him to repeat what he had said. Then I told him, You are very good yourself. It did not feel like I was speaking to the President of a country. He spoke like a friend.        
	Juzer, the head boy of the Holy Name High School, had met the Obamas as part of a band of 20, all handpicked from among the schools 2,000 pupils. The boy, whose family owns a hardware factory in central Mumbai, had bought a new uniform for the occasion.        
	The Obamas were treated to an environment project that Juzer and other Class X students had prepared for them. A chart that carried a sketch of the President dressed as Superman caught the US First Couples attention and evoked some banter.        
	We had also put up a black rock of papier mache, showing a crying face, and labelled it black burnt carbon earth, Juzer said.        
	Mr Obama said, You dont want to live on that! But I thought Its your country that has pushed us to live on such an earth. I did not tell him that, though, said one of Juzers classmates.        
	Obama later told the waiting media: A tree a day keeps global warming away, in case you missed it.        
	When a reporter asked how the Holy Name kids compared with the ones at Sidwell, the private school in Washington the Obamas daughters go to, he received a cold stare from Michelle.        
	But the President quickly saved the day with: Young people are much more aware and focused about environmental issues (compared to his own generation). I have noticed this with (the Obamas daughters) Malia and Sasha... and todays presentation as well.        
	US authorities had chosen the school for the visit because it offered an excellent security environment. It helped that the Holy Name community runs many Jesuit schools worldwide, and nowhere more than in the US.         
	Chicago, virtually the Obamas hometown, boasts one of Americas largest Holy Name churches: the Holy Name Cathedral.        
	The Obamas have been wooing the American Catholics for a long time, a top US consulate source said.        
	Sometime back, Michelle Obama made a public statement saying her husband carried a picture of Mother Mary in his wallet. The choice of Holy Name will obviously send a message back home.        
	Father Pinto, principal of the Colaba school, dismissed the insinuation. He put the choice of his school down to its brilliant academic results and pointed out: Only five per cent of our students are Christians.

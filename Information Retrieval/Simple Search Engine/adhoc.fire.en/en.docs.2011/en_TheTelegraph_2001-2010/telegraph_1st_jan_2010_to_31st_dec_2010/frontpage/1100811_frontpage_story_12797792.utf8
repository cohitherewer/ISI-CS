                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Farook tells CBI to probe illegal mining
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                               
	Ranchi, Aug. 10: Governor M..H. Farook has ordered a CBI probe into rampant illegal mining of iron ore in West Singhbhum and its transportation out of the state.        
	His principal secretary Sudhir Tripathy told The Telegraph that Raj Bhavan had approved the state home departments August 7 proposal to hand over the FIR lodged in this connection at Gua police station on May 6 to the CBI.         
	Several prominent individuals, including forest, mines, police and railway officials, local politicians and their aides are likely to face the music now.        
	The first whiff of a scam came sometime in March this year when the Haldia port authorities complained to then chief secretary Shiv Basant that fake challans (transit permits) were being used to transport iron ore from Jharkhand.        
	The state government, thereafter, sent a letter to the CBI, seeking the agencys help to crackdown on illegal mining and transportation.         
	Chaibasa sub-divisional officer (SDO) Ajit Shankar conducted a random survey of transportation and booking records of consignments sent by rail by various companies in January and February 2010.         
	Based on the findings, the SDO lodged an FIR on May 6 stating that five companies  Tirupati Balaji Enterprises Pvt. Ltd, Ma Tarini Minerals, SARA International, Devansh Export and Apical Exim  either did not possess licences issued by the district mining office or were using fake challans to transport minerals to various parts of the country.         
	On June 26, CBI special director A.P. Singh wrote to Basants successor, stating that the agency was willing to take over the probe.        
	According to Shankars FIR, the district mining office had not issued a trade licence to Tirupati Balaji, and the transit permits the company was using were issued to Rungta Mines.         
	The company was found to have booked iron ore consignments of 3760.057MT and 3680.58MT on January 14 and 3840.58MT and 3506MT on January 21 at Noamundi railway station.         
	Similarly, it had booked 3515.270MT for transportation on February 24.        
	The statement given to the railways by the company showed that the consignments were transported to the station on 95 vehicles, several of them registered as motorbikes, scooters and auto-rickshaws.                           
	Similarly, the FIR said Ma Tarini Minerals booked 2962.42MT on February 2. The company too did not have a licence. Out of 89 vehicles used for transportation by the company were nine motorbikes, four jeeps and five SUVs.         
	Devansh Export too had not been issued a licence for storage and mineral trade when the survey was conducted. The company, however, got an export licence and storage and trading licence on April 9, 2010. It had booked 3613.28MT on January 3, 2010.        
	The company claimed to have used 100 vehicles to transport minerals. Eight of them were motorbikes.        
	SARA International too had no licence, and was found exporting 3921.10MT on February 19. According to the FIR, the challans used by it had been issued to Apex Export.        
	Of the 87 vehicles used for transportation, 12 were motorbikes, 10 scooters, 11 SUVs and 12 auto-rickshaws.        
	Apical Exim was found exporting 3898MT after buying it from Monnet Ispat, which has a licence. However, the numbers of several trucks mentioned in the challan turned out to be those of bikes.        
	The challan is a transit permit issued by the mining office to transport ore outside the state. According to a rough estimate, around 700 trucks cross the Gitilipi checkpost daily. Sources said the minerals might have been transported by trucks, but since a truck is not allowed to carry more than 17 tonnes, the obvious overloading was adjusted by adding fictitious numbers of vehicles.         
	The trucks often carry 50 to 55 tonnes, the entire excess being illegal consignment.        
	The official figure, according to the district mining sources in West Singhbhum, for the total dispatch of iron ore was 230 lakh metric tonne in 2009-10 which yielded revenue of Rs 170 crore. According to a rough estimate, the business of illegal mining was to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore every year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Oh, Sush! Tweet and repent
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Oh, Sush! Tweet and repent
  - Scalded leader joins league of tech-jinxed politicians           RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                             Sushma, Suhel                                       
	New Delhi, Dec.1: She says it was the desire to connect that prompted her to be bitten by the Twitter bug. She might have cause to say she got bitten hard.        
	When Sushma Swaraj became the nations highest ranking politico, as leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, to join the Twitter club last week, she got a rather nasty welcome  a barb on Bellary brothers by Suhel Seth, The Telegraph columnist, consultant and busybee at large.         
	One of the first followers of her publicised debut on twitter, Seth also noted in a typically ascerbic post: Can someone like Sushma Swaraj be on twitter because twitter has IQ barriers?         
	Sushma had contested unsuccessfully against Sonia Gandhi from Bellary, the Karnataka seat that is in the news now because of the alleged misdeeds of the Reddy siblings, the mining barons who are also BJP leaders.        
	The tweet disappeared mysteriously from Seths site and but for one fleeting appearance on google.com was untraceable later.        
	Partha Sarathi, a follower of Seth, endorsed the jab, saying, U r right. SS doesnt have IQ. If she had, she would have lobbied for Sunil Mittal. She is (an) idiot. Ha, welcome to online mobocracy, Sushma, everyones on a level playing field, no points for being higher in the hierarchy.         
	The strait-laced former BJP spokesperson, who is supposed to shun gossip and always says everything on record, including her connections with the Bellary brothers, might yet find the chirp-chirp caboodle of twitteratis a little too testing.        
	Although she has resisted the temptation to indulge in repartee so far, the medium has a way of drawing you into indiscretions. Such as Shashi Tharoor committed at his own expense.        
	Instead, she has been typically officious and used the domain to put out things known to people for months. Like her recorded dissent on the CVCs appointment. There was no startling insight into her politics or personality.                          
	In the tangled web of the BJPs internal politics, more than one person was said to have promptly told Sushma that someone in the party had instigated the Seth jibe. Sushma wasnt available for a response. Neither was there one on her twitter site. But sources said she was indeed upset.         
	Seth justified himself: I dont want Sushma to give me a daily report about why shes boycotting Parliament. Twitters a mechanism of opinion, of connecting with the young. And not about engaging with 80-year olds in the RSS.         
	Those who have known Sushma for years expected nothing more than quotidian details that read like jottings from her business notebook. Her first tweet was an index of her circumspection. Prefaced with a self-introduction, it said, We hope to keep in touch on twitter.         
	Some in the BJP did emulate Seths advice of using Twitter in a humorous way and to effect. Like Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, an acknowledged wiz with technology and words. A couple of days after the NDAs Bihar win, he tweeted: My heartily (sic) congratulations to party members of BJP and Janata Dal (United) and extended congrats to Nitish Kumar and Sushil Modi.         
	Apparently nettled by Nitishs ban order on him in Bihar, Modi let it be known that the victory was a joint endeavour and that the kudos ought to be equally shared by him and his BJP surname sake.        
	Tharoor, whose twitters claimed his job, seemed to have learnt a lesson or two if his recent posts were an index. For instance, Tharoor, who never tires of proclaiming his and Indias secular standing, refused to say a single word on the Ayodhya judgment because my family has nothing to do with that place.        
	So how do politicos look at social networking stations? Twitters as good or as bad as driving a car. I dont do it for help or harm but fun, said Congress MP and spokesperson Manish Tewari.        
	He contested Seths view of youth connectivity, saying: Most people on twitter are middle-aged. The young are on Facebook.         
	NCP MP Supriya Sule, 41, dismissed them. I am not impelled to visit any of them because I work at the grassroots. Ditto for Congress MP Meenakshi Natrajan, part of Rahul Gandhis core team. I dont know anything about them, I dont use them.         
	Akhilesh Yadav, the young legatee of Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party, whos on Facebook, sounded more enthused than this peers. Its new technology and it is useful to network. It can be used for good and bad things depending on the user.         
	Sushma has joined the growing ranks of the BJPs twitterers who include party president Nitin Gadkari. His lone tweet posted in September 2009 -- three months before he took over the party--is as sanitised as Sushmas.         
	Does M. Venkaiah Naidus counsel to Tharoor resonate in the background for both? The BJP leader had warned: What is this tweeting? Too much tweeting will lead to quitting.

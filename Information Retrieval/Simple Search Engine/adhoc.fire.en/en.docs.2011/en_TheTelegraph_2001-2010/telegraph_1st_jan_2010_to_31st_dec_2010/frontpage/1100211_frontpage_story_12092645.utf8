          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Kokrajhar, Feb. 10: The Centre today promised to send in additional forces to restore order in the violence-scarred Bodoland Territorial Areas District.         
	Union home secretary G.K. Pillai, who was here to attend the 8th Bodoland Day celebrations at Bodofa Nwgwr, said he was deeply concerned over the clashes in the Bodo belt.         
	We are concerned over the killings which are taking place. It is a huge loss of innocent lives. I think all of us must put our heads toge ther to try and improve the law and order situation in this area, he said in his speech at a public meeting after the inauguration of the BTC secretariat and Assembly buildings.         
	In Bodo language, Pillai said: Today, on this day, those who have taken the path of violence and killing, I appeal to them to stop the killings. Dont kill your brothers and sisters. For the future, we need to provide a clean environment of peace and unity and a sense of security to our younger generation.         
	He later told reporters that apart from deployment of additional forces, all efforts would be made to seize illegal weapons.         
	Pillai also promised that the unfulfilled clauses of the Bodo accord, signed in 1993, would be implemented.         
	The chief of BTC Hagrama Mohilary, on the other hand, urged the Centre for direct funding to the BTC.         
	The funds, if directly made available to the BTC, besides creation of provisions for separate budget for Bodoland, would help in accelerating the development, he said.         
	Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who attended the programme as the chief guest and inaugurated the Assembly building, termed the Bodo accord the greatest risk in his political career.         
	The chief minister also urged Ulfa and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland to come forward for negotiations.         
	Pillais assurance of improved law and order came on a day when three militants of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (Daimary) were gunned down during an operation in an Udalguri reserve forest.         
	The operation came a day after four explosives experts of the Ranjan Daimary faction were arrested in Dhemaji.        
	Defence spokesman Col R. Kalia said a joint team of 3 Assam Rifles and police launched the operation in the Jingabil area, around 9km north of Mazbat police station, last night.         
	This morning, the securitymen were fired upon by a group of five militants, who were taking shelter in a temporary hideout in Rowta reserve forest.         
	An AK-47, two pistols, ammunition and receipts of extortion money signed by finance secretary of the NDFB, E. Rifikhang, were found on the slain militants.               
	The Udalguri superintendent of police, A.K. Tiwari, said security forces had information about a group of five militants taking shelter in a makeshift camp in the area last night.         
	Although the slain militants are yet to be identified, the recovery of assorted weapons and receipts signed by Rifikhang suggest that they are directly connected to the leadership, the official said.         
	Rowta reserve forest, bordering Arunachal Pradesh, has turned into a favourite hideout for NDFB militants.         
	In the past 20 days, six cadres of the NDFB were killed in encounters with security forces in the reserve forest, he said.

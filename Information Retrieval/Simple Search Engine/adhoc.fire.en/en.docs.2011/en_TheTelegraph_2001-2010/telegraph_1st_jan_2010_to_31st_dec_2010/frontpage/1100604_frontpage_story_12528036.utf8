          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           Lieberman      
	New Delhi, June 3: Israel has regretted bracketing India with other violence-hit countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Thailand by its foreign minister at the UN.         
	In a conversation with UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday, foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, had accused the international community of hypocrisy and double standards in criticising Tel Avivs attack on an aid flotilla for Palestinians.        
	Lieberman dubbed the raid an unmistakably defensive action and said the international community had remained silent and passive when in the past month alone 500 people were killed in various incidents in Thailand, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and India.         
	In a meeting on Tuesday, UN Security Council members had condemned the attack, in which 10 pro-Palestinian activists were killed, and urged Israel to end its blockade of the Gaza Strip. India had deplored the Israeli action.        
	Yesterday, the Israeli embassy in New Delhi went into damage-control mode over Liebermans remarks. It said: It was a regrettable error.        
	Israels ambassador to India, Mark Sofer, said his country doesnt see India in the same light as it sees its enemies. India is a close friend for whom we have the greatest respect, Sofer said, adding that his country listens to everything India has to say on West Asia.         
	The Israeli foreign office has also amended the ministers speech, deleting India from the list of violence-hit countries Lieberman mentioned.        
	We are taking this up to make sure any misunderstanding arising out of an error of this nature will no longer be there, Sofer said.         
	He backed up that statement by saying Israel stands hook, line and sinker behind India in its struggle in south Asia, a statement seen as an allusion to the fight against terrorism.

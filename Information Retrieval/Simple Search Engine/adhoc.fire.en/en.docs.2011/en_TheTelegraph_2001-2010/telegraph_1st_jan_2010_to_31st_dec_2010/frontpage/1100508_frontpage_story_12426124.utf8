The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Census to ask for caste label
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Census to ask for caste label
  - Centre accepts Opposition demand        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, May 7: Caste will be included in the ongoing census after nearly 80 years, though a formal announcement has yet to be made.        
	Sources said the government had given a discreet indication about conceding the Opposition demand, which was supported by many in the ruling Congress.        
	The cabinet will now finalise the decision and work out the modalities for the historic step. Eight censuses have taken place since 1931, seven of them in independent India, but not a single one of them has covered caste.        
	Cabinet ministers and senior leaders revealed in off-the-record conversations that listing of caste would be done in the ongoing census but analysis of the data would have to wait.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in Parliament: The home minister has made a detailed statement on census. I am aware of the views of the members of Parliament belonging to all sections. I assure you that the cabinet will take a decision shortly.         
	Opposition MPs had failed to take the hint from the home ministers reply to yesterdays Lok Sabha debate on including caste in the census and created a ruckus.        
	Palaniappan Chidambaram had been misunderstood as he had listed the difficulties in including caste. But he had also said: A number of arguments and reasons have been given in favour of caste. They will be a valuable guide to the government.         
	As the House assembled at 2.30pm after the break, the Prime Ministers guarded statement mollified agitated members. They were also told about the governments plan at a meeting called by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	The cabinet had taken up the matter a few days back and decided to continue discussions in the backdrop of the reluctance of a section of the Congress leadership to succumb to Opposition pressure when the census had already begun.        
	Although a cabinet decision is awaited, the Opposition was today celebrating a battle won and burst into an unusual chorus to hail the government.         
	Leaders of different parties praised Manmohan Singh and the leader of the Lok Sabha, Mukherjee. The effusive response left no doubt about the impending cabinet decision.         
	If Samajwadi leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and RJD counterpart Lalu Prasad expressed deep faith in the Prime Minister, their rival and JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav saluted Singh for a large-hearted approach. Even BJP leader Gopinath Munde was generous in applause.         
	When Sonia Gandhi entered the House, Lalu and Mulayam intervened to say credit should be given to Soniaji too.        
	Sonia shook her head and pointed to Mukherjee, indicating where credit was due. Other government sources too revealed that it was Mukherjee who had convinced Sonia.        
	Several times in the law courts the government has had to explain its position on caste-based reservation by clarifying that it does not have contemporary data and depends on the information collected in the British-held census of 1931.        
	Even after the announcement of the 27 per cent reservation for the Other Backward Classes during the tenure of UPA I, the government had to concede in court the absence of recent data.

                          Indian-American astronaut Sunita Williams                    
	Washington, July 10 (PTI): Indian American astronaut Sunita Williams will travel to space for the second time in June 2012, US space agency Nasa announced today.        
	Born to Gujarati parents in Euclid, Ohio, Williams, 44, holds the record for the longest space flight by a woman: 195 days.        
	Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide will join her on a Soyuz 31 flight to the International Space Station in 2012.        
	The announcement was made by Nasa and its international partners, Russian Federal Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration.        
	Nasa said Williams would become the commander of the International Space Station in October 2012.        
	Selected by Nasa on June 1998, Williams had served as a flight engineer aboard the International Space Station. She was launched with the crew of STS-116 on December 9, 2006, docking with the station on December 11, 2006.        
	As a member of the Expedition-14 crew, Williams had established a world record for women with four spacewalks totalling 29 hours and 17 minutes of extra-vehicular activity. During her stint in space, she broke the record of Shannon Lucid.        
	Williams returned to Earth and landed at Edwards Air Force Base in June 2007.        
	Astronaut Peggy Whitson broke Williamss record in 2008 with five spacewalks.

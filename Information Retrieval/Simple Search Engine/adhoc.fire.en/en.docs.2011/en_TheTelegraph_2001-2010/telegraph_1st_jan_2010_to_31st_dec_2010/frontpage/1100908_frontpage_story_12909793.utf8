          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA AMIT GUPTA                             BJP leaders Raghubar Das and Arjun Munda flank Governor MOH Farook (fourth from left) at Raj Bhavan while staking claim to form a new government in the state on Tuesday.

	Ranchi, Sept. 7: A wily Arjun Munda managed to extract unconditional support from the JMM and stake claim to form a government in Jharkhand today, three months after Shibu Sorens flip-flop prompted the BJP to pull down his government and put the state under Presidents rule.        
	Munda, accompanied by MLAs and leaders from the JMM, Ajsu and JD(U), met Governor M..H. Farook this afternoon and submitted a list of 45 legislators who, he claimed, supported his latest initiative.         
	The list included names of 18 MLAs each from the BJP and the JMM, two from JD(U), five from Ajsu and two Independents  Chamra Linda and Videsh Singh (see chart).         
	Munda even ensured the presence of 44 MLAs at Raj Bhavan today, except JMM MLA Paulus Surin, who is lodged in Chaibasa jail. Among the heavyweights who joined them were Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto, JMMs Dumka MLA and Gurujis son Hemant Soren and BJPs Raghubar Das.        
	By the evening, governor Farook was understood to have sent a report to the Union home ministry recommending that Presidents rule be revoked in the state.         
	The Union cabinet is likely to take a decision tomorrow.        
	The governor will extend an invitation to Munda only after Presidents rule is revoked, said a Raj Bhavan official.         
	If it was Sorens insistence on retaining the chief ministers chair that led to his downfall on May 24, this time, Guruji played the role of a father figure, blessing the new dispensation by choosing to stay away from the race for the top post.         
	Today, all MLAs supporting Munda assembled at Sorens Morabadi residence at 12.30 pm when he garlanded the BJP general secretary and Jamshedpur MP, Mahto and even son Hemant, asking them to run the new government smoothly.        
	JMM legislature party leader Hemant said they had offered unconditional support to the BJP for the sake of the states development.         
	Soon after coming out Raj Bhavan, Munda said, We have full majority. The next government will be formed under the leadership of the BJP.         
	Although he said a power sharing formula was yet to be worked out it was fairly certain that Munda would be the next chief minister while the JMM and the Ajsu would have to be satisfied with ministerial berths based on their number of MLAs.        
	Earlier, BJP MLAs elected Munda the new legislature party leader after party president Nitin Gadkari called Das from Moscow, asking him to quit his post. Das, who was in Hazaribagh yesterday, rushed here and joined his partymen at Raj Bhavan.         
	Hemant and others tried to look confident even though the JMM would have to iron out internal differences. As before, Simon Marandi did not hide his displeasure.         
	If senior and experienced ones are not given space in the government, this government will also not survive. I oppose the government formation move, said the Littipara MLA.        
	Predictably, the Opposition was harsh. The Congress described the move to form a new government as an unholy and opportunistic alliance, while Left and other parties called for dissolution of the Assembly.        
	Ally JVM heaped scorn on the Congress. Credit goes to the Congress. Had it dissolved the Assembly, BJP-JMM would not have made a move to form a government, said JVM chief Babulal Marandi.

	Srinagar, Sept 20 (PTI): Seeking ways to defuse the three - month unrest at Kashmir Valley in India, an all-party delegation led by Indian Home Minister P Chidambaram commenced a series of meetings which will be also attended by PDP (Peoples Democratic Party) but without its chief Mehbooba Mufti while separatists are staying away.
    The 42-member team, which arrived here on a crucial two-day visit to assess the ground situation, was received by Jammu amp; Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, as curfew remained clamped in the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir.
    The death toll during violence and clashes in the last three months is now at 103.
    PDP's Mehbooba Mufti will not be meeting the delegation which will have interaction with the main opposition party's General Secretary Mohd Dilawar Meer, who will be accompanied by 14 party members.

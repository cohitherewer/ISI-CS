          SUJAN DUTTA                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: The Centre has decided to set up a separate agency to replace the army-led outfit that was tasked to build roads in Maoist-influenced areas.         
	The Centre has also asked the states to respond to a list of retired major generals circulated by the defence and home ministries who are to be appointed as military advisers to four unified command headquarters in Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar and Orissa.        
	The cabinet committee on security has cleared the proposal moved by the Union home ministry to create a special road-building outfit. The home ministry envisages an agency like the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) but with a public-private partnership model.         
	But, top home ministry sources said, despite major private infrastructure developers being sounded out, none of the companies were ready because of the risks to personnel and equipment.        
	Ironically, the BRO, which is headed by army engineers, was tasked with road-building in parts of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh because civilian agencies (of the private and the public sectors) were not up to the task.         
	About seven years back, the BRO set up a special task force under Project Hirak to build a 200km stretch of National Highway 16 (NH16) that passes from Maharashtras Gadchiroli district to Chhattisgarhs Dantewada and to Andhra Pradeshs Khammam and Warangal districts.        
	The Orissa government too wanted the BRO to move into its western districts to build roads. But the BRO complained repeatedly that its personnel did not have security.         
	In May this year, the BRO all but abandoned Project Hirak on the plea that it had re-ordered its priorities and was moving its equipment and personnel to more demanding zones along the border with China.         
	The new outfit that the home ministry proposes to create would be tasked with not only NH16 but also smaller roads in the Maoist-hit states.         
	Home ministry sources also said that the army and defence ministry had recommended names of retired major generals to be appointment to unified command headquarters in Maoist-hit states.         
	Home minister P. Chidambaram announced in July this year, after a meeting with chief ministers, that unified command headquarters would be set up in four states and each command would be headed by the states chief secretary.         
	It would have a major general as a member who would inspect and help formulate the battle plans in the counter-Maoist operations.         
	None of the states have responded to the recommendations circulated by the home ministry so far. Unified headquarters in Assam and Jammu and Kashmir include corps and army commanders.

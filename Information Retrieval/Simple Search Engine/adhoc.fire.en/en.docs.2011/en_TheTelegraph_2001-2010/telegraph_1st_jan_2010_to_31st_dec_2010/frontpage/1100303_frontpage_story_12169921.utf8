          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	New Delhi, March 2: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today announced that the fifth round of talks  this time at the political level  on the Gorkhaland demand would be held on March 18.        
	 The talks, the venue of which is yet to be decided, will be held between the Centre-constituted political committee and representatives of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, the outfit spearheading the Gorkhaland movement in the Darjeeling hills.         
	Chidambaram did not elaborate on the names of the committee members. Sources at the home ministry, however, said minister of state for home affairs Ajay Maken would head the four-member political committee. Other members of the panel include Trinamul Congress MP and minister of state for health, Dinesh Trivedi, and two ministers of the Bengal government. One of the Bengal ministers is Siliguri MLA Asok Bhattacharya of the CPM and another is from the RSP whose name has not been disclosed.         
	Union home secretary G.K. Pillai will also attend the meeting. Names of Morcha representatives who will interact with the committee could not be known.         
	In its meeting on February 22 in New Delhi, the cabinet committee on political affairs (CCPA) had asked the Union home ministry to constitute the political committee to take forward the talks with the Morcha.         
	There have been four rounds of tripartite talks at the bureaucratic level between the Centre, the Bengal government and the Morcha. In the last round of discussions held in Darjeeling on December 21, the Morcha had been vociferous about the demand for talks at the political level. The representatives of the state and the Centre had then told the party that its demand would be conveyed to the respective governments.        
	 However, a separate state of Gorkhaland is not an alternative that we are even looking at. All that can be conceded is more executive powers to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, or to a new body that replaces it, said a home ministry source.         
	At the February 22 CCPA meeting, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee had vehemently opposed a separate Gorkhaland state. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has also consistently expressed his views against a separate state, as have senior officials in the Union home ministry.        
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri has welcomed the announcement of the next round of talks. However, the Morcha is waiting for Bengal government to announce its political representatives for the talks before making any further comments.         
	The hill outfit had been demanding that the political-level talks be held at the highest level indicating that the Union home minister and the Bengal chief minister interact directly with them.         
	However, Morcha leaders today indicated that they were satisfied with the Centres choice for the political-level talks but refused to say much.        
	In Calcutta, Subesh Das, principal secretary to the Bengal chief minister, said: We will definitely take part in the tripartite talks. But since it will be at the political level, we are yet to decide on who will lead it. But state government officials will also be there.

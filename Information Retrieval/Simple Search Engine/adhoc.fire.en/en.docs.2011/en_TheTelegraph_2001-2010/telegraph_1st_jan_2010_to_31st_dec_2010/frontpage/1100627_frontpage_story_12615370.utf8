          K.P. NAYAR                                    
	Toronto, June 26: When a section of Indians in Canada protested, 331 innocent men, women and children died. When other Canadians protested this week against the G8 and G20 summits taking place here, a Canadian police officer went up to one of the leaders of the protests and protectively expressed concerns about her safety.        
	Perhaps that significant difference explains retired Supreme Court justice John Majors indictment a few days ago that in Canada, the next of kin of victims of the Air India bombing 25 years ago have been treated as adversaries, as if they had somehow brought this calamity upon themselves.        
	On Thursday, as leaders of the worlds top industrialised countries were assembling in a resort destination near here in Huntsville, Muskoka, protesters decided that the best way to breach the security perimeter around the lake-bound G8 summit venue was to organise a flotilla of small boats.        
	When these protest plans became known, there were worrying recollections of a catastrophe that befell relief ships which tried to break the Israeli bloackade of Gaza a few weeks ago, resulting in nine deaths and dozens of injuries.        
	After all, President Barack Obama was in the G8 summits red zone and so was Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Russian and US security are particularly paranoid about protecting their leaders and the Canadians are leaving nothing to chance either.        
	But what happened when Thursdays protest flotilla approached Huntsville, was a model for countries like India, where at least one citizen dies somewhere in the country almost every day because the state and dissidents cannot decently negotiate and agree on the terms of how to air a grievance or voice a protest.        
	With scores of deaths occurring with disturbing regularity as a result of the recent rise of Maoists, the problem has become more severe.        
	This weeks G8-bound flotilla was commanded by a woman, Maude Barlow, who is such a veteran of protest here that she is called Canadas best-known voice of dissent.        
	Her adversary protecting world leaders was Julian Fantino, the police commissioner of Ontario Province, whose tough ways -- by Canadian standards, of course -- have made him a name to be feared in crime syndicates.        
	The very idea of Barlow and Fantino challenging each other on the emblematically named Fairy Lake, which forms a backdrop for Huntsville, was fraught with danger.        
	But as the flotilla of tiny vessels neared a large police boat fitted with advanced security equipment and weaponry, Fantino, who was on board, instead of drawing his gun, leaned towards Barlow and expressed his concern that she was not wearing a life jacket on the water where anything could happen under the circumstances.        
	According to accounts of this confrontation, widely publicised in the local media, what followed was a polite and warm exchange about boating on lakes and protection of sailors.        
	Of course, the protesters had their say and Barlow declared that the two summits taking place here were illegitimate meetings by the elite, for the elite.        
	It all ended well when she handed over a letter of grievances meant for the G8 leaders to Fantino and sailed back to shore.        
	The Canadian authorities have set aside a designated area near Huntsville for protests, which even the police refer to in conversations as the Free Speech Zone, a designation that could be interpreted as an implicit acknowledgement of empathy for the principle of protest in a democracy.        
	But it was a clear sign of the striking absence of virulent and often violent protests that marked similar international gatherings in the past that a local newspaper today published a three-column picture of a lone protester in the Free Speech Zone: Tyler Spencer, not even two years old, with a placard demanding more cookies for kids.        
	But the police fear that there may be more protests today as the G8 leaders move to downtown Toronto to join Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other heads of state and government from developing countries for a G20 summit.        
	Already, compared to the calm and quiet in Huntsville, there were significantly more visible protests in downtown Toronto yesterday. One fringe group has warned that they are unsatisfied with peaceful demonstrations, vowing to provoke a confrontation with the police.        
	But a total of five arrests so far in connection with the protests was a far cry from the huge damage to property in Seattle during a world trade meeting more than decade ago and scores of arrests that have been a regular feature of World Bank meetings in Washington.        
	While other Canadians protest peacefully and with dignity, fears continue here that sections of Indo-Canadians could repeat the violence in their show of dissidence, taking advantage of Singhs presence here.        
	For that reason, the Prime Ministers plan to lay a wreath at a memorial for victims of the Air India bombing was repeatedly chopped and changed.        
	The Canadians were initially not in favour of exposing Singh to the risk of an emotionally charged ceremony in the open and the Special Protection Group which guards the Prime Minister concurred.        
	But after the report of a judicial inquiry and the Canadian Prime Ministers visit to the memorial this week to apologise for the lapses related to the plane bombing, it was strongly felt in New Delhi that Singh should lay a wreath notwithstanding any perceived security risks.

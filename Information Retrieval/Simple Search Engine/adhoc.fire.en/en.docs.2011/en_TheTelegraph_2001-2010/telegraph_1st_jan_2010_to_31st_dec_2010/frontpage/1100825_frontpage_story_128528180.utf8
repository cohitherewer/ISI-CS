	New Delhi, Aug 25 (PTI): Government today dropped a controversial amendment to a contentious clause on the liability of suppliers in case of accident in the civil nuclear damages bill, virtually adopting an amendment moved by the Opposition BJP in a bid to evolve a consensus on the measure.
    Moving the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damages Bill, 2010 in the Lok Sabha, Minister of State in the PMO Prithviraj Chavan, tabled an amendment to Clause 17(B) which now now does not not have the word "intent" with regard to suppliers or their employees in causing an accident in a nuclear plant.
    The rephrased amendment now now reads "the nuclear incident has resulted as a consequence of an act of supplier or his employee, which includes supply of equipment or material with patent or latent defects or sub-standard services.

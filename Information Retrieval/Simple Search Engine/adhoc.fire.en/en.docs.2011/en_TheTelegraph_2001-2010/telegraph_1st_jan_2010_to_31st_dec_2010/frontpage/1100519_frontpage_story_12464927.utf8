  - Magnitude of the star power of the past missing, says Amritraj          AMIT ROY                                                    
	Cannes, May 18: Twinkle, twinkle, but not much glitter.        
	Ash in a little black dress turned heads last night, but the dazzle of stars at Cannes may have dulled a bit.        
	As the worlds most important film festival entered its seventh day, one view emanating from the French Riviera city was that the magnitude of star power was more in the past.        
	This particular Cannes  there arent many stars of any calibre: its all rather basic, Ashok Amritraj, now one of Hollywoods most important producers, told The Telegraph.        
	The former tennis player was commenting on a report in The New York Times by its film critic Manohla Dargis that this year the festival will be working harder with fewer stars.        
	Amritraj echoed her somewhat: Overall, there isnt the magnitude of the star power of the past.        
	But Amritraj acknowledged that Cate Blanchett, who plays Maid Marion in Ridley Scotts Robin Hood, the film that opened the festival on May 12, was terrific and a wonderful actress.        
	Glamour is hard to define, he reflected, but in the days of (Frank) Sinatra and (Humphrey) Bogart, the calibre of the celebrity was so larger than life. Whether it was Ingrid Bergman or Cary Grant, it was a different world and time.        
	In her piece, also carried by the International Herald Tribune, Dargis wrote: The Cannes Film Festival works hard to maintain that lustre of glamour, most obviously with the premiere promenade, but also with multiple totems of a bygone era.                    Ashok Amritraj at Cannes		    
	Dargis drew attention to a self-evident truth: Celebrities, not surprisingly, are what draw the crowds and the interest of the international news media.        
	After Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett leave, about the biggest Hollywood stars in the competition will be Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.        
	Amritraj pins part of the blame on the medias obsession with celebrities.         
	Unfortunately, the media today suck up celebrities so much that you cant tell if they are walking out of a restaurant in New York or walking down a carpet in Cannes, he said.        
	The obsession was on display when Woody Allens You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger, featuring Indian actress Freida Pinto, was shown to the media. Its impolite to shove, a woman told a male critic as journalists queued to get in. My card is pink with a yellow spot, just like yours.        
	Amritraj said celebrities were not of the magnitude of what they used to be. There are a very few exceptions  I have worked with everyone among the big women stars: Sandy Bullock and Angelina Jolie and Kate Hudson. I also think of Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly.        
	They had a stardom to them that is not possible today  its because you see so much of Sandy. She is on the cover of every magazine. I also mean Julia Roberts. Perhaps the coverage was not so much (in the old days). When they (magazine stories) did come out, it was very special.        
	But Amritraj insisted it was Hollywood that still defined glamour, although there were beautiful women everywhere in the world, whether they were African American or Indian or Chinese or American.        
	If the producer thought Hollywood was still the dream factory of the world, Bollywood too has cast its spell on Cannes.        
	The Indian presence at the French city has been growing for the past 10 years, the glamour quotient enhanced when Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai attended the out of competition official screening of Devdas in 2002.        
	This year, however, Cannes authorities apparently turned down an offer of an official screening for the Hrithik Roshan and Barbara Mori-starrer Kites.        
	Aishwarya, who now comes to Cannes with her husband Abhishek, has been a regular on the red carpet for several years. The 1994 Miss World turned heads when she and Abhishek came to a party last night to promote their film Raavan.        
	She later wriggled out of her little black dress to slip into a spangly pink sari.        
	Indian glamour of a very different kind was represented by Mallika Sherawat, who has been promoting two of her Indo-American collaborations, Hisss and Love, Barack.        
	But there appeared to be something desperate about Mallikas attempts to attract attention in Cannes. She would have been better advised to have found a nightclub in Mumbai.

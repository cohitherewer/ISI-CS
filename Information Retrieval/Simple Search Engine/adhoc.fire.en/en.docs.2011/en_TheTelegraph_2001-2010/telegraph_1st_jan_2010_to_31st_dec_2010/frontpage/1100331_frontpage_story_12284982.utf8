          OUR CORRESPONDENT                             From left: Deb with Datta and Malakar. (Kundan Yolmo)                                  
	Siliguri, March 30: The Trinamul Congress and the Congress today decided to form the Siliguri Municipal Corporation together, ending the cold war and putting up a show of unity ahead of the civic polls to be held across the state in May.         
	Although mayor Gangotri Datta has offered to step down from her post, no decision on the new incumbent or the composition of the mayors-in-council were announced.         
	Leaders of both the parties said the decision to dissolve the current board and form a new one had been taken under instructions from the respective high commands to further firm up the bonding between the two outfits.        
	After the alliances victory in the SMC polls held in September, both Trinamul and the Congress had staked claim to the mayors chair. Ultimately, at the insistence of Mamatas rival and Raiganj MP Deepa Das Munshi, the Congress had formed the board with the backing of the Left that had been ousted from the civic body after 28 years. The Congresss Datta became the mayor.        
	Since then, the Trinamul had been sitting in the Opposition. Even yesterday, at the budget session, Trinamul had accused the Congress-led board of having a tacit understanding with the Left.         
	However, today, Datta said at the joint media conference: I will offer the mayors post to Trinamul if it is necessary for the sake of the alliance.         
	District Congress president Shankar Malakar said: We had a meeting with the Trinamul leadership today and reached a consensus that from now on the Trinamul Congress and Congress will run the board together. The board will no longer thrive on the outside support of the CPM.         
	The people of Siliguri have voted for us to see the alliance running the SMC. There had been some problems during the mayoral elections but we consider them to be a closed chapter, said Trinamul district president Gautam Deb.         
	In Calcutta, Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee said the development was a very good news.        
	It will further strengthen the ties between the two parties, Chatterjee said. This was just the thing that we needed to send out a signal of unity between the two parties before the coming municipal polls. This has taken place because of the initiative of our party leader Mamata Banerjee who said the past bitterness should be forgotten.         
	Deb said Datta would ask for Trinamuls support to pass the budget tomorrow. The Trinamul would then assure her of its support and the budget will be passed. A decision will then be taken on dissolving the current board and setting up a new one.         
	Nurul Islam, the CPM leader in the SMC and the former mayor, said: There was always an underlying understanding between the two parties and that was only made public today.

	New Delhi, April 30: Most Brazilians may not be aware that we in India also play football. But Maoists have ensured that at least some people in the land of the Samba know about Operation Green Hunt.         
	On April 19, Brazilian protesters besieged the Indian mission in Brasilia demanding that the armed action against CPI (Maoist) cadres by Indian paramilitary forces be stopped.         
	The protesters, all of them Brazilian nationals, numbered about 40 to 50, according to the Indian mission in Brasilia. Organised by a group called the League of Poor Peasants, the demonstrators carried banners that said Long live the heroic resistance of the adivasi people and Indian peasantry! and Down with Operation Green Hunt!         
	They submitted a memorandum of demands to Indias ambassador B.S. Prakash. Officials in Delhi confirmed that they had received a report on a peaceful demonstration that took place barely two days after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh left Brasilia. Singh was there to attend the summit of Bric nations Brazil, Russia, India and China.         
	In the home ministry, the protest has caused concern, but probably not surprise. The ministry is aware of the CPI(Maoist)s links with similar organisations in several countries.         
	The partys politburo member, Khobad Ghandy, who is now facing trial in Delhi, had disclosed during interrogation Maoist links with guerrilla groups in other parts of the world, particularly in the Philippines and Brazil.         
	Members of revolutionary and feminist outfits participated in the Brasilia protest. They demanded that the Indian government not only halt its operation against the Maoists but also mining activity in tribal areas.         
	Sources in the government dismissed the demonstration as an isolated incident. They, however, stressed the need for Indian missions abroad to put across the real face of the CPI(Maoist), which has indulged in wanton acts of terror on innocent civilians.         
	The protest was engineered by fringe elements in Brazil with little support and should not be given importance. They do not know about Maoists having bombed school buildings and running extortion rackets. Maoists are not interested in protecting tribal rights but overthrowing the state by violence, said an official.        
	The League of Poor Peasants, which calls itself a social movement struggling for land rights, had also faced a government crackdown  Operation Peace on the Countryside  that was launched in 2007 in northern Brazil.         
	This groups allegations against President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silvas administration  arrests under false charges and torture  are similar to those that Maoists frequently voice against the Indian government. They accuse state power of acting on behalf of landlords.        
	Lula, who has been ruling Brazil for nearly eight years, however, is credited with reducing the percentage of people living below the poverty line from 28.2 per cent in 2003 to 22.7 per cent in 2005.         
	He launched a populist programme called Bolsa Familia soon after taking office. If the national job guarantee programme helped the United Progressive Alliance retain power in last years Lok Sabha elections, Bolsa Familia is believed to have played a similar role for Lula. His popularity rating is higher now than what it was when he assumed power.        
	Visiting Indian politicians  commerce minister Anand Sharma, who was part of the Prime Ministers delegation, and before him M.A. Baby, Keralas education minister  have been fascinated by the success of the programme

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Jag ready with fastest electric car
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Jag ready with fastest electric car
          AMIT ROY                      The interior view of the Jaguar C-X75                          
	London, Oct. 1: Jaguar is set to unveil what is being hailed as the car of the future at the Paris Motor Show 2010  the fastest ever electric sports car capable of a top speed of 205 miles per hour.        
	The first images of the C-X75 concept car have just been released, along with the claim the vehicle, which is powered by jet engines, can travel 560 miles without being recharged through a plug, thereby comfortably beating the current industry peak of 100 miles.        
	In a lyrical statement, the company said: Jaguar has revealed a stunning range-extended electric supercar concept car. The C-X75 has been designed to celebrate 75 years of the marquee and provide a glimpse into the future of Jaguar and its commitment to producing beautiful, fast cars powered by sustainable means.        
	Journalists recalled that back at the Geneva Motor Show in 1961, Jaguar launched the E-type which, to this day, is considered a work of art and, for many, the most beautiful sports car ever designed for the ordinary motorist.        
	The C-X75 is some years from production but if and when it rolls off the line, it should become available in India at the same time as it is sold in the west. More sensibly, the C-X75 should be interpreted as Jaguars commitment to cleaner, greener technology.         
	Mike Driscoll, Jaguars managing director, said: The C-X75 is a tribute to the people who shaped the iconic Jaguars that are revered to this day. By making it an innovative test-bed for the technologies of tomorrow, it also ensures that our reputation for engineering excellence will continue for another 75 years and beyond.                  The exterior view of the Jaguar C-X75      
	Advanced design features such as a ground-breaking propulsion system and active aerodynamics allow for an elegantly simple fuselage section that remains stable at very high speeds, according to experts.        
	The gas turbines on the car need to be refuelled, meaning the car essentially uses hybrid technology. However, it is classed as an electric car because it is driven by electric motors and there is no petrol engine.        
	 The gas turbine technology from Bladon Jets, which is based in Shropshire, recharge the battery beyond its basic range and provides extra power to the four electric motors driving the wheels.        
	The C-X75 is finished in Jetstream Silver, its designers staying true to the long-held Jaguar design philosophy of natural, flowing lines and simple, elegant forms.        
	Ralf Speth, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, commented: The C-X75 demonstrates that Jaguar is still leading the field automotive design and technology. And will always continue to build beautiful, fast cars.        
	Following the success of Bladons co-operation with Jaguar, Tata, the Indian owner of the British car marquee, has agreed to acquire a 20 per cent stake in the group.        
	Paul Barrett, chairman of Bladon Jets, confirmed: This is a very exciting milestone for our company. Ian Callum, Jaguars design director, added: The C-X75 is everything a Jaguar should be. It possesses remarkable poise and grace yet at the same time has the excitement and potency of a true supercar. You could argue this is as close to a pure art form as a concept car can get and we believe it is a worthy homage to 75 years of iconic Jaguar design.        
	Almost as fascinating as the news of the new Jaguar are the exchanges on newspaper blogs among motoring enthusiasts.        
	Reader one: I love it: an uber fast, fantastic looking car that has a huge range and can run emission free when in the city. A true intercity car for the future: one size does not fit all, fellas, but something like this would suit me... if I had the money!        
	Reader two: This is ground breaking.  This is a massive contribution to Co2 reduction, and puts the UK at the forefront of innovation.        
	Reader 3: Unless, of course, the Indian owners of Jaguar decide to pull the plug on it and move it to India. Bit early for backslapping when the British are not actually in control of the project.        
	Reader 4: Youre a cynical chap. You keep making these comments about these nasty Indian owners... not British. Clearly a bit of history here? The car is British-designed with British gas turbines, for a company that makes all its cars in Britain.         
	Maybe the fact that the owners are Indian is something that we should be grateful about given that they stood by Jag while the s..t hit the fan last year?

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Ranchi, Jan. 12: Chief minister Shibu Soren finally allocated portfolios to his ministers after three days of wrangling with allies but managed to retain the home department without succumbing to the pressure tactics of the Ajsu.        
	Not known to be particularly friendly towards industry, the JMM nevertheless kept the industries department, apart from rural development and agriculture.        
	However, Soren rewarded his two deputies  Raghubar Das of BJP and Sudesh Mahto of Ajsu  with some important departments. While Das was allocated finance, commercial taxes and energy, Sudesh got roads, building and sports, art amp; culture. (See chart).         
	Interestingly, the contentious home department wasnt mentioned in Raj Bhavan notification, but it was understood that it would be with the chief minister.         
	According to sources, the tussle over the home portfoliowas resolved after the BJP began claiming it, citing numbers. But with Ajsu already in queue, Soren decided to keep it himself.        
	The home portfolio comprises police, CID, special branch and vigilance bureau that was investigating a number of corruption cases.         
	Ajsus C.P. Chaudhary managed two important portfolios  water resources and drinking water amp; sanitation. But party chief Mahto was clearly miffed at being denied home. He became incommunicado soon after the notification was issued. However, Chaudhary said the issue would settle soon. We will wholeheartedly shoulder the responsibilities given by the chief minister, he added.         
	JMM insiders argued that since Ajsu had already bagged five important portfolios, Mahto had no reason to sulk.

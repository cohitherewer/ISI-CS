The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Manas urges Dispur to evict stubborn settlers 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Manas urges Dispur to evict stubborn settlers 
  - Park worried that encroachers, by providing shelter to rebels, could turn it into a militant hub          PULLOCK DUTTA                                                Manas National Park       
	Guwahati, July 12: Manas National Park authorities have sent Dispur an SOS to evict the 900-odd Bodo families which have made the park their home since the nineties and allegedly shelter NDFB militants.        
	These families, park officials claim, are sympathisers of the NDFB. We have once witnessed the damage caused by militancy to the park. We are still in the process of recovering but if these encroachers are not evicted immediately, we fear there is potential for militants making the park a haven again, the park director, A. Swargiari, told The Telegraph today.         
	Located in the foothills of Bhutan, Manas had suffered during the peak of Bodo insurgency, taking a toll on the animal population.         
	The rebels had even captured the main tourist bungalow inside the park and converted it into their headquarters until the army was called in to flush them out in 1995.         
	Almost the entire rhino population of the national park, with a core area of 500 square km, was wiped out when poachers and militants overran parts of the park, prompting Unesco to downgrade its status to that of a World Heritage Site in Danger.         
	Official sources said 64 rhinos were killed in Manas between 1980 and 1995.         
	In 1989, 1990 and 1994, as militants made inroads into all three ranges of the park, two ranges  Panbari and Bhuyanpara  were completely destroyed. Bansbari was the only one to survive the onslaught.         
	Sources said these families, based in Panbari range of the park, had encroached on the national park in the early nineties, allegedly with the blessings of NDFB.         
	Several attempts have been made since then to evict these families but in vain.         
	The director said though the park authorities have managed to procure Rs 10 crore from the National Tiger Conservation Authority  Manas is under Project Tiger  as a rehabilitation package for the settlers last year, the encroachers were not ready to vacate the land.         
	The park authorities are not in a position to carry out the eviction drive as it would create a law and order situation. We have transferred the funds to the state government so that it takes necessary steps to evict these villagers, Swargiari said.         
	A senior official of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), under which jurisdiction Manas falls, said a survey is under way to ascertain the exact number of settlers.         
	As soon as the survey is competed, we will carry out the eviction drive and rehabilitate these families in a different locations accordingly, the official said, adding that a model village would be created for these people.         
	A police official at Baksa district said there was information of these families providing shelter to militants. We have no proof of these encroachers having direct link with militants but they do provide shelter to militants, the official said.

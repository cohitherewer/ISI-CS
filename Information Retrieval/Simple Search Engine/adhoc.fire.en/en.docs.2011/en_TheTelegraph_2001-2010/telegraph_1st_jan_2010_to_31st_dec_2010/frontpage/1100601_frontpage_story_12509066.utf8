                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Apple sells 2 million iPads in two months

	May 31: Apple has said it sold more than two million iPads in the first 60 days of sales of the video-playing tablet computer.        
	The iPad, which made its debut in the US on April 3, became available in countries including Japan, France and Canada on May 28. More countries will follow this year, the Cupertino, California-based company said.        
	Apple is working hard to build enough iPads for everyone, Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs said in the statement. Apple was forced to delay the international release of the $499 iPad after underestimating demand at home.        
	The company may sell as many as 8 million iPads this year, according to Royal Bank of Canada. Apple has popularised a category of computer between a smartphone and a laptop, prompting competitors such as Dell Inc. to promise similar devices.        
	The iPad will spur a six-fold increase in industrywide shipments of tablet computers to 398 million by 2014, Framingham, Massachusetts-based research firm IDC said this month. IPad shipments worldwide in that period will rise to 46 million from 7.6 million this year, it estimated.        
	Countries outside the US are likely to account for 43 per cent, or 3.5 million units, of iPad shipments this year, Mike Abramsky, an analyst at RBC in Toronto, wrote in a May 20 report. The US will probably be the biggest market with 4.7 million units, followed by France with 805,000 and the UK with 585,000, according to the report.        
	The iPad has a 9.7-inch touch-screen display that lets users read books and magazines, view videos, play games and surf the Internet.        
	Developers have created more than 5,000 new applications for the iPad, Apple said in its statement today. The iPad will also run almost all of the more than 200,000 apps on the App Store, including those created for the iPhone or iPod touch, it said.        
	Customers last week lined up outside Apple Stores in central London, Paris and Tokyo to buy iPads for the first time, some camping overnight.

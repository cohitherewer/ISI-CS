          A STAFF REPORTER                             Junior doctors at SSKM during the ceasework                                  
	Installation of CCTVs in emergency and key wards, crackdown on touts and recruitment of trained personnel to handle emergency patients.        
	The government on Wednesday decided on a slew of measures to step up security at five state-run teaching hospitals in the city.        
	The steps were finalised at a meeting at Writers Buildings attended by home secretary Samar Ghosh, police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, medical education director S.N. Banerjee and the superintendents of the five hospitals.        
	The move followed a ceasework  lifted on Tuesday evening  by junior doctors at SSKM, Calcutta Medical College, RG Kar and National Medical College. NRS was the only teaching hospital in the city where junior doctors did not join the strike, triggered by an assault on some of their colleagues at SSKM following the death of a patient last Saturday.        
	Director Banerjee said the footage of CCTVs, to be installed in the emergency and key wards of each hospital, would be monitored by police. An officer of the rank of additional commissioner will liaise between the police and the hospital staff.        
	On Thursday, divisional deputy superintendents of police will tour hospitals in their respective areas and assess the situation.        
	No vehicles other than those on hospital duty will be allowed to enter the campuses. The drivers will have to collect passes for a two-hour duration. The vehicles of doctors will have specific stickers, said Jawed Shamim, joint police commissioner, headquarters.        
	Medical representatives will be allowed to park their vehicles on the hospital premises only from 2pm to 4pm.        
	Retired assistant police commissioners will be recruited to keep an eye on the private guards of the hospitals. They will also coordinate with the police to identify touts and take action against them.        
	As part of the measures, the director of medical education said, all five hospitals would recruit trained personnel to handle emergency patients. Once they join, patients relatives need not enter the hospitals in large numbers during admission.        
	Sixteen such personnel will join work at SSKM and RG Kar on October 1, said Banerjee. We will upgrade the resuscitation units attached to the emergency department of each hospital. Trauma care centres will be set up at RG Kar and SSKM.

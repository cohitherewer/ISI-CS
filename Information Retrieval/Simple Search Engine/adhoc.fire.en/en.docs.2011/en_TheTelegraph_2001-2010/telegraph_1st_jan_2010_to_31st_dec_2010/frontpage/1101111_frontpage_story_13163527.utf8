The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | In rural polls, fancy gadgets find few takers
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                In rural polls, fancy gadgets find few takers
          SANTOSH K. KIRO                                          Candidates and their supporters throng Kanke block office to collect panchayat poll symbols on Wednesday.   Picture by Prashant Mitra        
	Ranchi, Nov. 10: When it comes to election symbols, lock and key beats the purse hollow.        
	Items of daily use are objects of preference for candidates in the fray for the forthcoming panchayat elections. So while lock and key, carrot, kite, ceiling fan, book, television, coconut and chair are much in demand, there are few takers for violin, harmonium, car, necktie, brush and purse.         
	I am praying that I get the lock and key, said candidate Erenius Tete, as he queued up at the Kanke circle officers office to receive his symbol. He is contesting for the post of mukhiya from Kanke West panchayat. The lock and key is easy to remember and easy to explain to the elderly and not-so-educated, Tete added, as several others who had queued up with him expressed a similar wish to be allotted that particular symbol.        
	The district and block offices of areas going to polls in the first phase remained chock a bloc today as candidates descended in droves to take their symbols.         
	The State Election Commission has issued 15 symbols for candidates contesting for the mukhiyas post, including ceiling fan, kite, chair and the lock and key. For candidates contesting for the post of panchayat samiti members, 15 other symbols have been released, including bus, torch, almirah and cup and saucer. Similarly, for candidates contesting the post of zilla parishad member, 10 symbols like carrot, coat, batsman and ring are available. For ward members, the 15 approved symbols include book, cot, gas oven, television, and coconut.         
	According to State Election Commission rules, candidates will be allotted symbols according to their serial number. Thus, the mukhiya aspirant whose name figures on top of the list of candidates will get the first on the list of 15 symbols, which in this case is the ceiling fan, and the pattern would be repeated.         
	In 1978, I had fought on the camel symbol and became mukhiya of Ormanjhi panchayat. This time, the majority of the symbols cannot be deciphered by rural voters, said Baleshwar Baitha, a candidate for the post of panchayat samiti member for Ormanjhi gram panchayat.        
	The most dreaded symbols seem to be gas oven, cylinder, violin, pressure cooker, frying pan, cake, envelop, camera, and harmonium. I have got gas oven as my election symbol. I do not know how to explain that to my voters while campaigning because many have not seen such a thing. I would have liked a book, said a dejected Kamruddin Ansari, contesting for the post of ward member from Katamkuli panchayat in Kanke block.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 25: Tritiya Prastuti Committee-I (TPC) chief Bharat Gonjhu was gunned down in a shootout between two rival groups near Chandwa railway crossing in Latehar late last night.        
	The bullet-riddled body of the dreaded rebel, who used to call the shots in Chandwa-Balumath-Latehar region and was wanted in more than half-a-dozen cases of murder, kidnapping, burglary and extortion, was recovered today.        
	The Tritiya Prastuti Committee-I chief might have been bumped off by members of Tritiya Prastuti Committee. The two factions parted ways a year ago, said Latehar superintendent of police Kuldeep Dwivedi.         
	He added that Gonjhu was wanted in a number of cases, including the murder of BJP leader Munna Gupta in Balumath and torching of vehicles belonging to the family members of former Latehar MLA Prakash Ram.         
	The shootout that started sometime after midnight sparked panic among officers of Chandwa police station, who along with paramilitary forces rushed to the spot, thinking it was a Maoist attack. Local resident Ravi Gonjhu, who was caught in the crossfire, sustained bullet injuries and was admitted to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences. The injured youth has denied any involvement with Tritiya Prastuti Committee.        
	We initially apprehended a Naxalite attack. But the sound of gunshots died down as we reached the spot. Later on combing the area we stumbled upon the body of Bharat Gonjhu, said Akhilesh Mandal, officer-in-charge of Chandwa police station.        
	Mandal added that Gonjhus face had been smashed with a boulder and his body bore gunshot injuries. The body has been sent for post-mortem to the government district hospital in Latehar.        
	Interestingly, Chandwa railway crossing, where the shootout took place, is barely 2km away from the police station. However, it is close to Balumath, a rebel stronghold.        
	Chandwa town has been in the news of late for two upcoming power projects  one by Abhijeet Group and the other by Essar Group. Police have lodged a FIR against unknown persons and started investigations. Gonjhu was a resident of Fulsu village in Balumath police station area of Latehar district.        
	The Tritiya Prastuti Committee is a breakaway faction of CPI(Maoist) and was formed in Jharkhand in 2002.

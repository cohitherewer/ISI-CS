	Ranchi, Nov. 19: Chief minister Arjun Munda today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  for the first time after assuming charge in September  and sought special favours for Jharkhand that has been grappling with frequent political upheavals.        
	Deputies Sudesh Mahto and Hemant Soren in tow, Munda sought the Prime Ministers intervention in increasing the number of IAS and IPS officers and sharing funds for six pending railway projects in the state on 50:50 basis. The existing formula burdens the state with 66.66 per cent of the total project cost.        
	The state is facing an acute crunch of IAS officers. It has 104, including 20 on central deputation, against the sanctioned cadre strength of 208. Similarly, there are around 108 IPS officers instead of 137.        
	Inviting Singh to visit the state after the Parliament session was over, Munda also sought approval for special funds to strengthen the Special Task Force (STF) raised to fight Maoists. He also urged the Prime Minister to declare the long-pending Subernarekha Multi-purpose Project as a national one.        
	Deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto told The Telegraph that the Prime Minister had assured them that he would visit the state. I am interested in the development of Jharkhand, Mahto quoted Singhs response to Mundas requests.        
	Earlier, the chief minister also met Union water resources minister Pawan Kumar Bansal and urged him to increase funds for an irrigation project to Rs 1,000 crore from the existing Rs 100 crore under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP).         
	Mahto, who also happens to be in charge of water resources in the state, said that it was injustice meted out to Jharkhand by the Centre to fix a cap of Rs 100 crore under AIBP while Orissa gets Rs 1,200 crore for a project.        
	Munda, on his part, said the state had sent a proposal worth Rs 700 crore for various minor irrigation schemes and sought Bansals approval.        
	Jharkhand has a total agricultural area of about 29.74 lakh. Six irrigation projects receiving assistance under AIBP are Gumani Barrage Project, Upper Sankh Project, Surangi Project, Sonua Project, Panchkhero Project and Kansjore Reservoir project.        
	The state government has also been pursuing the inclusion of Sukari Reservoir Scheme, Tajana Reservoir Scheme, Raisa Reservoir Scheme and Reconstruction of head works of Kanchi Weir Scheme under AIBP.

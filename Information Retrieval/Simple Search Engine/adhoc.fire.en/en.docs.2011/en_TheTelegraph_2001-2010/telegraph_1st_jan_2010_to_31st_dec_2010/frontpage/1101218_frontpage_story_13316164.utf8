The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | After 25 years, King signs off
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                After 25 years, King signs off
                                Larry King during his last show in Los Angeles. (AP)                            
	Los Angeles, Dec. 17: The man behind the microphone has hung up his suspenders.        
	After a quarter of a century (and more than 6,000 shows), CNNs Larry King Live ended its run last night.        
	Its not very often in my life that Ive been without words, King, clad in red suspenders and a red-and-white polka-dot tie, said at the close of his show. I never thought it would last this long or come to this.        
	A gathering spot for ambitious politicians and repentant celebrities for 25 years, the cable news networks showpiece in prime time bid adieu with a gaggle of guests, with King protege Ryan Seacrest serving as a veritable ringmaster. Bill Maher and Phil McGraw (Dr. Phil) joined Seacrest and King in the LA studio; others including President Obama, former President Clinton, Katie Couric, Donald Trump, Regis Philbin and Tony Bennett joined in via satellite.         
	At the start of the show, Maher cautioned against eulogising King: This is the end of a show, not the end of this man.        
	While some people have criticised the veteran hosts interview style over the course of his career as too lenient or lacking in preparation, last night he was king.        
	As he rested his chin on his hand, his trademark move, each guest lauded his impact on broadcast TV. Brian Williams, host of NBC Nightly News, noted how Kings show was Americas confessional. Veteran broadcaster Barbara Walters joked that his departure meant less competition for her. The Rev. Billy Graham, in a letter read by Seacrest, said Kings absence would be greatly missed in my evening routine.        
	Theres no denying Kings gift for gab: Hes done nearly 50,000 interviews in a broadcasting career that included a stint in radio prior to joining CNN.        
	But the tech-savvy 77-year-old host announced in late June, via Twitter, that he would end his nightly CNN gig. King is not abandoning the network completely; he will host specials on CNN.        
	His decision to sign off from his evening duties comes as the network has experienced a steep decline in the ratings this year. CNN for the year to date ranks in third place in prime time.                    LOS ANGELES TIMES

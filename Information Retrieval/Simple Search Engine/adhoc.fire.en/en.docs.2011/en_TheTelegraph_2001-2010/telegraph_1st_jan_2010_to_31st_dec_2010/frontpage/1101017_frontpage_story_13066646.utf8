The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Law board for verdict appeal
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Law board for verdict appeal
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Oct. 16: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board today decided that appealing the Ayodhya verdict in the Supreme Court was the best option available to the community, although the moderates argued for a negotiated settlement.        
	Eventually, the moderates, led by board chief Maulana Rabey Nadvi and vice-president Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, were left ruing the Centres failure to come forward with any concrete proposal after the September 30 high court verdict. This, they were forced to concede, had left the community with no choice but to approach the apex court.        
	Several of the 51-member boards younger members made passionate appeals for conciliation and dialogue. They argued that the community wanted to move on and that 2010 was not 1992.        
	A prominent Bihar cleric, Maulana Wali Rahmani, repeatedly suggested setting a 30-day deadline to the Centre to initiate talks with all concerned and try to work out a settlement, as suggested by the high court. But his plea failed to cut much ice.         
	The law boards legal experts  led by Abdul Raheem Qureshi, Yusuf Hatim Muchhala, Zafaryab Jilani and Qasim Rasool Illyas  overruled the moderates. The lawyers said the three-way division of the disputed land was a dangerous precedent and bad in law. They insisted that the Supreme Courts intervention was needed in the larger interests of the community and the country.        
	The moderates then argued that Muslims should not be the first to rush to the apex court, but the other side felt this was a minor matter. Had there been even a ray of hope, we would have waited till the end of the three-month period for moving an appeal, a law board official said.        
	However, there was little enthusiasm for a direct dialogue with the other side, as suggested by Ayodhya-based litigant Hashim Ansari, the oldest petitioner in the case.        
	So, the disappointment at the Centres conscious avoidance of a peacemakers role was acute and widespread. Some board members accused the Centre of an ostrich-like approach and said the Congress seemed keener to cover its flanks than to respond to the mood of the nation.        
	The mood of the nation was invoked repeatedly today in allusion to the calm and measured way both communities had reacted to the verdict.        
	There were sharp divisions also over whether the law board should itself approach the Supreme Court or let the litigant, the Sunni wakf board, pursue the matter. The issue was eventually left to the board chief.        
	The law board has never been a party to the Ayodhya suit. If it does become one in the apex court, the moderates feel, that will convey to Muslims across India a strong message that may be out of step with the mood prevailing within the community.

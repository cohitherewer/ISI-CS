The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Petitioner meets mahant
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Petitioner meets mahant
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                               
	Lucknow, Oct. 3: Mohammad Hashim Ansari, the oldest living petitioner in the Ayodhya title suit, today initiated a move to avoid an appeal in the Supreme Court against the three-way division of land, but Muslim leaders said a lot would depend on the stand of the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board and the Centre.         
	The 90-year-old Ayodhya resident met Mahant Gyan Das, who wields some influence over the Nirmohi Akhara, which has been awarded a third of the land, to try and settle the issue locally.         
	Yes, we met for an hour in the morning when Mohammad Hashim Ansari was generous enough to come down to Hanumangarhi and call on me, Das, who heads the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, told The Telegraph over phone from Ayodhya.         
	Nirmohi Akhara is a member of the Akhara Parishad, and its leaders share a good rapport with Gyan Das.         
	It is possible to make a good beginning, Das said. We agreed on one thing: there is no need to approach the Supreme Court.         
	Ansari, a petitioner for Babri Masjid along with the Sunni Central Waqf Board, sounded upbeat, too. I told you it is my mission to sort out this problem before my death. Meeting Gyan Das is part of my humble attempt to continue that effort. I am not doing it on my own. I have been asked by the Sunni Central Waqf Board to do so, he said.         
	The waqf board had earlier announced plans to appeal against the September 30 verdict of the Allahabad High Court, but it is under pressure from some of its members to settle the issue through dialogue. The board counsel, Zafaryab Gilani, today denied knowledge of Ansaris peace initiative.         
	Neither the Nirmohi Akhara nor Ram Lalla Virajman, the third petitioner which has control over the third of the land where the idols are now placed, can build a grand temple on just their 22 acres. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which has been close to the Ram Lalla Virajman trust in the past, is trying to convince it to appeal to the Supreme Court for control of the one-third share given to the waqf board to build a mosque.         
	We have complete trust in Ram Lalla Virajman and we will go by their stand, Ayodhyas VHP chief Sharad Sharma said. But asked about Ansaris peace initiative, he said Muslims should try to forge a consensus among members of the waqf board to donate to the Hindus the share of the land allotted to them by the high court.         
	Gyan Das and Ansari appear to be working on a plan to isolate the VHP from Ram Lalla Virajman and the rest of the petitioners which, sources said, may not be easy. The idea is that if the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla Virajman come together, they could build a temple on their 44 acres. The waqf board could build a mosque on the model of Babri Masjid on its 22 acres, with a wall separating it from the temple.         
	What transpired between us in the discussion was very positive. There is a concrete proposal for an amicable solution. We cannot share that with you right now. But we hope to proceed and make negotiation possible in the next three months, said Gyan Das, who controls 13 Akharas (sects of sadhus), three of them in Ayodhya.         
	Mahant Bhaskar Das, chief of the Nirmohi Akhara, said he was open to negotiations. But we will meet Mahant Gyan Das before going to the media on this, he added. The Nirmohi Akhara is opposed to VHP interference in the dispute.         
	Sharma admits that the 65-year-old Gyan Das could achieve a breakthrough, which is why VHP chief Ashok Singhal had met him in early September in a bid to find an out-of-court settlement.         
	The Ayodhya dispute had remained local between December 1949, when idols were placed in the mosque, and January 1986, when the locks at the disputed site were opened.         
	But since 1986, when the VHP took charge of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and then when Syed Shahabuddin, Zafaryab Jilani, G.M. Banatwalla, Salauddin Owaisi and others formed the Babri Masjid Action Committee, the local elements from the respective communities were virtually driven out.         
	At an informal level, there are many takers for Ansaris stand against going to the Supreme Court.         
	A section of Muslims feel little purpose will be served in delaying the implementation of the high court verdict. On appeal, there appear to be four positions the apex court can take: it can completely reject the Muslim claim or it can accept that the entire land should go to the mosque, either of which would lead to communal tension; the court can decline to arbitrate in the dispute, in which case the wound would fester endlessly; or the apex court can endorse the high court verdict and divide the land between all the parties.         
	But Muslim leaders were doubtful whether Ansaris initiative with Gyan Das would lead to conciliation unless the big players like the Centre, the BJP, the Muslim personal law board and the Sunni waqf board agree to negotiate or at least take the lead in meeting each other.                     WITH INPUTS FROM RASHEED KIDWAI

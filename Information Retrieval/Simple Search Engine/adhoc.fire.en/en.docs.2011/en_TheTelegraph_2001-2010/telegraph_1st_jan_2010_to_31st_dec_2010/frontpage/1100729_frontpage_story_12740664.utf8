                                Golfing action at RCGC on Day Two of KKN presents The Telegraph Cup Golf 2010 in association with Senbo and Ballantines. (Bishwarup Dutta)                            
	Day Two of KKN presents The Telegraph Cup Golf 2010 in association with Senbo and Ballantines at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club was quiet and quirky. Brandon de Souza of Tiger Sports Marketing says it as he sees it.              
	Tee-off        
	The weather was lovely. Im telling you, god is a golfer.        
	More but muted        
	The play was quiet today but the numbers were bigger. We had around 60 yesterday but today we did around 70-odd rounds. It was quiet in terms of the top boys playing, since Bunny Lakshman Singh and Alan Singh didnt play today.        
	But theres this guy called J.P. Sarkar, he actually shot the lowest round by the time I had left the club, with 38 points.        
	I think we do the draw for fun, because nobody really adheres to the timings. Its quite funny, people show up and theyre like, Arre my time? Oh it was day before yesterday, never mind. But its all in good flavour!        
	Walkathon        
	People discussed very knowledgeably that its going to be 8km of walking  The Royal is one of the longest courses in India, five miles. Golfers were discussing how the doctors always say that walking is good for you.        
	But what these guys forget is that coming back after a game and digging into those chicken cutlets, mutton chops and beef steaks with large quantities of Kingfisher is not really what the doctors ordered! Im there to warn them.        
	Catching up        
	The real fun at the Cup is the camaraderie, the enjoyment, the laughs, the catching up of people who havent seen each other for a year. Some people were talking about how their gardens are so far away that they dont even play once in three or six months.        
	Not every garden has the benefit of a golf course in Assam whereas the Jamshedpur guys are very proud. They say You know, weve got nine holes in Beldih and now 18-holes coming up in Golmuri, literally in our backyards!        
	So we have people from different walks of life bonding outside the boardroom.        
	Ladies day out        
	Theres a separate Cup happening for the ladies with Williamson Magor winning at the moment, because theyre doing the maximum shopping at New Market, Pantaloons, Westside and AC Market. Thats the Cup where all the ladies are!        
	And thats why theres no one at the club. This bit of information was passed on to me by one of the husbands. So I told him, lets put them all on a tight shoestring budget.        
	Score sheet        
	Golf is a set of awkward contortions meant to produce a graceful result. If anybody would like to see proof of that, come and have a look at the golfers at RCGC.        
	Linked to this, there were many people coming in and struggling with their scorecards. This is the only game where you have 7, say 6 and write 5!        
	At the end of the day, nobody really cares how well or badly one played, nobody will remember who wins and loses. Its the participation which is the key. And thats why this tournament was put together.        
	Fresh face        
	Samaresh Sardar from Ichiban Facility Management scored a 69, the score of the day.              
	Braveheart        
	Jayanto Gohain. For a start, he was following Aditya Khaitans footsteps. He must have told his wife, Either Im getting a pink slip on Monday or Im in line for a promotion. He shot a 3-over.         
	Young gun        
	Biren Dey. Hes the best Bengali golfer, not because I coach him (!) but because hes the best upcoming talent. And hes built like a demi-god so its hard to tear him away from the girls.        
	Look forward to...        
	The last two days. It gets terrific when we begin to close down on the scores. Its a rush.        
	At the Final Night, we have a band and a DJ, but as long as theres Ballantines, people are happy! Its amazing what alcohol does to people.        
	If only...        
	The only thing missing now are the cheerleaders. The IPL has spoilt it for everyone.               
	(As told to Karo Christine Kumar)

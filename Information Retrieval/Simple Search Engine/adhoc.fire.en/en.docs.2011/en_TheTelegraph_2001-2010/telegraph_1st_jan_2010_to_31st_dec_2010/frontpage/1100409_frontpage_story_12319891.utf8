                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rs 499cr for red zone road revamp

	Ranchi, April 8: The Centre has sanctioned Rs 499 crore to upgrade five national highways that criss-cross Maoist strongholds in Jharkhand, a move the state government hopes will help boost its stock among tribals caught in the crossfire of an offensive against the rebels.        
	Among the roads that have been chosen for a facelift are NH-75, 75-E, NH-98, NH-99 and NH-100 that pass through various parts of the state, but existing challenges remain, given that contractors are reluctant to take up projects in these rebel-hit areas.        
	The sanction, that came early this week, was being pursued by deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto ever since he met Union home minister P. Chidambaram and minister of surface transport and highways Kamal Nath on January 28.         
	This is a major achievement on the part of the state to bring in improvements in the road sector, Mahto said.        
	We will start inviting tenders for all the stretches soon.        
	Only the dilapidated stretches of the identified highways would be taken up for repairs.        
	Originating from the borders of Uttar Pradesh, NH-75 and 75-E covers 447 km in Jharkhand, passing through Garhwa, Daltonganj, Latehar, Chandwa, Ranchi, Khunti, Chakradharpur, Chaibasa and Haatgamharia before reaching neighbouring Orissa.        
	Several stretches of the highway are in bad shape and according to Mahto, a large chunk of the Centres grant would be used to repair them.        
	Over 118 km of NH-100 passes through Jharkhand linking Chatra and Bagodar (in Giridih district), via the extremist infested Chatra-Tutilawa-Hazaribagh-Meru-Daru-Kharika route. Major intersections on this road are that of NH-99 at Chatra, NH-33 at Hazaribagh and NH-2 (Delhi-Calcutta Grand Trunk Road) at Bagodar.         
	NH-99 links Dobhi in Bihar and Chandwa in Jharkhand. It ends at the junction of NH-75. The total length of the highway is 110 km, 96 km of which passes through Jharkhand.        
	NH-98 links Patna to Rajhara in Palamau district and covers 51 km in the state.        
	The real concern for the state government now was to convince contractors to take up the projects.         
	Recently, tenders for certain stretches of the Ranchi-Daltonganj road and the dilapidated Ranchi-Chaibasa road could not be finalised despite several attempts.

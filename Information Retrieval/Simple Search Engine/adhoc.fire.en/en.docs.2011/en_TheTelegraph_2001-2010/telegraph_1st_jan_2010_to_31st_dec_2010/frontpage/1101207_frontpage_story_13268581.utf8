          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 6: Napoleon had his high horse; Nicolas Sarkozy made do with a chair and a table.        
	Barack Obama and Manmohan Singh had addressed their joint news conference last month standing behind two lecterns. But today the lecterns  the norm at such events  were missing. Singh and the visiting French President sat themselves behind a table to field questions.        
	Sources said the French delegation was uncomfortable with their President speaking from behind a lectern  because it apparently underscores his lack of height.        
	A request on the same vein by the governments protocol minders had left Delhi police flummoxed last week. The message was: find men no taller than five-foot-five to guard the French President.        
	Sources said the French had insisted that none of these security guards should be taller than the 5ft 5in (1.65m) Sarkozy.        
	That proved tough, an officer said. The Delhi police require their constables and sub-inspectors to be at least 57, although the cut-off for the police of hilly areas is 55.        
	For the army, its 52 in general but just 5ft for Gorkhas and recruits from the Northeast, Garhwal and Kumaon; and can even be 410 for those from Lakshadweep.        
	The police somehow managed to find men who, if not shorter than Sarkozy, were at least not appreciably taller. The inner ring of Sarkozys security was made up by French security officials of similar height as their Presidents.        
	In June, The Daily Telegraph had cited French media reports that quoted a French police officer as saying large-sized candidates stood little chance of being taken on as Sarkozys guards.        
	If western media reports are to be believed, Sarkozy is acutely sensitive to his lack of height and stage manages his public appearances. His wife Carla Bruni, a former model who stands at 59 (or 510, according to some accounts), has taken to wearing flat-heeled pumps whenever she appears in public with her husband.        
	Sarkozy has been photographed wearing heels that add up to two inches to his height.        
	At a meeting with the Obamas, the French President was clicked tiptoeing beside the US First Couple, both over six feet tall. Today, too, one noticed the extra height of the heels of his black shoes as he walked alongside Prime Minister Singh.        
	Last April, the Elyse Palace had objected when a German car hire firm advertised a small car with the slogan Be like Madame Bruni, take a small French model.        
	A former French ruler with whom any comparison would otherwise please Sarkozy  Napoleon  was said to be extremely sensitive about his lack of height and tried to avoid getting off his horse in public if he could.        
	The legend has sired the term Napoleon complex for the inferiority complex that some men feel because of their short stature, but current research suggests the emperor was not 52 quot; as thought but 56, which was the average height for Frenchmen of his day.        
	Sarkozy is said to have gone to extreme lengths to hide his lack of inches. A Belgian TV channel reported last year that an employee of a French factory visited by Sarkozy had admitted being chosen to stand behind him because she was no taller than him. Sarkozys office denied the report as completely absurd and grotesque.        
	In India, though, Sarkozy must have felt as comfortable as he does when he meets some of his European peers such as Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.        
	Medvedevs height is variously stated as 52 or 54, while Berlusconi is just about as tall as the French President, as is Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Among those at todays talks, Manmohan Singh and S.M. Krishna werent much taller than Sarkozy while Pranab Mukherjee and A.K. Antony were definitely shorter.        
	Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, however, is a tall man  so much so that Sarkozy is said to have caught (him) by the lapel of his jacket and called him a liar during negotiations near Moscow in 2008. The quote is from a classified US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks this past week.        
	On Friday, the BBC News website, while reporting on the leak, added tongue-in-cheek: The cable released by WikiLeaks does not specify whether Mr Sarkozy... was sitting or standing when he reportedly grabbed Mr Lavrov... known for his tall, athletic figure.

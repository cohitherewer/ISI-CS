The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CPM reclaims Lalgarh
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CPM reclaims Lalgarh
          NARESH JANA                              
	Lalgarh, Oct. 10: The CPM today reclaimed Lalgarh and re-opened its party office after some 15 months, the 11km march by flag-waving supporters briefly broken by blasts set off by Maoists in nearby jungles.        
	The Telegraph had reported in early September that the party would soon launch its assault on Lalgarh, using as springboards Dharampur, Ramgarh and Pirakata that it had recaptured since mid-August. The mission was accomplished peacefully today.        
	Holding red flags and party banners, about 10,000 CPM supporters began their march at 9.30am from Dharampur, which is 11km from Lalgarh town, the focal point of the Maoist movement in West Midnapore.        
	Headed by Binpur zonal committee chief Anuj Pandey and tailed by at least 100 supporters on motorbikes, the marchers reached Lalgarh around noon, with a minor scare triggered by sounds of gunfire and four serial blasts from the jungles of Purnapani, Bhulagera and Tarki.        
	The gunshots halted the marchers in their tracks about 7km from Lalgarh, but they resumed soon on their leaders assurances that the Maoists were deep inside the jungles. Joint forces were deployed along the route, at Jeerapara, Gohomidanga, Brindabanpur and Bamal.        
	We havent come to Lalgarh to take revenge. Weve come to re-establish control and help our comrades return home. We urge those whove strayed to return to the mainstream, said Pandey, after planting the CPM flag in the party office.        
	We appeal to all political parties to work on their individual party programmes and let us work on our own. If we have made any mistakes, we will rectify them.        
	On June 16 last year, the party office was ransacked by activists of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities and the Maoists after a meeting addressed by PCPA leader Chhatradhar Mahato. Since then, over 100 families of active CPM members had fled Lalgarh for fear of the Maoists. About 40 returned today.        
	One of the marchers, Gour Mahato, said: Weve been waiting for this day. Weve been depressed because party workers were being killed by Maoists one by one. Today we feel relieved re-establishing control in Lalgarh.        
	After Dharampur was recaptured, party leaders had said the next big destination was Lalgarh. We are happy to have achieved our goal.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose said: Nearly 12,000 people peacefully marched to Lalgarh. Now, peace and normality will return to that area.        
	The marchers came from about 100 villages under the Dharampur, Lalgarh, Belatikri and Boita gram panchayats.

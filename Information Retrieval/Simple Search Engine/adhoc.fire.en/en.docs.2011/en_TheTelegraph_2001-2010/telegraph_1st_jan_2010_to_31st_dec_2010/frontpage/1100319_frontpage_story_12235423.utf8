                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                India trip cloud on Lohan
          DEAN NELSON                       Lohan in Calcutta   in December                          
	New Delhi, March 18: Hollywood actress and model Lindsay Lohan could be blacklisted by the Indian government following her trip to the country last December when she falsely claimed she had rescued 40 child workers.        
	Her comments, which highlighted the plight of child labourers, ruffled feathers in India and alerted officials who discovered she had broken the countrys visa rules by travelling as a tourist while working on a BBC documentary.        
	The Mean Girls star had come to India to film an expose of child labour and trafficking of women which was later broadcast on BBC3, but she provoked a row when she claimed to have personally rescued 40 children.        
	In a series of updates on social networking site Twitter, she boasted of her role in a daring raid on a child labour sweatshop and claimed the experience had changed her life.        
	Over 40 children saved so far ... Within one days work ... This is what life is about ... Doing THIS is a life worth living!!! she said.        
	She later contrasted the superficiality of celebrity life with the satisfaction of social activism.        
	Focusing on celebrities and lies is so disconcerting, when we can be changing the world one child at a time ... hope everyone can see that, she said.        
	But according to activists leading the raids, Lohan did not arrive in India until after the raids had been completed and the children had been rescued.        
	Some of them had been sold by their parents for Rs 1,735 and were working 17 hours per day for as little as Rs 208 a month.        
	Activists involved in the raids criticised her comments and accused her of trivialising the issue of child trafficking.        
	Now she may not be able to visit India again after officials looked at her case and found she had failed to apply for a work visa for her trip.        
	Senior civil servants in New Delhi are now studying the case and will rule on whether her name will be added to an immigration blacklist.

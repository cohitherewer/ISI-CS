	Mumbai, Oct 20 (PTI): A 200-year-old tunnel was unearthed by the workers of the General Post Office (GPO) in its compound at south Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus.
    "Since decades the flag-hosting ceremony is conducted at this spot but we never knew about the tunnel. The lid was believed to be a drainage cover until few workers lifted them and found ladders running down," Postal Services, Director, Abha Singh said.
    The discovery of this ancient tunnel was made on Friday, after a newspaper reporter learnt about the place and informed GPO authorities to check it.
    According to GPO workers, the tunnel that resembles a "dark cave-like structure" has a vast hall, thick walls, pillars, muddy floor and unidentifiable plants with pretty flowers among other things.
    "We would visit the site and study if the place has any heritage value or historical background," Mumbai Heritage Committee, Chairman, Dinesh Afzalpurkar, said.

          SANTOSH K. KIRO                            Jharkhand Police jawans pay their last respects to Lucas Tete at his ancestral home in Porhatoli on Saturday. (Prashant Mitra)                                  
	Porhatoli (Simdega), Sept. 4: Villagers of Porhatoli today bid a tearful farewell to slain Bihar policeman Lucas Tete.        
	Residents of the 70-odd houses in the village, almost all of whom belong to the Kharia tribe, stayed up all of last night to catch a last glimpse of the villages only cop who was killed by his Maoist captors two days ago.         
	As 54-year-old Tetes mortal remains reached here at 7.30 this morning, most of those present could not hold back their tears. The elderly sobbed openly as the residents of this small hamlet near Kolebira, 150 km from the state capital, joined by those living in adjacent villages, paid tribute to a man they described as big-hearted and elder brother.        
	The district police led by superintendent Anoop Birtharay paid their last respects before the slain jamadar of Bihar Military Police (BMP) was laid to rest. Simdega MLA Bimla Pradhan, among others, joined the funeral procession and pleaded for an end to mindless killings, calling upon Maoists to shun violence and join the mainstream.        
	I would request the Bihar government to take care of the education of my brothers three daughters as he lost his life while carrying out his duty, said William Tete, elder brother of the deceased cop.        
	Tete senior tried to put up a brave face as he spoke of the familys trauma ever since news reached that his brother, the sole bread-earner, had been taken hostage by Maoist rebels in Bihars Lakhisarai. His bullet-riddled body was found at the Simra Tari Sringirishi dam in Kajra police station area of Lakhisarai yesterday.        
	Tetes wife Piyari was in shock and unable to grasp what was happening. She had gone with her three daughters Angela, Manjula and Neelam to Patna in the hope of securing her husbands release, but had to return with his lifeless body instead. As she needed immediate medical care, doctors were rushed to administer treatment in the house itself.         
	Tetes daughters, their eyes red and swollen, looked tired and defeated even as women from the village took care of those who came to attend the funeral.        
	I remember how Lucas, whose family could not afford to buy books for him due to poverty, borrowed books from me while studying in Barwadih High School. He was a good brother and a father too, recalled Angelus Kerketta, Tetes cousin from adjacent Lasia village.        
	Porhatoli, located along Ranchi-Simdega Road near Kolebira, is surrounded by thick forests. Though CPI (Maoists) rebels are active in the region, villagers said not one resident of Porhatoli is in the rebel ranks as the people are peace loving.

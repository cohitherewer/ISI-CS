          OUR BUREAU                              
	Hazaribagh/Ranchi, Aug. 19: Three members of a central team, which is in the state to review the drought situation, today visited Hazaribagh and observed that poor rainfall over two years had adversely affected crop patterns in the parched district.        
	The team, led by director of National Horticulture Board Bijay Kumar, held a closed-door meeting with district officials, including deputy commissioner Vinay Kumar Choubey and deputy development commissioner N.N. Singh, at Circuit House.         
	According to sources, the officials presented detailed data related to paddy sowing and soil moisture content besides stressing on the need for immediate relief measures. The team members asked officials to implement government schemes, especially the ones under MGNREGS.         
	Later, the three, accompanied by director of state agriculture department Deepak Kumar and Virendra Singh of Birsa Agriculture University, reached Sindoor, where they inspected a pond that was being constructed. They also dropped in at Bonga.        
	Later, the team left for Ramgarh and Chatra.        
	In Ranchi, disaster management department secretary M.N. Kerketta said she was hopeful the Centre would approve the states demand for a Rs 2,800 crore package for drought relief.        
	She added Jharkhand received 53 per cent less rainfall and transplantation of paddy hadnt been done at most places. Central aide was vital to promote alternate cropping, she added.        
	Kerketta denied claims that some Santhal Pargana districts had received good rainfall in Godda, Sahebganj and Pakur. These districts districts received only sporadic rainfall during July. Consequently, critical growth of paddy crop was badly affected.

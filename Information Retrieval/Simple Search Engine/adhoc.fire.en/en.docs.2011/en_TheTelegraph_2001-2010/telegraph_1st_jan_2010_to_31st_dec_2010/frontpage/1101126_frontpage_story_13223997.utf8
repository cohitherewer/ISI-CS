  - Protesters jump on dais and punch Hurriyat leader        OUR BUREAU                            Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq being given police protection after the assault in Chandigarh on Thursday. (PTI)                                        
	Nov. 25: Moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq was heckled and then punched by local Kashmiri Pandits and right-wing activists while he spoke at a seminar in Chandigarh today, triggering clashes in his Valley stronghold back home.        
	The assault, the third on a separatist leader, came weeks after BJP youth wing activists tried to attack separatist Shabir Shah at a news conference in Jammu.         
	Last month, a Pandit threw a shoe at Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani at a seminar in Delhi titled Azaadi  The Only Way. The shoe missed Geelani.        
	In Srinagar, mobs clashed on streets after chief minister Omar Abdullah stopped short of justifying the attack on the Mirwaiz and senior Hurriyat executive member Bilal Gani Lone, who got pushed around when he tried to save the cleric.        
	Omar said such attacks were bound to happen because of the policies pursued by the separatists, though he added that he did not condone such assaults. It is a battle of ideas and ideology. We have always given liberty to people to express their ideology, he said.        
	Police had to come out with a statement saying the Mirwaiz was safe after hundreds of stone-throwing youths enforced a shutdown in parts of the Valley.         
	In Chandigarh, the two-dozen-odd activists, including women, began assembling at the hall in Kisan Bhavan while the seminar was on.        
	The trouble started immediately after the Mirwaiz said there was a need to talk to the people of India on solving the Kashmir problem.        
	The protesters first shouted slogans like Bharat Mata ki jai, Gaddaron ko sabak sikhao (traitors need to be taught a lesson) and we will not allow any anti-India activity before a couple of them jumped on the dais and punched the Mirwaiz.        
	They also hurled chairs and flowerpots at the Mirwaiz, who narrowly escaped being hit.        
	The organisers and a few police constables present in the hall took the Mirwaiz to a corner and formed a shield around him. The entrance to the hall was locked from inside.        
	The trouble continued for nearly 30 minutes before police reinforcements arrived. Over a dozen people were detained.        
	An unruffled Mirwaiz resumed his lecture after the police restored order.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | US engine for Tejas
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                US engine for Tejas
          SUJAN DUTTA                            Light combat aircraft Tejas                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: The American firm General Electric has emerged as the lowest bidder to supply the Indian Air Force with engines for the indigenous fighter aircraft Tejas, a huge boost to the US as it vies for mega military contracts from India.        
	The US is now best placed to power the IAFs next generation of fighter aircraft.        
	This automatically gives two of the six participants in the $12-billion race to supply the IAF with medium multi-role combat aircraft an advantage.         
	Only the Boeing-made F/A-18 Super Hornet and the Swedish Saab Gripen fighters use the GE-414 engine that is now likely to power Indias light combat aircraft (LCA) Mark II.        
	The announcement by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) that GE has emerged as the lowest bidder with its GE-414 engine, beating a European consortiums EJ200 (that powers the Eurofighter Typhoon), comes even as defence minister A.K. Antony is returning from the US.        
	India is expected to buy 99 engines for the LCA Mark II, the aircraft that is scheduled to take wing by 2014. The LCA is a single-engined aircraft and is currently powered by the GE-404. The deal to buy the GE-414 could top $3 billion and lead to more orders, according to an unofficial estimate.        
	The announcement by the DRDO that GE is the lowest bidder is itself a rarity.         
	The defence establishment usually does not announce the winner of a tender till the price is finalised. But the defence establishment felt the necessity to demonstrate a commitment for acquisitions that have been held up for long.         
	If the GE-414 is adopted for the LCA, the prices of the twin-engine Super Hornet and the single-engine Gripen could come down by as much as 12 per cent, making them more attractive when the commercial bids for the medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) competition are evaluated.

	Dumka, Dec. 23: A hardcore Maoist, who had orchestrated an ambush on a police search party, killing an officer, on September 10, was today arrested from Talpahari in Kathikund block.        
	A team led by town police station officer in charge Shailesh Prasad and his Kathikund counterpart, Radheshyam Das, netted 25-year-old Sanjay Marandi alias Kajan Marandi this morning following a tip-off.        
	Superintendent of police (SP) Hemant Toppo said Marandi led an armed squad of the banned outfit comprising 30 members and was a resident of Pirtand in Giridih. He was involved in almost all ambushes on security forces in the district, Toppo added.        
	Marandi led the first-ever ambush on a police team in the district in April 2008. Then Shikaripara officer in charge Samsad Ansari and two constables were killed in the attack. A Maoist, Sebastin, and a villager also died in the ensuing encounter.        
	The Maoist ambush expert was also involved in attacks on security forces during parliamentary and Assembly elections in which a chowkidar and two BSF jawans were killed.        
	In his statement to the police, Marandi said he was motivated to join the outfit in March 2008 by Somnathda, the erstwhile CPI(Maoist) area commander in Dumka who was killed in an encounter at Khadimba village in Ramgarh police station area of the district six months ago.        
	The SP said that though an armed squad of the CPI(Maoist) was still active in some pockets of the district, the organisation had weakened. Many rebels have been arrested while others are facing opposition from local villagers, who are preventing them from organising meetings, he said, adding that this was the reason why the panchayat elections were incident-free compared to parliamentary and Assembly polls.        
	On September 10, Jama officer in charge Satanand Singh fell to rebel bullets while Jharkhand Jaguar constable Ravishankar Singh was injured in the ambush led by Marandi in Talapahari. Fourteen Maoists have been arrested since then. Police said they had procured vital information from Marandi, which will help further anti-insurgency operations in Dumka and its neighbouring areas.

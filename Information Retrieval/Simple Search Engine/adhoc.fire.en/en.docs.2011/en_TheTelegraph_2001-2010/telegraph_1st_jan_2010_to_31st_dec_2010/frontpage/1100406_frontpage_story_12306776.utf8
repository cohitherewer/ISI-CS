	Hazaribagh, April 5: A major mishap at Central Coalfield Limiteds Siwana underground mines in Bhurkunda left two dead today.         
	An estimated 100 workers were present in the mine when a portion of the roof caved in this morning.         
	According to sources, while excavating coal, miners cut out pillars to secure the roof. The pillars in turn are bolstered by wooden blocks for added safety. Once the excavation is completed, the team removes the wooden blocks and shifts them to another place.         
	This afternoon, when the two workers were busy shifting the wooden blocks from pillar-27, the roof caved in all of a sudden, killing them on the spot.        
	Senior manager of Bhurkunda project, A.L. Paul confirmed the deaths and identified the victims as Ramlal Turi and Kapil Mistri.                           
	He said all the other workers were rescued soon after the incident.        
	A worker said Kapil and Ramlal were part of a six-member team assigned the job of removing the wooden blocks supporting the pillars. As the coal started falling down, four of them managed to escape, but Ramlal and Kapil got trapped. He said nearly five to six tonne debris fell on them.        
	Sources said Kapil was a resident of Jawahar Colony, while Ramlal lived in Kursek village. A large number of villagers gathered at the spot, including relatives of victims and other employees who had entered the mine.        
	In 2005, 21 workers died in Bansgarha after water entered the underground mine.               
	In 2006, 10 illegal miners were killed when the roof of an abandoned mine collapsed in Rajrappa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tharoor quits as PM sticks to propriety
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tharoor quits as PM sticks to propriety
          SANJAY K. JHA                      Shashi Tharoor comes out after meeting the Prime Minister in New Delhi on Sunday noon. At night, Tharoor returned to submit his resignation. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, April 18: Manmohan Singh tonight secured the resignation of Shashi Tharoor as junior foreign minister, the Prime Minister playing the dispassionate umpire and signalling one of his favourite batsmen to return to the pavilion over the IPL mess.        
	If Tharoor began his political career with the flamboyance that defines Twenty20, his tenure of less than a year has been as short as the pint-sized version of cricket that set the stage for his downfall.        
	The focus now shifts to the IPL top management. Many Congress leaders, especially the younger lot, want the government to rip open the IPLs dark underbelly and bring under the glare the operations of Lalit Modi whose close association with some BJP leaders is well known.        
	Tharoor met the Prime Minister tonight after the Congress core group arrived at the conclusion that protecting him would neither be easy nor wise. Tharoor had called on Singh in the morning, too, and explained his position, stressing that he was innocent and blaming IPL commissioner Modi for the crisis.        
	The core group, however, was not impressed by his simplistic line of defence and decided that there was no point in dragging the matter.        
	Contrary to a perception among some Congress leaders that the Prime Minister would support the minister he cherry-picked, Singh did not try to defend him, sources said.        
	The sources said Sonia Gandhi, too, did not speak much at the meeting which took over two hours primarily because the Prime Minister was given a thorough briefing on the episode.        
	The meeting was also attended by Pranab Mukherjee, A.K. Antony, P. Chidambaram and Ahmed Patel. None spoke up for Tharoor but all aspects of the controversy, apart from the possible fallout, were discussed.        
	The announcement by Tharoors friend Sunanda Pushkar earlier in the day that she was giving up the sweat equity given to her in the Kochi IPL consortium also did not cut ice with the Congress core group. The surrender was seen as a last-ditch attempt by the Tharoor camp to salvage his post.        
	The sweat equity was at the root of the controversy as it fuelled allegations that Sunanda was being given the largesse as an indirect reward to Tharoor  a charge the minister has repeatedly denied.        
	It was decided that the Prime Minister would ask Tharoor to resign and the development would be made public tonight itself, not waiting for another round of ruckus in Parliament tomorrow.        
	After meeting Tharoor, Singh had a brief conversation with Sonia over the phone. Tharoor did not speak to the waiting media but indicated his intent by using a personal car, instead of his official vehicle, to reach 7 Racecourse Road for handing over his resignation.        
	A late-night statement issued by the Prime Ministers media adviser said: Shashi Tharoor, minister of state for external affairs, has submitted his resignation from the council of ministers to the Prime Minister today. The Prime Minister has forwarded his resignation letter to the President with a recommendation that it be accepted.        
	The sources said near-unanimity existed among the core group members that Tharoor had caused embarrassment to the party by getting embroiled in an avoidable mess and his attempt to invoke Kerala pride to justify the venture was almost childish. Nothing much was left to deliberate on the merits of the case as the leadership had already made up its mind.        
	The party waited for the Prime Ministers return from abroad as removing a minister in his absence would have raised questions of impropriety. Sonia had already asked Mukherjee and Antony to study the case and prepare a report for the Prime Minister to act upon.        
	Although a younger section thought Singh might defend Tharoor if no direct link to corruption could be established, no seasoned leader expected the Prime Minister to overrule the partys assessment.        
	Singh is neither known to defend someone facing charges of impropriety nor does he interfere too much in organisational matters. It is Sonia who invariably takes such decisions, and the advice of both Mukherjee and Antony is usually given weight.        
	With Tharoor out of the way, IPL chief Modis alleged closeness with former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje has become a topic of discussion in Congress circles.        
	One young minister of state, who wondered till yesterday if lesser mortals like him too will be treated like Tharoor, told The Telegraph today: We cant sit idle and watch the rot in the IPL. We must expose everybody now and show the true face of the BJP.         
	The tide of sympathy for Tharoor started rising after the word went out yesterday that his exit was almost certain. Many leaders who could not stomach his lifestyle and tweeting habit started contending that the minister was after all new to the cesspool of politics.        
	He is too precious to be lost. He should learn the tricks of the trade and return sooner than later, a minister said, expressing the hope that Tharoor would be given another chance some day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | He speaks through art of silence
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                He speaks through art of silence

	Subhajit Bagui was disowned by his father when he was a few months old. Born with speech and hearing disabilities, the 18-year-old mime performer grew up at his maternal uncles place near Serampore and was brought up by his aunt.        
	Despite his disabilities, Subhajit insisted on going to school. In 1999, at the age of seven, he started attending the Serampore Child Guidance Centre, a school for children with special needs.        
	When he joined the school, he didnt know how to read or write. But he caught on quick and received consecutive double promotions. And he has always been very social, says Aruna Devi, the founder and principal of the centre and a former Unicef project co-ordinator for prevention of childhood disability. Now 18, Subhajit is appearing for the Madhyamik examination in 2011.        
	Along with learning to read and write, Subhajit shined at extra-curricular activities as well, especially theatre. Things took a different turn when mime exponent Ranen Chakraborty  the founder of the Calcutta-based mime troupe Mimic  was appointed as the teacher at the Serampore institution in 2000.        
	From the very beginning, I noticed that Subhajit was extraordinary. Not only did he pick up the basics of mime very quickly, he was expressive, which is a crucial factor in mastering the subtler nuances of the art form, says Chakraborty.        
	He took Subhajit under his wings, coaching him at the school and often taking him to various mime and theatre performances in Calcutta. It is his need to express which makes him so passionate about mime. It is a silent art, and for one who lives in a world of silence, I think mime is the perfect form of expression, feels Chakraborty.        
	On November 20, the Serampore Child Guidance Centre held its 25th anniversary programme at the local Rabindra Bhavan. Apart from song and dance recitals, the special children performed Tagores Taasher Desh and Birpurush.        
	Subhajit played the protagonist in the latter. Its the first time that the students attempted Tagore works.        
	Chakraborty plans to work with Subhajit as part of Mimic. He rues that distance plays a major hurdle in taking that next step. I visit the Serampore school once a week; that is not enough to coach Subhajit for professional mime performances. I hope we can work out something in the near future, says the mime veteran, who has moved away from the stage and has been performing street mime over the last few years where even beggars at the Nandan courtyard come and pay us.        
	For Subhajit, that would be another dream come true, another level of acceptance where he would speak his language in the sound of silence.

          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 8: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today announced a policy decision to reserve 10 per cent of government jobs for disadvantaged sections of backward-class Muslims in Bengal, prodded by allies to spring a potential vote-catcher ahead of key elections.        
	There is a 7 per cent reservation in government jobs for the Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Now we have taken a policy decision to increase it to 17 per cent, of which 10 per cent would be exclusively for the socially, educationally and economically disadvantaged among backward-class Muslims of our state whose family income per year does not exceed Rs 4.5 lakh. This reservation will be for government jobs. We will consider later whether to introduce this quota in education, the chief minister said.        
	Asked whether the government move suggested reservation along religious lines, Bhattacharjee said: The 10 per cent reservation will not be on the basis of religion. It will be for the benefit of those Muslims who are backward socially, economically and educationally.        
	The crippling and successive electoral blows to the CPM in Bengal have been partly attributed to the alienation of Muslims whose overall condition has remained abysmal after 33 years of Left rule. The communitys grievances crystallised after the Sachar committee findings were made public in 2006. ( )         
	With the Left losing ground among the minorities, Mamata Banerjee has been going out of her way to court them. The Trinamul Congress described the governments move as a political gimmick.        
	Although the chief minister was keen to take some more time, the allies apparently prevailed upon him to make the announcement, which can be contrasted against the Centres inaction.        
	Asked if the civic polls in May and the Assembly polls in 2011 had a bearing on the timing of the announcement, Bhattacharjee said: The Ranganath Misra report was tabled recently and thats why we took the decision on reservation now. So, the timing was more or less the same. The Centre hasnt prepared the action-taken report on the Misra commission recommendations. We, in our own way, decided to introduce the 10 per cent reservation for Muslims who constitute 25 per cent of our states population.        
	The Misra commission, appointed by the Centre, had recommended 10 per cent reservation for Muslims, without specifying whether only the backward among the community should be covered.        
	The CPM has been citing this to draw a distinction between the Misra recommendation, which could be interpreted as a religious quota, and the partys preference for special treatment to only the disadvantaged sections among the Muslims. This distinction will help the government counter suggestions that the quota is based on religion.        
	 The quota announced by Bhattacharjee today covers only the Muslim backward communities, which number 12 in Bengal now.        
	The Muslim community does not officially have a caste system but a classification exists on the base of occupation such as Jolha (weavers), Kasai (butchers), Nashya Sekh (construction workers), Shersha Badia (cultivators) and Hajjam (barbers).        
	The other Muslim groups classified backward in Bengal, which means they are eligible for the 10 per cent job reservation, are Fakir, Hawari, Dhunia, Pahadia Muslim, Rayeen Kunjra, Chowdhuli and Patidar. The 12 groups together account for 16.83 lakh (8.3 per cent) of the 2.02 crore Muslims in the state.        
	State backward classes welfare secretary B.P. Gopalika said three more communities  Khotta, Sardar and Beldar  were likely to get OBC status shortly. These three populous groups have 10.4 lakh members.        
	The 10 per cent quota takes the total job reservations in the state to 45 per cent (22 per cent for Scheduled Castes, 6 per cent for Scheduled Tribes and 7 per cent for OBCs), which is 4 percentage points below the 49 per cent legal limit.

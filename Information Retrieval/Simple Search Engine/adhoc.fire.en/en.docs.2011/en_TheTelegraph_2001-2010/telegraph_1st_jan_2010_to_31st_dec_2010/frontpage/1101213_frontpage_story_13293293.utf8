	Stockholm, Dec. 12: A suspected suicide bombing that could have been truly catastrophic has hit the heart of Sweden, bringing under the shadow of terror a country that has long prided itself on having created a stable and peaceful society at home.        
	Two explosions rocked Stockholms city-centre shopping district of Drottninggatan on Saturday evening in the middle of the Christmas season, killing a man and injuring two persons in the first such attack in the Nordic country. The dead person was suspected to be a suicide bomber.        
	A parked car exploded first, shortly before 5pm Stockholm time. A second blast followed minutes later, about 200 yards from the first. The mans body was discovered after the second explosion.        
	 The countrys foreign minister called the blasts a terrorist attack, and an email to news organisations minutes before the blasts seemed to link them to anger over anti-Islamic cartoons and the war in Afghanistan.        
	Sweden has avoided involvement in the upheavals that have ravaged much of the rest of Europe in modern times, including World War II. Sweden has previously escaped the types of bombings mounted elsewhere in Europe since 9/11. The Swedish militarys current deployment in Afghanistan is a rare departure.        
	Another significant change has been the impact of heavy immigration, especially Muslims. Their growing numbers, and the furore surrounding artist Lars Vilkss cartoons, have contributed to a rise in tensions. Muslims account for 5 per cent of Swedens 9.3 million people.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Calcutta, March 18: A vast expanse of free land and lure of high grade iron ore from Chiria mines is bringing South Korean steel major Posco to Bokaro.        
	The company, which has been kept waiting for the last five years in Orissa to break ground for its Rs 52,000 crore investment, will team up with public sector Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) for the Jharkhand venture, a new half a million tonne steel plant for now.        
	Both companies have been in dialogue exploring joint venture opportunities for some time but they have now zeroed in on Bokaro where SAIL runs a steel plant spread over a 34,000 acre area.         
	But the PSU only utilises 14,000 acre for its existing operations. The rest can  and will be  used for building the new plant.         
	SAIL had earlier proposed to build a plant alone to secure for itself the Chiria mine iron ore reserves, but has now changed stance to add Posco as JV partner. Posco will have 60 per cent ownership, while the remaining will be with SAIL.        
	A Posco spokesperson confirmed the development, but said the talks were in initial stages. SAIL officials were unavailable for comment.        
	It is learnt that the PSU will bring in land as its share of the investment for the project. Posco will build the plant employing its proprietary Finex technology that uses low grade iron ore fines to produce steel.        
	A Posco team, led by CEO Chung Jun-Yang, attended a dinner with the SAIL top brass and steel ministry officials on Monday where the deal was formalised. The very next day, the team went for a recce at the plant site in Bokaro  their fifth in the last two months.         
	In Bokaro, SAIL already runs a 4.5 million tonne per annum (MTPA) plant which it is expanding to 7.5 (MTPA) as part of its Rs 70,000 crore expansion programme.        
	Posco and SAIL are already in pact for supply of technology and technical know-how.        
	SAIL had earlier proposed to build a 15 MT plant in Jharkhand in return for a promise from the former government of Madhu Koda for access to Chiria mine resources.        
	Both Koda and before him, Arjun Munda, ran into a spat with SAIL over Chiria mines with the state cancelling some of its mining leases with the PSU. The steel ministry under Ramvilas Paswan then proposed that SAIL be given one billion tonne reserves for existing plants and another one billion when the PSU puts up another 15 MT plant.        
	If the Posco deal goes through, SAIL would get access to Chiria mines without spending much. But the benefits would be more for Posco who can now reasonably hope for building an integrated steel plant without having to tread the treacherous road of land acquisition as in Orissa where local protest has stalled the project.        
	It is still early days to finalise the capacity of the proposed plant, but agencies said two companies would start off with half a million tonne and then scale upto 4-5 MT later, promising an investment of Rs 15,000 crore.        
	A Posco-SAIL deal when signed could change the paradigm of the steel industry.         
	It would spur other multinationals like ArcelorMittal, Nippon Steel, JFE Steel, Sumitomo and local majors like Tata, JSW and NMDC, to forge alliances to build new plants to skirt land acquisition and mine allocation delays.

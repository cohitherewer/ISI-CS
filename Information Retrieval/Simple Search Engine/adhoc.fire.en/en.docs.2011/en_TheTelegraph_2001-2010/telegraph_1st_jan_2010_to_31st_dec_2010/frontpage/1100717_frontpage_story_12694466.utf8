          ARCHIS MOHAN                      ON THE PHONE? EXTRAORDINARY
  rsquo;Krishna addressing the media in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI) 
                          
	New Delhi, July 16: Their mandate was to chart out a roadmap for resumption of dialogue between the two countries.        
	But even before they started walking on that path, the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers disagreed on whether to take small or big steps to cover what has never been an easy journey in the past 60 years.        
	Beyond the barbs that continued to fly today, the verdict on the foreign minister-level talks was evident: a failure.        
	India expressed its hurt at the talks not having yielded expected results but said it had kept open the door for future engagement with Pakistan. Pakistan has a tormented psychology when it comes to dealing with India. When dealing with Pakistan, we hope for the best but expect the worst, said a highly placed source.        
	The dialogue between the two neighbours is in tatters and the challenge is how to put Humpty Dumpty together again, the source added.        
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna maintained that the two neighbours had made some headway and had a better understanding of each others positions.        
	We told them terror is the biggest stumbling block and as long as that is not dealt with, any movement on other issues will remain futile, Krishna said after returning from Islamabad.        
	Krishna and external affairs ministry officials tried hard to put up a facade of the Thimphu spirit being still alive between New Delhi and Islamabad. But the disappointment of returning home empty-handed was evident.        
	The stumbling block was Pakistans insistence that the two sides should resume the composite dialogue, take big steps and discuss all outstanding issues, including terrorism.        
	India thought the time was not ripe to discuss all issues till Pakistan delivered on its promises on the terror front made since February and iterated during Union home minister P. Chidambarams visit last month. India favoured baby steps to first bridge the trust deficit before any intense dialogue was started. There is a need for a warm-up period, said a source.        
	Indian government sources said the two sides were well aware of each others positions but the Pakistani political leadership, under pressure from the ISI, was not on the same page.         
	India was fully prepared. Our mandate was clear. There was no ambiguity, said Krishna.        
	An ironical casualty of the talks having failed was delay in announcement of home secretary-level talks. Sources said Krishna was to announce the talks. Pakistani interior minister Rehman Malik had phoned the Indian high commission in Islamabad twice in the run-up to the talks to confirm the dates. But Qureshi jettisoned the move, a source said.        
	On his part, Qureshi decided to give vent to his frustration by holding a news conference even before Krishnas entourage could leave Pakistani soil.         
	Qureshi alleged that during their meeting Krishna was more occupied with taking instructions from Delhi over the phone than having a dialogue. A charge that Krishna denied.        
	It is (Qureshis comments) an extraordinary statement to make... I did not use any phone. My mandate was so precise and clear that I did not need any clarification from Delhi, Krishna said.        
	But Krishna, who later briefed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, added: I am not going to score debating points with Qureshi. I would like to concentrate on serious issues.        
	Government sources termed Qureshis behaviour bad etiquette, something that the Pakistani school of diplomatic thought was infamous for, citing a similar news conference by Pervez Musharraf during the Agra summit.        
	In fact, Qureshi seemed to have done Krishna a favour with his fresh attack. Krishnas failure to defend G.K. Pillai at yesterdays news conference after Qureshi compared the Indian home secretarys comments on the ISIs role in Mumbai to that of Hafiz Saeeds anti-India speeches had received much flak.        
	However, Krishna seemed to find support from across the political spectrum after Qureshis comments today. The BJP urged the Centre to call off the dialogue with Pakistan but was muted in criticising Krishna. The Congress condemned described Qureshis remarks and supported Krishnas decision not to get into a slanging match.        
	India has invited Qureshi to New Delhi in December but is not hopeful of any big breakthrough.

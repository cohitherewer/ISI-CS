The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Riot police seal Cannes
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Riot police seal Cannes
          AMIT ROY                            French police seal off a road to the Cannes Film Festival                                  
	Cannes, May 21: Armed police in full riot gear today sealed off all approaches to the venue of the Cannes Film Festival after angry protesters threatened to disrupt a movie which has clearly reopened the still raw wounds of the Algerian independence movement.        
	Over 1,200 demonstrators marched towards the Palais des Festival to make clear their view that Hors la Loi (Outside the Law) has twisted history and reduced the honour of French soldiers by making them resemble butchers.        
	Armed policemen were deployed in such strength that even journalists found they could not get into the theatre, probably an unprecedented event at a festival where the French encourage freedom of expression for Iranians, Africans and other oppressed people.        
	Those who managed to squeeze their way through  and The Telegraph was one of them  were subjected to strict airline style security and even had bottled water confiscated.        
	Algeria became independent in 1962 after a civil war of exceptional brutality in which the French state did everything in its power to crush a liberation movement that hit back with equal ferocity.        
	Hors la Loi, which is competing for the top prize at Cannes, the Palme DOr, had become mired in controversy even before todays premiere. It has been written and directed by Rachid Bouchareb, who is himself a French Algerian born and brought up in Paris.        
	Cinema must be able to broach all subjects, the director said. I knew that the colonial past and the relationship with the colonial past between France and Algeria is still very tense but I think the reaction and all the things that have been said before anyones seen the film, have been excessive.         
	It was left to the police to hold back flag-waving demonstrators, including military veterans and supporters of the far-Right National Front.        
	 Their fury was expressed by Jacques Peyrat, a veteran and former French senator, who said: What we want to make clear by demonstrating is that it is intolerable that public money from France can be used to sully the French army and Frances actions in Algeria.        
	Outside the Law follows on from the directors 2006 film, Days of Glory, which told the story of North African soldiers who fought for France during the World War II.        
	The current film focuses on three brothers, played by Jamel Debbouze, Roschdy Zem and Sami Bouajila, three of the four actors from Days of Glory who won a collective best actor prize at Cannes in 2006.        
	The film shows a notorious incident in 1945 when French troops opened fire on pro-independence demonstrators, sparking an outburst of violence in which thousands of Algerians and around 100 Europeans were killed.        
	Thousands died in the brutal Algerian war for independence from France, a conflict that has left deep and still-unhealed scars in both countries, said Bouchareb.        
	He hoped the film would help foster an open debate and then we should move on to something else.         
	The makers of the film denied that the film was anti-French. France is a great country and this film will contribute, along with others, to the memory of what happened in history, said Tarak Ben Ammar, one of the co-producers. I dont think there will be any problems for French people in dealing with this subject, he said.

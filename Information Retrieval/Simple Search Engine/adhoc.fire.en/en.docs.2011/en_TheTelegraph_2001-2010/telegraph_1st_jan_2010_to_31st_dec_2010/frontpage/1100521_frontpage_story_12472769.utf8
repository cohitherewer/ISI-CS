                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Coal, iron ore next on auction list
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                            In the pipeline                                  
	New Delhi, May 20: After telecom, coal and iron ore mining licences will be up for auctions soon.         
	Top finance ministry officials said the government had given the go-ahead to the coal ministry to come up with coal block auctions.         
	Officials said an ordinance might be issued to amend section 3 of the Coal Nationalisation Act to allow the auctioning of blocks to user industries  steel, power and cement companies.         
	At present, these entities are given blocks through allotments, and the system is dogged with allegations of corruption and nepotism. Many coal allotment licences are later traded for a sizeable sum.         
	The Prime Ministers Office, the finance ministry as well as the Planning Commission want an auction system for coal blocks similar to that of telecom.         
	Plan panel advisers have said auctions are the only way to ensure that investments of Rs 1,18,000 crore can be brought in to ramp up production to 1,061 million tonnes a year by 2025.         
	Allocated resources are never exploited properly ... but once purchased at a fair auction at high prices, buyers will do their best to exploit resources to extract profit from their investments, plan panel advisers said.         
	Blocks that have been fully explored for coal availability as well as blocks needing further exploration will be put up for bidding.        
	Preference will be given to companies that propose to set up washeries or end-use industry in the same state. If such a companys offer is within 5 per cent of the highest bidder, which does not have any plan to set up an allied industry in the state, the former will be offered the mine but will have to match the highest bid.         
	Part of the money from the auction will be earmarked for rehabilitation and community development projects in the coal bearing areas, which are mostly on tribal lands.         
	The government also wants states to agree to a similar auction of iron ore mines. A proposed new policy forbids allocation of mines to companies on the basis of promises of future investments in the state.         
	Officials said the Mines and Minerals (Development amp; Regulation) Act 1957 may be amended to introduce competitive bidding for non-coal minerals in the monsoon session of Parliament.

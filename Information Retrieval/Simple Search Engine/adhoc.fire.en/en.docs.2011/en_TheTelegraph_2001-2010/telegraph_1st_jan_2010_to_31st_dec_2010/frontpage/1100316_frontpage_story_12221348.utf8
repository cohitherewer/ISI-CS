          SUJAN DUTTA                                              
	New Delhi, March 15: The Indian and Bangladeshi militaries are set to increase exchanges after the top brass from both sides met in Delhi during the Bangladesh army chiefs visit today and concluded that relations had improved vastly over the past three years.         
	An army source also said that talks with the visiting Bangladesh army chief, General Muhammad Abdul Mubeen, covered increased co-operation in dealing with insurgents who have been operating from camps near the border.        
	Indias effort to improve military relations with Bangladesh was stepped up since 2008. Part of the reason for the renewal of effort was a concern that Bangladeshs military was intensifying its exchanges with China. Bangladesh holds war exercises with the Chinese military but not with India. But it deputes officers to attend courses in Indian military institutions.With the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government also helping India in dealing with Northeast-based insurgents, New Delhi is now eager that the militaries co-operate more.        
	General Mubeen is visiting India this week at the same time as the Indian Army is hosting a group of Bangladesh war veterans in north Bengal where the Indian Army had set up camps to train the mukti joddhas (freedom fighters) in the 1971 war that led to the creation of Bangladesh from erstwhile East Pakistan.         
	 The Indian Air Force has offered the Bangladesh Biman Bahini (Bangladesh Air Force) use of its facilities to modernise and maintain fighter aircraft and helicopters.        
	The Indian Navy is also now considering refurbishing and repairing the Bangladesh Navys frigates.        
	The visit assumes special significance in the light of improving military co-operation between the two countries in consonance with Indias growing relationship with Bangladesh, a defence ministry statement said.        
	Like his predecessor in 2008, General Mubeen is meeting, apart from the service chiefs, defence minister A.K. Antony and national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon. He is slated to visit Calcutta on March 18 where he will be hosted by the Eastern Command headquarters in Fort William. Before that he will also visit the South Western Command in Jaipur.         
	General Mubeen is accompanied by his wife and four senior officers.        
	The visit would further cement our defence relationship with Bangladesh and add impetus to our ongoing defence co-operation. Maintenance of enhanced military-to-military contacts with Bangladesh by Indian Army is mutually beneficial to the strategic interests of both, the defence ministry statement said.

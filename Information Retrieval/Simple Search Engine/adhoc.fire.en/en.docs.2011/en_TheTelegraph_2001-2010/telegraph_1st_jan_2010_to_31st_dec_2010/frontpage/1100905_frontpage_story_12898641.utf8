	New Delhi, Sept. 4: The final leg of the construction and clean-up scramble linked to the Commonwealth Games may encounter more trouble with rainfall.         
	Indias weather agency has said the withdrawal of the monsoon from the north-western parts of the country will be delayed by two weeks.         
	The monsoon usually begins withdrawing from western parts of Rajasthan around September 1. But given the current position of the monsoon and the continued flow of easterly winds over north-west India, the withdrawal is not expected to start until the middle of September, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.         
	In its weekly assessment of the monsoon, the IMD has also predicted heavy and widespread rainfall across parts of north-western and central India, and the northern peninsula over the next three to four days.         
	The total rainfall during the monsoon season has so far been only 1 per cent below normal.         
	The delays in the preparations for the Commonwealth Games as well as a spurt in the number of dengue cases this year have been blamed by city officials on excess rainfall in the capital.         
	The IMD has predicted that rainfall in September across India will be 15 per cent above normal.

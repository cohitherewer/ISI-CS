	New Delhi, May 19 (PTI): Congress today steered clear of the clemency issue of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, saying it was a matter to be decided by the President, the central government and Delhi government which have the all the facts.        
	There is no need to comment... It is outside our purview, Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said at a press briefing when asked for the partys views on Afzal mercy petition regarding which the file is going back and forth between the Delhi government and Lt Governor Tejinder Khanna.        
	 Singhvi said it was a Constitutional process and a decision had to be taken by the President, the Central government and Delhi government which have all the facts.        
	 He said there are competent people in these institutions who will take the decision.        
	 The Delhi government, which had been sitting on Afzals file for last four years, on Monday sent it to the Lt Governor with comments that it had no objection to the hanging but its implications on law and order needed to be kept in mind.        
	 The Lt Governor returned it yesterday, seeking more clarity of opinion.        
	 The Delhi government today sent it back with some minor clarifications.

	Dibrugarh, Dec. 25: Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Baruas son Arindam was released today by his unknown abductors, after being reportedly tortured and interrogated about his father.        
	In a statement emailed to media houses, Ulfa publicity secretary Arunudoy Dohotia claimed Arindam was grilled about his fathers assets, his location and also his purported businesses.         
	Dohotia further added that they have identified a few of the abductors and are investigating the matter.        
	The statement however, did not mention when the boy was kidnapped or released.        
	The news of the release of Arindam should come as a big relief for Paresh Baruas octogenarian mother, Miliki Barua, who was admitted at a private nursing home in Tinsukia town after her health deteriorated following the news of her grandsons abduction.        
	Bikul Barua, brother of Paresh Barua, said their mother had been admitted to hospital late last night after she suffered from utter shock and nervousness due to the disturbing news of the abduction of her grandson in Bangladesh.         
	The 82-year-old stays at Jeraigaon under Chabua police station in Dibrugarh district with the families of her eldest son Bimal and youngest son Bikul.         
	Doctors termed her condition stable. We have put her under observation. Apart from having some stomach-related problems, she is suffering from old age ailments, one of the doctors said over telephone.        
	The news of the abduction of Arindam, who is reportedly a Class IX student in a Dhaka school, had upset Miliki so much that she had even threatened to hit the national highway to seek his safe release.        
	Various organisations, including the All Assam Moran Students Union, too, had aired strong reactions on the news of the abduction. If the news is true, then it will definitely impact the ongoing peace process. We, therefore, urge all sections of people to come forward and help solve the crisis, said Arun Jyoti Chutia, president of the students union.        
	The possibility of two senior Ulfa leaders  Jibon Moran and Dristi Rajkhowa  coming overground to join the peace process had also made news recently.         
	Moran, who is considered to be very close to Paresh Baruah, had till now opposed the peace process.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Gadkari's language highly derogatory, says Congress
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Gadkari's language highly derogatory, says Congress
 															      
	New Delhi, May 13 (PTI): A day after Nitin Gadkari made objectionable remarks against RJD chief Lalu Prasad and SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav and later said he would take them back if the two leaders felt bad, Congress today said the BJP president used highly derogatory language.  
	 rdquo;It is highly derogatory language. But we are not surprised... Soon after Gadkari was made BJP President, it was said that his stature was not of a national politician. He is justifying this impression with this kind of language, rdquo; party spokesman Shakeel Ahmed said.  
	 Another party spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan termed Gadkari's remarks as ldquo;shocking and outrageous rdquo;, saying he should apologise to the nation for bringing politics to such a low. Yesterday at Chandigarh, Gadkari used derogatory insinuations against Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav for not supporting the opposition during cut motions in the Lok Sabha. Later, he however offered to take back the words if the two Yadavs felt bad.

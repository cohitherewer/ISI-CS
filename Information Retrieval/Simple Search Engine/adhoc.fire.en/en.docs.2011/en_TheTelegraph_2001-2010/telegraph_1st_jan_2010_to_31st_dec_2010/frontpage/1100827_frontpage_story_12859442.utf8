          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Panel protection                                  
	Ranchi, Aug. 26: For the first time since Jharkhand came into existence 10 years ago, the state has taken an earnest step towards constituting an expert appraisal committee and an enforcing agency/authority to look into the possible impact of mining, industry and other non-forest activity on the environment.         
	A proposal to this effect was sent to the Union ministry of environment and forests by the state forest and environment department recently.         
	Principal chief conservator of forests (wasteland development board) C.R. Sahay said the state is now awaiting clearance from the Union ministry.        
	Sahay, who is also chairman of the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB), said any non-forestry work, including mining either in forest or non-forest areas, will be cleared by the committee/authority if the total area concerned is less than five hectares.         
	Such proposals would be appraised by the committee while consent to start the project would be given by a state environmental impact assessment agency/authority, provided norms are followed.         
	State forest secretary A.K. Sarkar said the committees role would be to assess the impact of proposed non-forest activities on the local flora and fauna.        
	Sources said such a committee and agency/authority exists in a majority of states, but a laggard administration in Jharkhand did little to set them up here. This has resulted in rampant illegal mining of precious minerals like bauxite and iron ore in Lohardaga, Latehar, Gumla and West Singhbhum, among other districts.        
	Recently, in the absence of such a committee and agency/authority, the state administration referred the forest diversion proposal of Congress MP Naveen Jindal-owned Jindal Steel and Power Limited (JSPL) directly to the Union ministry without doing the groundwork.         
	Sarkar said the committee would have 10 to 12 members, who would be experts in the field of flora, fauna, environment and forests. It will be headed by an official of the rank of principal chief conservator of forests.         
	Any proposal cleared by the committee and agency/authority at the state level would be then looked into by similar authorities at the central level. The latter would have the final say for clearing big mining/industrial projects.

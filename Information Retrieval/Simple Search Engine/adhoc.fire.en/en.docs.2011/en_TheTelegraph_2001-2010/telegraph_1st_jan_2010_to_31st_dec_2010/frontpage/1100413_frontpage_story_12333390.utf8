The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mean feet trips Sarah Brown
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mean feet trips Sarah Brown
          AMIT ROY                            Sarah Brown at the Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden, North London, on Monday                                  
	London, April 12: Sarah Brown has hardly put a foot wrong in her role as the British prime ministers wife  until yesterday, that is, when she took off her shoes to enter the Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden, north London.        
	Somewhat ungallantly, todays Daily Mail has focussed on her feet and suggested that she is badly in need of a pedicure.        
	As the general election campaign intensifies with the Labour party releasing its manifesto today, the battle of the wives is also hotting up with 46-year-old Sarah pitched against SamCam, as David Camerons pregnant wife, Samantha, 38, has been dubbed by the tabloid press.        
	So far, the Hindu vote has not been cultivated but Sarah made amends of sorts by attending a conference to mark international womens day at the temple.        
	Celebrating Women: Past, Present and Future had been organised by the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), which describes itself as a socio-spiritual Hindu organisation with its roots in the Vedas.        
	 To be fair to be Sarah, she was not hitting the campaign trail but her mere presence and the fact she was given a platform could not fail to send a none too subtle message to Hindu voters that Labour was the party for them.        
	With the latest polls predicting that the Tories will emerge the largest party in the next parliament but perhaps not win an overall majority, the support of Indian-origin voters in key marginals is assuming disproportionate importance.        
	 According to devotees, the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, London  popularly known as the Neasden Temple  is the first traditional Hindu Mandir in Europe. 2,820 tonnes of Bulgarian limestone and 2,000 tonnes of Italian Carrara marble were shipped to India, carved by over 1,500 craftsmen and reshipped to London.         
	In all, 26,300 carved pieces were assembled like a giant jigsaw puzzle in less than three years. It is a miracle of modern times worked by over a thousand volunteers. It is a masterpiece of exotic design and workmanship. Since its opening in August 1995, the Mandir has attracted devotees and visitors from all over the world.        
	Sarah, who was garlanded on arrival, said in a speech after touring the temple: I can entirely understand why it is often referred to as the eighth wonder of the world, but I suspect what keeps thousands and thousands of people coming back here is not just how beautiful a building it is, but the warmth of the welcome and the compassion of the community.        
	 Armed with close-ups of Sarahs feet, the Daily Mail was determined to trip her up.        
	 Captioning a photograph with the punning, No mean feet, it said that the wife of Labour leader Gordon Brown should have been putting her best foot forward when she visited a temple in north-west London. Instead she unveiled a rather unsightly problem on her left foot  her little toe and fourth toe crossed over one another.        
	It added: She has been placed in direct competition with David Camerons wife Samantha, and this will do little to boost her credentials against SamCam. In fact, its the kind of sight that will immediately put the Prime Ministers wife into second place behind the Tory leaders wife.        
	According to the rules of the spectacular Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, which is Europes first traditional Hindu temple, visitors must remove their shoes, the paper explained to readers. She would have been well aware that her toes were in such a frightful condition, however, and most likely decided against a pedicure...to her detriment.        
	In this election, no prisoners are being taken  and certainly not by the Daily Mail.        
	Another photograph had an even unkinder caption: This little piggy...        
	 Many in the audience addressed by Sarah would have been Gujarati businessmen who may well he inclined to support the Tories. Whether Sarah has been able to persuade some of them remains to be seen.

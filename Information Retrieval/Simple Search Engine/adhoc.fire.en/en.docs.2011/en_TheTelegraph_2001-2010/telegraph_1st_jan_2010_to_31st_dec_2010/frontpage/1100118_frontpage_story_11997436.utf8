          A STAFF REPORTER                      Mamata Banerjee outside the Salt Lake hospital where Jyoti Basu breathed his last on Sunday. Pictures by Amit Datta                          
	Calcutta, Jan. 17: Mamata Banerjee today paid tributes to Jyoti Basu but packed in a punch at his party, saying he was the last chapter of the Left movement in Bengal.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief took care to stress that her emotional bond with Basu related to the last 10 years, that is after he had stepped down as chief minister. But she avoided any mention of their bitter enmity during Basus long rule.        
	I am grief-stricken at the news of Jyoti Basus death, just as his party workers are. For the last 10 years, I used to visit him quite often. He loved to discuss things with me, the railway minister said.        
	I still remember that he had personally requested me to be present during his birthday in 2007. I kept his request by going straight to Indira Bhavan from Trivandrum to wish him. Really, in the last 10 years, I had developed an emotional bond with him.        
	Mamata has cancelled all her protest programmes from today till Tuesday and demanded a three-day state mourning.        
	She had rushed to the Salt Lake hospital after learning of Basus death, which she said was a great loss to all of us.        
	She added: Basu was instrumental in installing the Left Front government in Bengal. I consider him the last chapter of the Left movement here.        
	Other Trinamul leaders, however, did not fight shy of speaking about the Basu-Mamata rancour of the 90s, when the then chief minister would repeatedly attack her as a 420 (cheat) and liar, accusing her of flaunting a fake doctorate from a foreign university.        
	They recalled the most acrimonious episode of January 7, 1993, when Mamata, then a junior minister in the Narasimha Rao government, was physically removed from Writers Buildings at Basus behest.        
	Mamata had sat on a dharna outside the chief ministers chamber with Dipali Basak, a speech-and-hearing-impaired woman allegedly raped by a CPM man. Late that night, Mamata was arrested.        
	The same year, on July 21, police firing at Esplanade killed 13 Youth Congress activists as the organisation, led by Mamata, geared up for a march to Writers to protest against the states law-and-order situation.        
	We all remember how Basu used to belittle Didi when she was shaping up as a leader. But today we would like to put the bitterness behind us when the entire country is mourning Basus death, a Trinamul vice-president said.        
	He felt that Basus absence would help Trinamul corner the CPM more forcefully. After his death, the CPM has no guardian left, he said.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said: For the next three days, we shall not line up any political programme; but there would be no let-up in our anti-government agitation after that, he said.        
	Farewell decision        
	Mamata will decide the place for paying her last respects to Basu after the CPM informs her about the farewell programme.         
	We shall inform the railway minister where she would come to place wreaths on Tuesday. She might come to the Assembly where Basus body will be kept between 11am and 3pm, said CPM leader Rabin Deb.         
	A Trinamul general secretary said Mamata would meet her aides tomorrow to discuss her schedule on Tuesday.

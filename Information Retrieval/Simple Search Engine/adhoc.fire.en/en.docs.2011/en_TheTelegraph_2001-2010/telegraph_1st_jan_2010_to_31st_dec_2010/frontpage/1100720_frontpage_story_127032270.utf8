										                                        The caracas of the Vananchal Express. Who is responsible- a topic to debate in the WB Assembly. A Telegraph picture.      
	Kolkata, Jul 20 (PTI): The Sainthia train accident rocked the West Bengal Assembly for the second day today with Left Front members demanding the resignation of Railway Minister, and Trinamool Congress accusing the Speaker of misusing the House for political purposes.  
	Left Front demands Mamata's resignation  
	RSP member Tapan Hore said the Railways was trying to wash its hands off yesterday's accident with the Railway Board Chairman holding the driver of the Uttarbanga Express, which rammed into the Vananchal Express, responsible.  
	Claiming that neither Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee nor the Railway Board had discharged their responsibilities, he demanded that the Minister should resign owning moral responsibility for the accident.  
	 Senior CPI(M) member Rabin Mondol said that 15 train accidents had taken place in the country in the past one year.When the Railway Minister had visited Sainthia station yesterday, Mondol said, the people had raised slogans demanding her resignation.  
	Trinamool fights back  
	Trinamool Congress members strongly protested this and alleged that the House was being used for political purposes to criticise the Railway Minister.Leader of the Opposition, Partha Chatterjee alleged that the CPI(M) was bent on politicising the accident in which many people had lost their lives.   
	Subsequently, both the Trinamool Congress and Congress MLAs walked out from the House. 	Earlier, Congress leader in the Assembly, Manas Bhunia accused Hore of launching a political attack against the Railway Minister and described it as unfortunate.   
	If the Railway Minister was to resign for the accident would the chief minister and Transport minister resign for road accidents which claimed many lives, he asked. 	Bhunia demanded an inquiry at the highest level into the accident in Sainthia.  
	Later, Trinamool Congress members shouted slogans in the Assembly lobby against the Speaker ldquo;for allowing the House to be used for political purposes rdquo;. 	Chatterjee accused the Speaker of acting at the behest of the CPI(M). ldquo;It is amazing that the train accident issue was discussed again after the House observed silence in memory of those killed. rdquo;

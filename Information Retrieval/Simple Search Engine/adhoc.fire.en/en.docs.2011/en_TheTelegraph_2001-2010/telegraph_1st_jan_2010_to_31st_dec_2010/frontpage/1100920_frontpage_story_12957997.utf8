The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Eight on death row, none to pull the rope
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Eight on death row, none to pull the rope
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                            The late Nata Mullick with his grandson Prabhat in 2004.                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 19: Wanted, a hangman.        
	Take a loan from Bengal.        
	With eight inmates of Tihar Jail on death row, Bengal is the only hope for Asias biggest prison. Its the only state where a hangman is on the governments payroll.        
	No other state has a professional hangman.        
	Tihar law officer Sunil Gupta said Bengal was the only option if any of the appeals filed by the condemned prisoners was thrown out.         
	Among the eight sentenced to death is Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, whose mercy plea is pending with the President. Most of the others have appealed to the Supreme Court.         
	If the mercy petition of Afzal Guru is rejected and the petitions of some of the other prisoners are quashed by the Supreme Court, we will approach the Bengal government to provide us the only hangman available in India, Gupta said.         
	The sought-after hangman is Prabhat Mullick, the grandson of the countrys last hangman Nata Mullick.         
	Of course, the 27-year-old cant say yet that he has strung anybody up, but he has learnt the tricks of the trade from his late grandfather who executed rapist-murderer Dhananjay Chatterjee, the last man to be hanged in the country.        
	Prabhat had assisted his grandfather in that hanging in August 2004. Since then, he has carried out mock hangings with sandbags, just to be in touch.        
	Sources in Bengal said Prabhat got the job as part of a deal his grandfather struck before Dhananjays execution.         
	Hangmen dont get a regular salary and are paid only Rs 500 for every execution. Nata, then 83 and a veteran of 24 hangings, had asked the Bengal government for a job and monthly stipend for his son. He had also met the jail minister.        
	In 2006, the state government appointed Prabhat as a sweeper. The hangmans job came earlier this year, after his grandfathers death in 2009.        
	We have appointed him as a sweeper-cum-hangman. He has got all the training to be a hangman and also learnt the tricks of the trade during Dhananjay Chatterjees hanging in 2004, Bengal additional director-general (prisons) B.D. Sharma told The Telegraph from Calcutta.        
	The hangman tag means Prabhat is the third-generation executioner in his family. His great grandfather Shibal was a hangman during the British era.        
	With no hangings since 2004, Prabhats only job has been that of in-charge of cleaning at Alipore Central Jail. But he does carry out mock hangings with the help of sandbags to hone his skills, Sharma said.         
	Gupta said the last time anybody was hanged in Tihar was in 1989 when Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, convicted of assassinating Indira Gandhi, were executed by two hangmen, Kallu and Fakira.         
	Kallu was from Uttar Pradesh and Fakira was brought from Punjab. Both died a few years ago, he said.        
	All the other hangmen in the country, the Tihar law officer added, have either died or have retired.        
	Gupta said the government pays just Rs 500 for a hanging, and nobody was interested in the paltry sum. Plus, a hangmans job is not a full-time profession, he added.        
	A senior official at Tihar said the jail has never had a hangman on its payroll. It sends a negative signal. And now when we are carrying out reforms in jails, it will look strange to have a full-time hangman.        
	But what if even one of the appeals pending before the President or the apex court is thrown out?        
	Only Bengal can bail the jail out. Got the hang of it?

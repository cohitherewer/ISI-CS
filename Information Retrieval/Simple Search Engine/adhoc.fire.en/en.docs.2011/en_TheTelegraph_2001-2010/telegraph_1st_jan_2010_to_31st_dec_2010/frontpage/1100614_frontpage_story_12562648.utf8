          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, June 13: The police have arrested two extremists, including a Maoist guerrilla who was a member of the five-member rebel squad that pulled off the kidnap and execution of special branch inspector Francis Indwar last year.        
	Lakshmi Munda was arrested last night from an area between Dassam Falls and Taimara, about 20km from the district police headquarters under Bundu police station area.         
	He was carrying 4.5kg explosives, which he was to deliver to fellow Maoist Santosh Munda, the leader of the squad behind Indwars audacious abduction and killing that made national headlines during September-October, 2009.        
	According to SSP Praveen Kumar, Lakshmi was a resident of Kera village of Arki in Khunti district. Known to be an expert in explosives, he has been an active Maoist guerrilla for several years.         
	The high-power gel recovered from Lakshmi was being taken to prepare a can bomb by mixing it with chemical fertilisers and ammonium nitrate. The quantity of explosives recovered from him is sufficient to prepare a 40-kg can bomb which can easily blow up an anti-landmine vehicles used by police, he said.         
	Lakshmis is the second arrest in connection with Indwars murder. Budhram Lohra, alias Pawan Munda, was the first. He too is an expert in explosives. The police are on the lookout for the other three: Santosh Munda, Parikshit Jee and Sokha Jee.         
	Indwar was abducted on September 30 last year and his beheaded body was recovered on the road near Raisa More at Namkum in Ranchi district on October 6. All political parties condemned the kidnap and brutal killing and the Maoists too earned a bad name among their sympathisers.        
	Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who visited the state to campaign for his party, made an unscheduled stopover at Indwars home on October 16 last year and met his family to express his condolences.        
	The second extremist to be arrested was sub-zonal commander of Tritiya Prastuti Committee (TPC) Ashok Ganjhu, alias Vishu Jee. He was arrested last night while he was on his way to collect levy from a residential area in Khelari.         
	A resident of Salchanwa of Balumath in Latehar, Ganjhu was the founder member of the organisation, said Kumar.         
	The police have been looking for him for long. Ganjhu allegedly killed Sangharsh Janmukti member Balgovind Yadav after an encounter recently. He was also behind the stoppage of coal transportation to CCLs Piparwar area apparently due to a dispute over levy with local transporters.        
	Kumar said an SUV seized from him (JH01 AA 8611) was bought spending levy money and was used by the TPC.

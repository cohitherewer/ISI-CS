The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Love a great party?   Then pray for hosts
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Love a great party?   Then pray for hosts
  - Sense of relief in Johannesburg as the big day dawns          KEIR RADNEDGE                                                    
	At last, at very long last, it is time for an end to fine words and a start to fine football. The 2010 World Cup, most contentiously awarded and most eagerly awaited, is about to begin.        
	This is good news for the African continent, good news for the pressured players of the impatient hosts South Africa and their wary Mexican opponents, good news for South Africa itself and, above all, good news for the world game.        
	Also, this opening match in the vast yet claustrophobic Soccer City stadium here in Johannesburg spells relief.        
	This is a sentiment born of an acknowledgement that the organisers are more or less ready to host the greatest event in global sport, relief at escaping unscathed from last-minute crises such as last weekends stadium stampede at the Nigeria-North Korea friendly, for example, at which 14 people were injured but no-ne died.        
	Fifa president Sepp Blatter, doubtless, can hardly wait to step out in public before the historic kickoff.        
	South Africa is one country where he is hailed as a heroic figure and cheered to a decibel degree matching an orchestra of vuvuzela trumpets; this is far from the more cynical and critical receptions which Blatter receives back in Europe.        
	To his credit, he has been a persistent champion of the cause of an African World Cup and, had he had his way, South Africa and not Germany would have been the host nation in 2006.        
	In one way, defeat sparked by the controversial flight from the vote of New Zealand veteran Charlie Dempsey was good news for South Africa. Danny Jordaan, the organising CEO who has been a tireless ambassador for the cause, has conceded that the country benefited from an extra four years to prepare and evolve.        
	This is not to say the wait has not been counter-productive in some ways: the global recession has cut estimates of likely football tourists from 500,000 to a more realistic 350,000.        
	Distance, for European fans, had lent an expensive aura of intimidation to the prospect of travelling so far south in the present economic climate.        
	Fifa says that ticket sales have currently hit 97 per cent, approximately the same as four years ago. Will the finals prove as much of a party as four years ago? Hopefully they may but much depends on the hosts.        
	There will be fewer foreign fans to party in their own styles; so more than ever the popular wave of support will rest with home, i.e. South African, fans.        
	This is one reason why it is crucial that the host team progresses at least to the second round.        
	Host momentum is crucial to the spiritual success of a tournament: this is why it is worrying that the other African nations  any one of which might pick up the continents banner should the hosts fall early  are bereft of senior players.        
	No Essien with Ghana, no Mikel Obi with Nigeria and only a half-fit Didier Drogba to lead Ivory Coast.        
	Other imponderables include the fatigue factor after a long European season which may take its toll on both the overall quality of the football and on important individuals such as Leo Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Fernando Torres, Steven Gerrard and their like.        
	Football, sometimes defined as a new religion of the masses, needs its demi-gods to worship, admire and emulate. All lovers of the great game can certainly look forward to drama and surprise. Hopefully, the 2010 World Cup will also present honest competition, mighty endeavour and, above all, great inspiration.        
	A heavy responsibility indeed for all involved. But where better to pursue that metaphorical  and literal  pot of gold than in Nelson Mandelas land of the Rainbow Nation?

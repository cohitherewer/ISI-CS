	June 14: The US has discovered nearly $1 trillion in untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan, far beyond any previously known reserves and enough to fundamentally alter the Afghan economy and perhaps the war itself, according to American officials.        
	The value of the newly discovered mineral deposits dwarfs the size of Afghanistans existing, war-bedraggled economy with a gross domestic product of about $12 billion. The estimated value of the deposits almost matches Indias GDP of $1.2 trillion.        
	The discovery adds a stunning economic dimension to the Great Game, a strategic joust straddling centuries. India is also part of the ongoing Great Game but does not have much of a presence in mining in Afghanistan now. Locational disadvantages, too, stand in the way of India exploiting the sector, unless Iran offers passage.        
	At the same time, American officials fear a resource-hungry China will try to dominate the development of Afghanistans mineral wealth.        
	The previously unknown deposits  including huge veins of iron, copper, cobalt, gold and critical industrial metals like lithium  are so big and include so many minerals that are essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could eventually be transformed into one of the most important mining centres in the world, the US officials believe.        
	An internal Pentagon memo, for example, states that Afghanistan could become the Saudi Arabia of lithium, a key raw material in the manufacture of batteries for laptops and BlackBerrys.         
	The vast scale of Afghanistans mineral wealth was discovered by a small team of Pentagon officials and American geologists.         
	While it could take many years to develop a mining industry, the potential is so great that officials believe it could attract heavy investment even before the mines are profitable, providing the possibility of jobs that could distract from generations of war.        
	There is stunning potential here, Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander of the US Central Command, said. There are a lot of ifs, of course, but I think potentially it is hugely significant.        
	The mineral deposits are scattered throughout the country.        
	American and Afghan officials agreed to discuss the mineral discoveries at a difficult moment in the Afghanistan war. The American-led offensive in Marja in southern Afghanistan has achieved only limited gains.        
	Charges of corruption and favouritism continue to plague the Hamid Karzai government, and Karzai seems increasingly embittered towards the White House.        
	So the Obama administration is hungry for some positive news. Yet, the American officials also recognise that the mineral discoveries will almost certainly have a double-edged impact.        
	Instead of bringing peace, the mineral wealth could lead the Taliban to battle even more fiercely to regain control.         
	The corruption that is already rampant in the Karzai government could also be amplified by the new wealth, particularly if a handful of well-connected oligarchs gain control of the resources.        
	With virtually no mining industry or infrastructure in place today, it will take decades for Afghanistan to exploit its mineral wealth fully.

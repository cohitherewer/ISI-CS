	Midnapore (WB) June 16 (PTI): In a major crackdown on Maoists, security forces killed eight Naxals, including three women, in an encounter at a forest in West Midnapore district early today.
    After getting a tip-off that a group of 22 Maoists had taken shelter in Ranja forest near Duli village in the Salboni police station area, the joint forces, comprising the CRPF, BSF, COBRA and state police, raided the area, West Midnapore District Magistrate N S Nigam said.
    Nigam said the Maoists first opened fire and the forces retaliated, killing the eight Maoists including three women. All eight bodies had been recovered, but were yet to be identified.
    The entire area from Bhadutala to Pirakata in Salboni along the forest has been declared off limits to people and vehicles following the encounter.

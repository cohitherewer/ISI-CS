  - Capital of plumbers gets a school to hone skills          MANOJ KAR AND ASHUTOSH MISHRA                                                     
	Kendrapara, Oct. 27: If Bob the Builder and his fix-it friends were to land in India now, no place would make them prouder than Pattamundai.        
	Patta what?        
	Yes, Pattamundai, Indias capital of plumbers, where a school dedicated to chiselling a nut-and-bolt skill without which no modern home can function was inaugurated today.        
	Its not clear yet whether Bobs catchphrase Can we fix it? and the full-throated riposte Yes, we can! (yes, countless children know Barack Obama did not coin it) will be made the anthem of the Orissa institute.        
	But the animation gangs spirit of crisis management is not alien to the Rajnagar-Pattamundai-Aul belt of Kendrapara where more people opt for plumbing to make a living than in any other part of the country.        
	Chances are your neighbourhood plumber is also from the same belt or he will know someone from the region. The metros, including Calcutta, now boast around 20,000 plumbers hailing from the Orissa triumvirate.        
	The school  obviously named without Bobs flair and called the very official State Institute of Plumbing Technology (SIPT)  is the only one in the state (possibly in the country, too) dedicated to plumbing. Other technical institutes do teach the skill but offer it as one among many other courses.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who inaugurated the Rs 5.25-crore institute spread on 3.48 acres today, said: The plumbers of Kendrapara have made their presence felt throughout the country with their skill and hard work. The state government has decided to hone their skills further.        
	The belt, which falls in a no-industry district, took to the trade several years ago when a couple of plumbers from Pattamundai went to Delhi to try their luck. As their reputation grew and remittances trickled in, friends and relatives followed in their footsteps.                           
	Take the case of Nakul Charan Swain, a plumber from Rajnagar, who migrated to Delhi in 1983. He earned a daily wage of Rs 9, which was higher than what he made in his village. Within three months, he graduated from a master plumbers helper to a mistry, earning Rs 11 a day.        
	Aged 50 now, Swain is a flourishing contractor who employs 15 to 20 plumbers and masons. He owns a flat in Delhis Dilshad Garden, besides a pucca house in his village, and his son is doing his MBA in Bhubaneswar.         
	Some chose the more lucrative option of going overseas to Iran and Iraq to ply their trade.        
	The principal of the institute, Bibhuti Bhusan Nayak, said the national council for vocational training had approved 21 seats for a single plumbing unit course at the new institute. All the seats have been filled; so the institute has asked for an additional 126 seats.         
	The 12-month course charges general candidates Rs 2,300 and scheduled caste and scheduled tribe students Rs 1.300. The tools of the trade cost around Rs 1,250. Once they are done, the students can earn between Rs 200 and Rs 250 a day initially and Rs 300-350 after a while.        
	 My father has established himself in the plumbing trade in Surat. He has been there for the last 20 years. I did my matriculation this year and have joined the plumbing course at the institute on my fathers advice, said Prasanta Mallick from Srirampur village.         
	Amulya Dalei from Belatala village near Pattamundai echoed the same feelings. My father is based in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh. I will join him there after completing the course, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nitish slap greets   ad-happy Modi 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Nitish slap greets   ad-happy Modi 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND NALIN VERMA                                    
	Patna, June 12: Nitish Kumar today virtually told Narendra Modi he was unwanted in Bihar, handing out the public rebuff to reassert his secular credentials after suggestions that he was warming up to the Gujarat chief minister.        
	The excuse for the snub, delivered at a media lunch Nitish hosted, had been provided by Modi himself this morning in the shape of patronising newspaper ads that touted him as a role model for the Bihar chief minister.        
	The last thing I want is to be seen in Modis company, Nitish told journalists. He dubbed one of the Modi ads uncultured, unethical.         
	Asked if he expected Modi to attend the dinner for BJP leaders at his home tonight, he said he had not asked anyone to come personally. The BJP took the hint and declined the invite.        
	Modi is not known to swallow insults, but the BJP said he would stay to address tomorrows Patna rally, to be held on the sidelines of the partys national executive meeting.        
	The newspaper ads were taken out in the name of private Bihar citizens, but BJP sources said the Gujarat government had funded them, although the Modi administration later denied this.        
	One of the ads showed Modi holding Nitishs arms aloft in solidarity. The picture was taken a year ago at an NDA rally in Ludhiana, where Nitish had been left squirming as Modi ambushed him by grabbing his arm.        
	The ad said:  Gujarat has become a role model for others. The Biharis settled in Gujarat are forever grateful to Narendra Modi for his deeds and hope that Bihar will repeat the magic he has worked in Gujarat.        
	Nitish made it plain that Modi had no business telling him how to run Bihar. What has Modi got to do with it? Bihar is not a weakling. We Biharis have strength to confront the toughest challenge.        
	Another ad praised Modi for the help he had given to Bihar during the 2008 Kosi floods. Nitish said: (In) Bharatiya culture and Bihar culture it is uncultured, unethical and bad manners to make a production of how much help one gives.        
	He later told The Telegraph he planned to return the Rs 5 crore Gujarat had given Bihar as flood aid.        
	Nitish began showcasing his secular credentials right from morning, offering a chadar at Pir Ali Khanquah in the Phulwari Sharief dargah, where he was photographed with leading Muslim clerics. An aide said having these pictures on the front pages of newspapers was the only way to counter the damage caused by Modis campaign.

	New Delhi, Dec. 2: Scientists have discovered a microbe that can feed on arsenic and accept this toxic element in its proteins and genetic material, challenging long-standing ideas about the chemical recipes for life.         
	US biologists today announced that they had extracted from a lake-bed in eastern California a never-before-observed bacterium that uses arsenic as a substitute for phosphorus, a key element found in all living organisms.         
	This is fascinating, said Milind Watve, an evolutionary biologist at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, who was not associated with the research. It strikes at a core assumption about the uniformity of the chemistry of life. And it shows that the microbial world may be more diverse than we had imagined, Watve told The Telegraph.         
	Some scientists are speculating that such arsenic-eating bacteria may be used in future  if proven safe and economical  to combat the arsenic contamination of groundwater, widespread in Bengal and Bangladesh.         
	Nearly two centuries of observations have suggested that six elements  carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur  make up the bulk of proteins, genetic material and fats in all life forms on Earth from bacteria to earthworms to humans. Organisms also depend on other elements such as zinc or iron, but only in tiny amounts.         
	Now, biologist Felisa Wolfe-Simon at the Nasa Astrobiology Institute and her colleagues have found a bacterium that can replace phosphorus with arsenic in its proteins and nucleic acids or DNA. A paper on the bacterium will appear in the journal Science tomorrow.         
	The researchers isolated bacteria from the mud of Mono Lake in eastern California which has a high concentration of arsenic.         
	In the laboratory, the scientists grew some of these bacterial species on a diet rich in arsenic but poor in phosphorus. A bacterium, assigned the name GFAJ-1, displayed its capacity to shift to arsenic.         
	If something here on Earth can do something so unexpected, what else can life do that we havent seen yet? Wolfe-Simon said in a statement issued through the Arizona State University (ASU) where she was a researcher earlier.         
	This organism has a dual capability. It can grow with phosphorus or arsenic, said Paul Davies, a team member and astrobiologist at the ASU. That makes it very peculiar, though it falls short of being some form of truly alien life.         
	Davies had earlier speculated that microbes with strange capabilities might exist on Earth. Wolfe-Simon had specifically raised the possibility that microbes might be able to replace phosphorus with arsenic.         
	This is exciting because phosphorus is a crucial element for key processes that occur inside living cells, said Sisinthy Shivaji, a senior scientist at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad.         
	We now have to ask how these processes occur with arsenic in place of phosphorus, said Shivaji, who five years ago had discovered two species of arsenic-resistant bacteria in groundwater from Chakdah district in Bengal.         
	How arsenic infiltrates bio-molecules, and the mechanisms through which such molecules operate, remain unknown, the US researchers have said in their paper.         
	Such microbes are certainly interesting for basic biology, but arsenic clean-up is a possible application that comes to mind, said Vidyanand Nanjundiah, an evolutionary biologist at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.        
	Ill only be speculating for now, but if such a microbe can be grown easily and if it is safe, it could be used in bio-filters to remove arsenic from contaminated groundwater, Nanjundiah said.

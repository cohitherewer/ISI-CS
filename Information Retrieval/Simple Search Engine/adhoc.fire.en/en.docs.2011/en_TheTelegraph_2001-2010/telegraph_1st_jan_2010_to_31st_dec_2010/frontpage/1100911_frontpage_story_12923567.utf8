  - Om Puri stars as Pakistani immigrant trying to cope with unruly children           AMIT ROY                             Om Puri in West is West                                        
	London, Sept. 10: Those on the lookout for the next big Asian film after Slumdog Millionaire are keeping a close watch on West is West, starring Om Puri.        
	The film is a sequel to East is East, which stars Puri as Pakistani immigrant George Khan trying to bring up a brood of unruly children in Salford in Manchester.         
	West is West, which is due to have its first public screening at the Toronto Film Festival on September 12, recently held a private cast and crew screening at Bafta in Piccadilly in London.        
	Toronto was where the buzz about Slumdog Millionaire first began before the positive word of mouth was confirmed at the London Film Festival. Slumdog went on to pick up eight Oscars last year. Leslee Udwin, who has produced both East and West, said: West is West is better.         
	Om Puris George Khan is a Pakistani immigrant who returns to his native village for the first time in 30 years since he left for Salford, took an English wife, Ella, had six children with her, and more or less forgot (the unnamed) wife number one and the two daughters he had left behind.         
	This time he turns up with Sajid, his stroppy son whose manners have not improved since audiences left him and his dad in East is East.               
	Five years have passed, it is now 1976 and Sajid is dragged off to Pakistan by his father who is determined to force some good old-fashioned Pakistani culture into his delinquent son.                   Aquib Khan as Sajid Khan       
	It is a coming of age film for both George and Sajid, explained Udwin.         
	Another of Georges sons, Maneer (Emil Marwa), is already there, looking unsuccessfully for a bride. What he does not know is Neelam Haaq (Zita Sattar) from Rochdale is also out there hunting, it so happens, for a husband.               
	Since Ayub Khan Din has done the script, viewers can be confident the story is handled sensitively  he is widely regarded as one of the best playwrights in Britain.         
	His stage version of East is East in 1996 was seen by Udwin who immediately bought the film rights. The film was released in 1999. For three decades, George  real name Jahangir  had considered himself a real Pakistani. Now he finds he is treated virtually as a foreigner in West is West.         
	Georges tale is that of thousands of Pakistanis who came to Britain and created a new life, leaving behind a parallel world back home.         
	Who are you  George or Jahangir? the unnamed Wife No. 1 (Ila Arun) asks him in possibly the most profound question posed in the film.         
	Disturbed by his prolonged stay in Pakistan, Wife No. 2, Ella (Linda Bassett), turns up from Salford. One sequence, when Wives One and Two try to communicate with each other without a common language, was possibly the most moving part of the film.         
	For security and other reasons, the film was shot in India in and around Chandigarh.         
	West is West is positive about Pakistan without being preachy about Islam. For test audiences who have seen the film, it is the best kind of movie  it is culturally specific but transcends the culture in which it is set.         
	Directed by Andy DeEmmony and funded by BBC Films and the UK Film Council, the buzz has already started on whether Om Puri deserves an Oscar.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Now, CBI on Koda petitioners tail
          OUR BUREAU                                        Madhu Koda      
	Ranchi, Aug. 31: The CBI has been put on the trail of Madhu Kodas elusive bete noire, one Durga Oraon, whose PIL seeking a probe by the central agency into the former chief ministers unaccounted-for-wealth, led to ongoing investigations by the vigilance bureau, and later, the income tax department.        
	Oraon has never appeared in court ever since his counsel, Ritu Kumar, filed the PIL on his behalf in September 2008, citing security concerns.         
	While hearings have gone on for the last two years, recently on August 16, Oraons counsel produced a letter wherein the petitioner sought exemption from appearance and once again cited a threat to his life.         
	While Koda and some of his former cabinet colleagues  Harinarayan Rai, Anosh Ekka, Dulal Bhuiyan, Chandra Prakash Choudhary, Kamlesh Singh, Bhanu Pratap Sahi and Bandhu Tirkey  became the subject of a much publicised probe, questions began to be raised on the veracity of the person behind the PIL, some even claiming it was a motivated move by political opponents.        
	While hearing the case today, a division bench of Chief Justice Bhagwati Prasad and Justice Sushil Harkauli observed that since investigations into the disproportionate assets case concerning Koda and his former colleagues had been handed over to CBI, the agency could also be assigned the task of tracing Oraon.        
	Kumar said her client had not spoken to her since March 2010. But, I received a letter from him which I produced in the court on August 16, she said, adding she would co-operate with the CBI in tracing Oraon.         
	Under rules, a client can be in touch with his/her lawyer or withdraw the vakalatnama, which empowers the lawyer to fight the case on his/her behalf. But in this case, he is neither in touch with me nor withdrawn his vakalatnama, she told The Telegraph.         
	During the August 16 hearing, the court directed DGP Neyaz Ahmed to ensure Oraon was presented in court today. In an affidavit filed today to explain the polices failure to trace him, the DGP said that Oraons claim of having a Morabadi address proved to be false.        
	The police also checked voters lists of Kanke, Hatia and Ranchi constituencies, but found no person by that name.                                                               
	They have also tracked Oraon in Simdega but reached a dead end. All police stations in the district had been told to inform the headquarters if they received any information about Oraon, Ahmed said in his affidavit.        
	Koda, who was given permission by the court to attend the monsoon session of Parliament, was arrested by the vigilance bureau on November 30 last year. Four of his former cabinet colleagues are also in jail.        
	 The CBI recently took over investigations into his disproportionate assets, estimated by income tax authorities to be around Rs 1,500 crore, from the vigilance bureau in pursuance of the court order.         
	The Enforcement Directorate is also investigating the case under the Money Laundering Act.         
	The vigilance bureau yesterday lodged another case against him along with 28 others for causing loss to the state through manipulation of tenders relating to rural electrification projects in Jharkhand..

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Munda push for probe into National Games 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Munda push for probe into National Games 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                             National Games complex in Hotwar                                  
	Ranchi, Sept. 23: At a time when controversies are threatening the very fate of the Delhi Commonwealth Games, barely 10 days away, the spotlight is back on the much-postponed 34th National Games to be hosted by Jharkhand, which has also run into rough weather following allegations of financial irregularities.         
	Chief minister Arjun Munda stepped in today, asking the sports department to immediately approach the vigilance bureau and request it to complete the probe into the allegations clouding the National Games, slated between December 9 and 22 after five postponements.         
	He maintained that the Jharkhand government was committed to holding the sporting event and appropriate actions would be taken against the guilty on the basis of the vigilance report.        
	Munda passed these orders while reviewing the current status of preparations for the Games. He also sought the Principal Accountant Generals (PAG) reports that cited financial impropriety in the purchase of sports equipment and finalisation of tenders for various services, and unwarranted expenses by the National Games Organising Committee (NGOC).        
	The state government had ordered the vigilance probe on the basis of the PAG report. This apart, the CBI is also probing a disproportionate assets case against former sports minister Bandhu Tirkey.         
	The hindrances that these probes caused the Games preparation process also figured during the discussion. The chief minister has given certain directions to clear the hurdles, said chief secretary A.K. Singh.        
	Munda was shocked to learn that the venue for the equestrian event was yet to be decided. Terraflex for volleyball and basketball indoor stadiums are also not ready while construction of approach roads is awaited.         
	According to sources, over Rs 600 crore has so far been spent on infrastructure development for National Games. Another Rs 275 crore has been made available to NGOC to purchase equipment. Of this, over Rs 125 crore is lying unused.         
	Munda, however, stressed that his government would make all efforts to hold the Games on time. Today, I took stock of the current status. I dont want to indulge in a blame game. I have directed officials to work out alternatives to plug the loopholes.

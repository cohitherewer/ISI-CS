          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, Aug. 2: Suspected militants ransacked the office of the prosecution inspectors branch, which is housed in the same building as that of East Garo Hills deputy commissioner, and looted an unspecified number of sophisticated small arms this morning.         
	Meghalaya director-general of police S.B. Kakati said he had been informed about the crime and the matter was being investigated by the police in Williamnagar, the headquarters of East Garo Hills, located 300km from here.        
	A senior police official today said they suspected the involvement of the Garo hills-based nascent militant outfit, Garo National Liberation Army, led by Champion Sangma, who held the rank of deputy superintendent of police before deserting the forces. He said the GNLA might have carried out the attack with the help of local goons.         
	The police are not ruling out the involvement of other militant outfits like the Liberation of Achik Elite Force. But their primary suspect is the GNLA as it has a stronghold in Garo hills and Sangma knows the police armoury and the places the arms are stored with the East Garo Hills district administration.        
	The police said the administration got information about the robbery around 6am but the incident must have taken place much before that  either in the wee hours or last night.        
	Preliminary investigations revealed that the militants broke open the gate of the pathway leading to the PIBs ground floor room where the arms were kept. They broke the lock of the room and those of some almirahs inside it and looted the weapons.         
	The police said they were yet to know the number of small arms taken away by the militants.         
	We dont know the quantity of the small arms stolen but know that they were sophisticated, an official with the East Garo Hills deputy commissioners office said, adding that the weapons were of Russian and Chinese make.         
	Arms seized from militants and goons after their arrest are temporarily stored in the PIB office before being produced in court.        
	The night chowkidar confessed during interrogation that he was absent from duty during the incident.        
	A police official said though the incident took place in the morning, East Garo Hills police waited till late in the evening for the arrival of a dog squad and fingerprint experts from Shillong before entering the scene of crime. In the meantime, they cordoned off the PIB office.         
	The police are also examining the role of insiders in the office of the deputy commissioner in providing information about the small arms to the militants.         
	Police sources said the force had launched operations against the GNLA militants in several remote villages of the district for the past few days and the militants could have made the daring act taking advantage of the thin police presence in the headquarters.         
	The police are thinking of providing adequate security to the offices of the deputy commissioners of East and South Garo Hills, where the GNLA militants operate, to prevent any such incident in the future.

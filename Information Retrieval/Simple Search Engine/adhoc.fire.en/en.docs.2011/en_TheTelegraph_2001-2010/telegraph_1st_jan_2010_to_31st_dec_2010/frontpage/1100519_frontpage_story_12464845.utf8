          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, May 18: The Congress is determined not to allow air power in combating the Maoists but several party leaders were today concentrating their firepower on P. Chidambarams disclosure of his efforts to get his limited mandate enlarged.        
	Although shaken by the second major strike in Dantewada, the party is sticking to its broad vision of a cautious, sensitive and holistic approach to the Naxalite problem.        
	The party has not given any formal response to the demand from some quarters for the use of air power and the army, but senior leaders ruled out the option.        
	We dont think even the government is thinking of it. We cant bomb villages and forests. We dont want the Maoist movement to turn into tribal insurgency, a senior leader said.        
	Home minister Chidambarams reference to the limited mandate during a television interview has created much unease in the Congress. Many in the party feel that a member of the cabinet committee on security should not reveal what transpired at a meeting.        
	Although no one is willing so far to speak on record, given Chidambarams clout and the sensitivity of the matter, murmurs about the senior ministers indiscretion are doing the round in party circles.        
	I took to the cabinet committee (the) case for a larger mandate, I was given a limited mandate. I will go back to the cabinet committee, I have already spoken to the Prime Minister..., Chidambaram had told NDTV last night.        
	Some Congress leaders feel that, apart from touching upon cabinet deliberations, Chidambaram had given the BJP fresh ammunition to attack the government by creating an impression that his hands were tied. One leader said: He offered to resign after the first Dantewada attack, taking the whole responsibility upon himself and thus the Centre, leaving the BJP guilt-free. Now he gives the BJP an escape route by revealing that the cabinet did not grant him what he wanted.         
	Most leaders feel that a senior cabinet minister should not get emotional on such crucial occasions and go to the media with a sense of injured innocence. An important AICC functionary said: The BJP was taking shelter behind our mistakes  be it the perceived differences or one-upmanship among certain leaders  whereas the state government had completely failed in its duty.         
	He said the spurt in Maoist violence in Chhattisgarh was also a manifestation of bungling by the state government for a long period, including a phase between December 2007 and April 2009 when allegations of tacit understanding between Maoists and the BJP were levelled. But the Congress spokespersons avoided attacking the state government, saying that the time was not ripe for a blame game.        
	But Congress leader Digvijay Singh said the state government had completely failed in its duty to protect the people. We are losing out because the state government vacated 800 villages on its own. You will obviously not get intelligence from the locals. We talk of the Andhra model, and that cannot happen until you win over the local people.         
	Digvijay, whose article in a newspaper has given the impression that the Congress is a divided house on tackling the Maoists, iterated the need for a multi-pronged strategy and stressed that development could go hand in hand with police operations.         
	Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, too, made a scathing attack on the Raman Singh government which apparently is on the same page with the Union home ministry. He told The Telegraph: No lessons were learnt from the earlier tragedy. Now the chief minister talks of new policy. Isnt that an admission that he was pursuing wrong policies so far?        
	Jogi, recalling what my leader Sonia Gandhi said, pointed out: Without development, you cannot win this war. Only after winning peoples trust you will get pinpointed information on Maoists movement.

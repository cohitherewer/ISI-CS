	New Delhi, Feb. 26: Tax breaks proposed in Budget 2010-11 for makers of mobile phone accessories is likely to see increased local production of not just cell phones but also key accessories and handset components.         
	Mobile phone makers such as Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson and their suppliers will gain from the extension of the benefit of 4 per cent special additional duty exemption on mobile phone parts, components and accessories till March 31, 2011, from the June 2010 deadlines.         
	The exemption of the three key accessories  battery packs, chargers and hands-free headphones  from basic duty, countervailing duty and special additional duty will see mass production of mobile phones in India.         
	Major players such as Nokia, LG, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Motorola would source these items from the country, encouraging a new local manufacturing eco-system for such items, industry players said.        
	To encourage domestic manufacturing of accessories, these exemptions are now being extended to parts of battery chargers and hands-free headphones, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said.        
	The move (exemption of special additional duty on accessories) will help bring more investment in the area and encourage domestic manufacture. We believe these moves are extremely encouraging, and will help catalyse Indias emergence as a global telecom manufacturing hub, said Ambrish Bakaya, director (corporate affairs), Nokia India.         
	The duty relief will simplify the import process and facilitate better cash flow into the industry.        
	As many as 70 million mobiles that hit the domestic market every year are imported. Handset makers are pleased, especially on account of the exemption of 4 per cent special additional duty, which was resulting in working capital blockage. Such exemption signals the governments renewed focus on manufacturing the mobile phone, and now also its parts, components and accessories, said Pankaj Mohindroo, national president, Indian Cellular Association.                                      
	The dispensation to exempt the manufacturers of mobile phone battery packs, chargers and hands-free headphones from custom duty will also encourage the likes of Nokia, LG, Samsung, Sony-Ericsson to Motorola to source such items from India. That, in turn, will create a whole new local manufacturing eco-system at the spares, accessories, components level, as pave the way for their mass local production, he added.

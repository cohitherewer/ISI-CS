  - Dog keeps jumbo waiting          R. SURYAMURTHY                      The dog on the runway                                
	July 15: Big boy, dont mess with this underdog.        
	The worlds largest commercial aircraft flew into its David-and-Goliath moment when an Airbus A380 of Emirates landed in Delhi to a water-cannon shower welcome this afternoon.        
	On the tarmac, already drenched by rain, was a slippery customer, darting about with a catch-me-if-you-can smirk at the biggest bird of the skies. The four-footed mongrel and the centipede-wheeled mammoth sized each other up for a few minutes.        
	The behemoth blinked first.         
	The managers of the plane and the airport decided it was prudent to wait out the dog than taxi towards the aerobridge duct and risk an ill-omened mishap on first day, first show.        
	For nearly 30 minutes, the plane had to squat immobile on the tarmac before clearance was given to advance towards the bridge. By then, the dog had disappeared.        
	This is not the first time humbler creatures have thrown their weight around the high and mighty that come calling at Delhi airport.                           
	But few expected this dog to have his day the moment the first commercial A380 flight of a foreign airline landed in Terminal 3 (T3) of Indira Gandhi International Airport.        
	If the plane was having its own version of a dog day afternoon, those inside had little clue about the battle of unequals outside. Only after getting off did most of the 500-plus passengers understand why they had to be on their feet for 30 minutes after a journey that did not give any cause for complaint about legroom.        
	The three-and-a-half hour flight from Dubai seemed short as the seat-cum-bed, in-flight entertainment, bar and lounge, shower spas and stairs to the first class and business sections added to creature comforts.        
	However, passengers planning to fly the jumbo aircraft will have to wait till at least the middle of next year for Emirates to start commercial operations. Todays was a stand-alone flight.        
	The 517-seat aircraft offers 14 flat-bed first class private suites with electric doors, 76 fully-flat seats in business class and 427 contoured seats in economy spread across four roomy cabins on the lower deck.        
	It has over 5,000 square feet of space, almost 50 per cent more than that of the next largest aircraft, the Boeing 747-400. First and business class seats fill the upper cabin, sparing room for a bar at the rear with some seats strategically placed around the watering hole.        
	The seats stretch long enough for most passengers to fit comfortably into the sleeping space. The seats have a built-in massage function and large storage space.        
	The mini-pod seats include a privacy divider stocked with a selection of drinks and a comfort kit. Each seat has access to a 17-inch touchscreen TV.        
	The plane offers first and business class passengers private suites, shower spas and an onboard lounge with a range of drinks and canaps.        
	The Airbus A380 flight was part of a drill to reaffirm the operational readiness of the worlds sixth largest passenger terminal. The T3 terminal in Delhi has the capacity to handle 34 million passengers per annum and will be fully operational from July 28 after the synchronisation process among various airport agencies is complete.

	We do see India as one of the key markets where this product will be able to do full justice, Richard Vaughan, the senior vice-president of commercial operations said.        
	He said the firm saw a significant opportunity to start regular service on Indian routes, subject to government approval. Currently, the carrier operates 184 weekly flights to 10 Indian cities.        
	Majid Al Maulla, vice-president, Asia and Indian Ocean region, added: The fact that we are bringing in the A380 to Delhi is a reiteration of the potential we see in the Indian market and our intent to partner with the nation in its growth.        
	The writers journey was sponsored by Emirates

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            The Indian destroyer INS Mysore which will participate in sea drills with the US Navy                                  
	New Delhi, April 24: A US navy flotilla reached Goa yesterday for the latest edition of the Malabar series of exercises with the Indian Navy in which the two forces will practise anti-submarine warfare and special operations.        
	India does not conduct such large-scale naval exercises with any other country. The two navies believe they are inter-operable.        
	This is the first time the US Navy has sent its special forces, the Seals, with its frontline units for the exercise. The 14th round of the Malabar exercise will continue till May 2.        
	The ships from Americas Seventh Fleet include a guided missile cruiser, the USS Shiloh, destroyers USS Chaffee and USS Lassen, frigate USS Curts, a Los Angeles class nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Annapolis, two P3C Orion maritime surveillance aircraft and a 28-member US Navy special forces team.        
	From the Indian Navys Western Fleet, the guided missile destroyer, INS Mysore, and three guided missile frigates, the INS Godavari, INS Brahmaputra and INS Tabar, a submarine, the INS Shankush, Sea Harrier fighter aircraft, and helicopters are to participate in the bilateral exercise.        
	Naval co-operation between India and USA epitomises the long-term strategic relationship between both countries. Both navies have, over the years, undertaken diverse bilateral activities such as training exchanges, information exchanges, and technical co-operation. Our nations have significant convergence of interests, especially in the maintenance of maritime security, a statement from the Indian Navy said.        
	India and the US signed a Framework for Maritime Security Co-operation in 2006.        
	During the current edition of the exercise, the two navies will practise, apart from anti-submarine warfare, surface firing, maritime interdiction operations and Visit Board Search and Seizure.        
	The interoperability achieved over the years as a result of such exercises has proved to be operationally beneficial, particularly during the ongoing Anti Piracy Operations in the Gulf of Aden as also during Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief operations such as the tsunami of 2004, the navy statement said.

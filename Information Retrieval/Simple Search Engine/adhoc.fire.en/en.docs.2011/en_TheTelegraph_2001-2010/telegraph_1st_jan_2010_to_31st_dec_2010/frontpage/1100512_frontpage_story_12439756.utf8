The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cannes calls Mrinal Sen
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cannes calls Mrinal Sen
          AMIT ROY                      Mrinal Sen                          
	Cannes, May 11: Mrinal Sen will be present in Cannes to introduce a special screening of Kandahar (The Ruins), the authorities at the film festival are saying even though the director is 86 and in indifferent health.        
	Kandahar, due to be shown in Salle Bunuel, a prestigious venue, on Saturday, May 15, at 8.30pm, has been included in a section known as Cannes Classics. Yes, Mrinal Sen will attend the Cannes screening, Eliane Stutterheim, representing the film at the Cannes Film Festival, said today.        
	She drew attention to critic Peter Cowies tribute to Kandahar in the International Film Guide: Mrinal Sens exquisite film stands closer in fact to the contemplative cinema of Ozu, in which domestic relationships and the rhythm of the everyday, form the essence of the drama.         
	The Ruins is directed with masterly understatement by Sen. The dialogue is sparse, and the space between the sentences pregnant with longing and disappointment. The environment not only reflects the failure of the old mothers life, it is also integrated into mise-en-scene with no trace of ostentatiousness. The Ruins is depressing, yet to experience and to feel it is a rare delight.        
	The director may be accompanied by his son Kunal who today assured The Telegraph: Yes, he is definitely going to Cannes. The screening is on the 15th evening, so my father, my wife Nisha, and me will reach Cannes on 14th evening.        
	Kunal added: He was a member of the main (competition) jury in 1982, as far as I can remember. Many of his films have also been in the official selection at Cannes. His film Kharij also won the Special Jury Prize at Cannes.        
	Modern Indian films do not make it to the festivals main competition for a whole variety of complicated reasons but mainly because of the French view of what constitutes a good movie. Kandahar sort of makes up for their absence.        
	By Indian standards, Kandahar, directed in 1983 by Sen, is not long  only 102 minutes.        
	There have been problems in the past with the print quality of many of Sens other films. But Kandahar has been restored by Reliance MediaWorks with the support of the Indian state and the National Film Archive of India.         
	In the write-up on Sen, the festival authorities have pointed out that some of his films were overtly political and earned him the reputation as a Marxist artist  something guaranteed to endear him to the French intellectual elite.        
	Apart from the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2005, the French government awarded him the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of Arts and Letters).        
	Sen is obviously no stranger to Cannes. His French admirers will be hoping on what is likely to be his farewell view of the Croisette, he will be up to taking a nostalgic walk by the seafront before enjoying grilled lobster with a bottle (or two or three) of the best wine the locals are able to summon from their cellars. After all, the famous Bengali filmmaker, born on May 14, 1923, in Faridpur (now in Bangladesh), will be celebrating his 87th birthday on Friday.

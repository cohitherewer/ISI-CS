          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, Jan. 9: Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi today revealed that the state machinery was being extra vigilant to meet the challenges posed by Ulfas attempts to foment trouble .        
	Gogois revelation comes a day after state chief secretary P.C. Sharma held a meeting with departmental heads and security officials to review the security scenario in the run-up to Republic Day. The meet was held in the wake of Ulfa commander-in chief Paresh Baruas latest threat to attack security personnel and vital installations in the state.         
	Sources privy to yesterdays meeting had said explosives were floating around in the state despite the rise in recoveries by security personnel.         
	A tough-talking Gogoi said security forces were asked to remain extra vigilant to thwart the designs of Ulfa to create trouble.         
	Paresh Baruas threat is nothing new for us. His whole idea is to create terror in the minds of the people. But the people are also in a defiant mood. We have inputs to the effect that they are trying to indulge in blasts and grenade attacks, but we are also prepared. I have instructed security forces to remain extra vigilant and not spare anyone indulging in violence, he said.        
	Regarding talks with Ulfa, Gogoi said though the government had not received anything definite as yet, the signals from the outfits leaders in custody were positive.        
	 We will go ahead with talks without Paresh Barua but at the same time, would like him to be a part of the process, the chief minister said.         
	Talks have been held in the past without senior leaders like Phizo in Nagaland. Or like in the case of the DHD (J) and UPDS. Though our doors for talks are open, we will not slow down operations against those indulging in violence, he asserted.        
	On the Assam Rifles contention that 50 per cent of Ulfas lower cadre is from Bangladesh, Gogoi said he could neither confirm nor deny such information.         
	Sources today said a senior army officer had pointed out that Paresh Barua would now do anything to make his presence felt.         
	Meanwhile, Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa and foreign secretary Sasha Choudhury were given dental treatment at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital here today.

          ARCHIS MOHAN                                         Hasina (top), Mamata                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 4: Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is set to strike off Bengal from her forthcoming visit because she wants to hurry home and claim the laurels of fetching a $500-million credit kitty she is likely to receive from New Delhi.         
	Theres another reason Bengal is losing out on the state visitor from Sonar Bangla: the states own house is not quite in order.        
	Visva-Bharati, where Hasina was particularly keen to spend some time, is currently ploughing through an administrative mess.         
	The employees of the university had levelled corruption charges against the vice-chancellor, setting off hunger strikes by the accusers and a day-long prayer by the senior academic. On the request of the vice-chancellor, the Prime Minister has set up a panel to probe the allegations.        
	Bengal also does not have a full-time governor now and a new one is not likely to be appointed until after Republic Day.         
	Both factors could have looped the visit in uncomfortable circumstances.         
	Hasina is scheduled to start her three-day state visit from this weekend and was initially meant to stop over in Calcutta on her way back home. Officially, the change in her itinerary is being ascribed to security reasons and domestic engagements.        
	But The Telegraph has learnt that the last-minute changes had to be pencilled in essentially because Bengal was not quite prepared to receive a high-level guest.         
	Hasina was to have met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and paid a visit to Bengals ailing icon, Jyoti Basu, his health permitting.        
	Hasinas keenness to announce the big credit package to her home audience was equally a reason. The Bangladeshi ruling establishment is apprehensive that any delay in announcing deals cut with India would give space to the Opposition to allege a sellout.         
	India and Bangladesh are expected to ink several crucial agreements, some of which could draw the ire of the Opposition in Dhaka. Khaleda Zias Bangladesh Nationalist Party, traditionally seen as a Pakistan ally, has already threatened to take to the streets in the event of any unequal deal.        
	The likely agreements relate to Indias concerns over insurgents finding a haven in Bangladesh. The arrest of Ulfa leader Arabinda Rajkhowa in Bangladesh has been a major success in Indias relations with Bangladesh.        
	India is expected to provide concessions in areas like import of garments.

	Ranchi, June 5: After Congress, it was the JMMs turn today to propose the name of its nominee for the Rajya Sabha biennials.        
	The JMM fielded Alchemist Hospitals Group chairman Kanwar Deep Singh as its candidate. Assembly secretary Kaushal Kishore Prasad confirmed that Singh filed his nomination today though JMM chief Shibu Soren had initially proposed Supreme Court lawyer Sanjeev Kumars name.         
	When Soren left for Delhi yesterday, it was presumed that he had been summoned by the Congress leadership and that preparations for the Rajya Sabha elections and formation of an alternative government in Jharkhand were the main agenda of the meeting.        
	However, Soren did not meet the Congress president in Delhi. Instead, he came back by a special flight in the morning, accompanied by Singh. They proceeded to senior JMM leader Teklal Mahtos residence, where party MLAs and office bearers were already waiting. Soren ordered that necessary arrangements be made to allow Singh to file his nomination papers at the earliest.        
	Only Guruji can say what happened in Delhi. According to his orders, we have begun campaigning for Singhs success. Let us hope that things work out well, senior JMM leader Hemlal Murmu told The Telegraph.        
	Meanwhile, sources said Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto was not happy with Sorens decision to field Singh. Mahto confined himself to his Silli residence instead of participating in the nomination process. He had earlier proposed that a local leader be sent to the Rajya Sabha instead of bringing in outsiders. Mahto also reportedly turned down BJP chief Nitin Gadkaris invitation to go to Delhi for talks.        
	We will soon decide what to do during the biennial, Mahto said over telephone.         
	Singh claimed he decided to contest the Rajya Sabha seat in Jharkhand only after getting assurances from Shibu Soren, Hemant Soren and Sudesh Mahto and was confident of their full support. He promised to make honest efforts to improve medical facilities in Jharkhand.        
	I have closely been associated with Jharkhand for long. I run a flying club in Jamshedpur, which has trained over 200 pilots. I am also running super speciality hospitals in Delhi and Chandigrah and want to do something new in Jharkhand also, he added.        
	Irked by the Congress decision to field Dheeraj Prasad Sahu for the Rajya Sabha seat, the JVM (P) too today resolved to field its own candidate. It authorised party president Babulal Marandi to finalise the nominee. The Congress dare not take our support for granted and treat our party president like the JMM supremo. Even if our candidate doesnt win, we will ensure a Congress defeat, fumed a senior JVM leader.        
	Congress state unit chief Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu admitted that his party had made certain strategic mistakes while declaring Sahus candidature. However, he also claimed that the Congress-JVM alliance was intact and that the Congress candidate would get at least 30 first preference votes during polling on June 17.        
	The BJP is likely to declare its candidate tomorrow.

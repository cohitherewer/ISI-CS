	Ranchi, June 24: Thanks perhaps to Presidents rule, Jharkhand received a patient hearing from the Planning Commission that okayed the infusion of more funds to deal with the Naxalite menace.        
	After two rounds of meetings with the state top brass in New Delhi today, the commission approved a Plan outlay of Rs 9,240 crore, Rs 240 crore more than what was proposed by the state administration for 2010-11.        
	The additional Rs 200 crore was earmarked exclusively for the 11 Naxalite affected districts. Besides, the state would get Rs 40 crore as additional central assistance for constructing buildings for various block offices.        
	 We came with a plan outlay proposal of Rs 9,000 crore. But during the meeting the commission asked us to earmark Rs 200 crore exclusively for the Naxalite-affected districts, chief secretary Ashok Kumar Singh told The Telegraph.         
	To be drawn from state resources, Rs 200 crore will be spent for connecting small habitats which are not covered under the Prime Ministers Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), he pointed out.         
	The funds will be used to build roads to connect small habitats with population of 250 in scheduled areas and 500 in non- scheduled areas in the current fiscal, the chief secretary explained.        
	The state administration, he added, had proposed a Plan outlay of Rs 9,000 crore, which was Rs 400 crore more than what was okayed by the former government of Shibu Soren for the current fiscal.         
	The outlay for 2009-10 fiscal was pegged at Rs 8,200 crore.        
	The Centre has already proposed to grant Rs 1,100 crore for 11 rebel infested districts. Deputy commissioners have been advised to focus on the basics like road and bridge connectivity, drinking water, education, health etc.        
	 The 11 districts of Jharkhand  among 33 districts worst effected by Maoist terror across the country  are Palamau, Chatra, Garhwa, Latehar, Gumla, Lohardaga, East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum, Hazaribagh, Bokaro and Ramgarh.         
	 An increase of another Rs 400 crore was attributed to the hike in the annual Plan outlay of agriculture, human resources development department, energy, industries and planning department, while the outlay for the forest department was reduced to Rs 128.71 crore from Rs 130 crore.        
	Todays meeting in Delhi was chaired by Planning Commission member K. Kasturirangan, who is in-charge of Jharkhand.         
	Besides the chief secretary, those who attended the meeting included development commissioner Sushil Kumar Choudhary, planning secretary Sudhir Prasad and finance secretary Sukhdev Singh.

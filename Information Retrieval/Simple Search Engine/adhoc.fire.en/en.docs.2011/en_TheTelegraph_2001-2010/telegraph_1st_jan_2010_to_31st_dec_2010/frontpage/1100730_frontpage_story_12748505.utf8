The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Drought worries put Raj Bhavan on alert
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Drought worries put Raj Bhavan on alert
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, July 29: Poor rainfall seems to be driving Jharkhand towards the inevitable though it is still shying away from declaring itself drought-hit, an announcement that will at least enable the states disaster management department to undertake special measures.        
	So far no complain of foodgrain scarcity has been reported from any part. However, as the state has received poor rainfall this year too, a drought-like situation is imminent. Special steps cannot be initiated unless it is officially declared as drought-hit, explained disaster management department secretary M.N. Kerketta.        
	This year, the state has received 95mm rainfall during June against the normal average of 250mm. In July, till yesterday, the average rainfall was around 125mm when the state average for the month is around 300mm.         
	As of now, with only 20 per cent paddy fields having been sown and groundwater levels depleting fast, Raj Bhavan is closely monitoring the situation. Among the districts under watch are Palamau, Latehar, Garwah, Dhanbad and Bokaro.        
	Governor M..H. Farook and chief secretary Ashok Kumar Singh have held a number of meetings to study the situation. Agriculture secretary Arun Kumar Singh is compiling detailed reports on paddy cultivation till July 31 and exploring possibilities of alternate cropping.         
	It will take another month to compile the report sought by the governor. Paddy cultivation will become practically impossible after a week or so, commented a senior department official.        
	Last year, Jharkhand was declared drought-hit even though the average rainfall was comparatively better  it received around 100mm in June and about 225mm in July.         
	Political parties have already upped the ante. BJP national general secretary and former chief minister Arjun Munda demanded that the state be declared famine-hit as alternative crops were also likely to fail with irrigation projects in a shambles.        
	The poor have already been crushed by soaring prices. Now, droughts in successive years have made their life miserable. The states official machinery is insensitive, he claimed.        
	State Congress chief Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu alleged that the poor werent getting PDS supplies on time. The governor has assured us of positive action. We are also trying to secure an appointment with the Prime Minister to seek special assistance for Jharkhand, he added.

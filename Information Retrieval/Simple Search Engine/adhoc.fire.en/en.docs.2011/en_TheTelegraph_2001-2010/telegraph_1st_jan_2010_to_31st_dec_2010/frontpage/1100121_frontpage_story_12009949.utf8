          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                            Osmania University students beat a policeman in Hyderabad on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, Jan. 20: The statehood strife, stalled during an undeclared truce for the Sankranti festivities, erupted today with the Osmania University campus turning into a battlefield, a day after two students immolated themselves in support of the cause.         
	The clash with police today was the 215th on the campus since 1969, when the agitation was launched. The university has since become the bedrock of the movement and the students have been shepherding it this time as well.        
	The tension simmering since the recovery of the charred remains of K. Venugopal Reddy, a masters degree student of computer applications, from the Osmania campus exploded when the agitation spearheads wanted to take out a procession with the body from the university to the Assembly, a distance of 8km.        
	Adding to the unease was the death of Suvarnamma, a science undergraduate studying in a college in Mahbubnagar affiliated to the university. She set herself ablaze yesterday and, like Reddy, left a suicide note saying she was taking her life as she feared Telangana would not become reality.        
	The police, not willing to allow the students march lest it fuel trouble, snatched the body of Reddy from the protesters and rushed it to the boys native village in Nalgonda district, 150km away, for the last rites.        
	Furious, the students retaliated by setting a police jeep on fire and attacked the officials in khaki with stones. The police lathicharged, lobbed teargas shells, fired rubber bullets and used water cannons to beat back the students, at least 30 of whom were injured. Around 15 policemen were wounded in the clash.         
	Three leaders of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, the party whose main agenda is a separate state, visited the campus but were refused entry by the police. The trio  K.T. Rama Rao, T. Harish Rao and Etela Rajinder  insisted and were arrested.         
	The Joint Action Committee of the political outfits showed solidarity with the students. The contradictory and confusing statements made by central leaders of the Congress since the January 5 meeting (on Telangana) have created confusion and is responsible for the suicides by students, said M. Kodandaram, convener of the committee.        
	The Osmania students are observing a 48-hour bandh in the Telangana region following the suicides, which are being seen as a sign of the increasing desperation among the young statehood supporters because of the political tug-of-war over the agitation.        
	Cracks have already surfaced within the political parties. The committee had announced that all pro-Telangana MLAs and MPs would start submitting resignations from today and those who have already done so would press the authorities concerned to accept them.        
	Those who dont resign will be treated as traitors, said Kodandaram, convener of the committee.        
	The committee has issued a deadline of January 28 to start the process for Telangana with the threat of an intensified agitation if Delhi did not accede to their demand.         
	But a section of Congress leaders are opposed to resigning, saying they would abide by the high command diktat to wait till the final solution is found.        
	Political analysts said with students taking the movement in their hands, the elected representatives, irrespective of party affiliation, would be under pressure to quit.

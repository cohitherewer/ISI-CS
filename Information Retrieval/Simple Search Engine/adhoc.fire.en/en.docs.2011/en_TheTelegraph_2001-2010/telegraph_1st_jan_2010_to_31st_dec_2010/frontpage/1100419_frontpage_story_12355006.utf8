The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Singh wants to focus on Pak
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Singh wants to focus on Pak
  - Drive to tackle IPL fast and revive peace process           K.P. NAYAR                            From top: Singh and Gilani                                
	New Delhi, April 18: Manmohan Singh has set an internal deadline of 10 days in the Prime Ministers Office to resolve the controversy surrounding the Indian Premier League.        
	India has reason to expect some credible steps by Islamabad in the next few days by way of action against terrorist groups plotting against this country, sources in Washington who conducted high-level talks with Singh and Pakistans Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani separately in the US on April 11 told The Telegraph today.        
	American expectations are that any steps which they hope are to be imminently taken by Gilanis government will enable India and Pakistan to have at least a semblance of bilateral talks on the sidelines of a summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (Saarc) to be held in Bhutan at the end of this month.        
	Singh is to leave for Bhutan on the morning of April 27, according to present plans. He is determined that any talk with Islamabad must receive the widest possible attention in Indias public domain so that the government can muster popular support for a new Pakistan initiative and avoid the pitfalls in Sharm-el-Sheikh last year.        
	For that, the cloud created by the Tharoor-IPL controversy has to clear and normal political discourse has to resume with focus on the days important agenda such as engagement of Pakistan on the sidelines of the Saarc summit.        
	Singhs programme in Bhutan has been planned in such a way that he will have an entire free afternoon, as of now, on the eve of the summit and at least 12 hours after the final Saarc ceremonies so that a meeting with Gilani can be scheduled if Islamabad goes at least half way towards satisfying Indian conditions for resuming the bilateral dialogue.        
	A high-level source in the Indian government who was part of the delegation to the talks between Barack Obama and Singh yesterday refused to rule out talks with Pakistan on the sidelines of the Saarc summit by saying that nothing is inevitable in diplomacy.        
	The source, who is constantly consulted by Singh on the need for a thaw with Pakistan  which Singh is convinced about  said it would be stupid to argue that India would not talk to Pakistan come what may unless Indias dictates were accepted in toto by Islamabad.        
	Reflecting the current political mood in New Delhi which has been overshadowed by cricket, the source framed the possibility of Indo-Pak talks in Bhutan in cricketing terms. If a bowler knows what stroke he (the batsman) is going to play, there is no game.        
	The source said the Indian delegation was now planning for the Saarc summit on the assumption that the likelihood of talks with the Pakistanis were uncharted territory to be crossed when the other side took at least some steps to meet Indian concerns over terrorism.        
	In the Prime Ministers delegation which travelled to Washington, there has been a nuanced, but significant, shift in the conditions for continuing talks with Pakistan which were resumed at the foreign secretary level in February.        
	The shift flows from a view that India was too specific about conditions for bilateral dialogue during and after the meeting of foreign secretaries, which left Pakistan with no face-saving manoeuvres that would have met Indian demands without appearing to its own public that Islamabad was meekly surrendering.         
	Indias new position is that the arrest of Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed is not central to the continuation of Indo-Pakistan talks. Even if Hafiz Saeed is removed from the world, that will not be the solution to the problem of cross-border terrorism, the source said.        
	What India needs to be convinced is that there is some will on the other side to crack down on terrorism against India in the same way that General Pervez Musharraf gave assurances about addressing Indian concerns and followed up on those assurances.        
	In the run-up to the Saarc summit, therefore, India will not be putting down conditions in black and white for regular bilateral talks with Pakistan.        
	Sources in Washington said there had been a similar nuanced shift in Pakistans position as well. In recent public pronouncements, Pakistani leaders are no longer insisting that they would be satisfied with nothing short of a resumption of the so-called composite dialogue with India. Giving up that demand will give India more room for manoeuvre and take small steps in the direction of the Prime Ministers desire for a rapprochement with Islamabad.

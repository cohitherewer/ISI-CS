The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | WHAT WILL BE IN
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                WHAT WILL BE IN
                                                  
	Bicycles: Green transport, and a solution to traffic problems. Even Milan, the fashion capital of car-loving Italy, is embracing bicycles. Paris, Barcelona and many other cities have started a cycle-on-hire scheme with tens of thousands of bikes and hundreds of docking stations; and London gets started in 2010        
	Slim menus: Restaurants may realise that 16 or 20-page menus not only delay the patron from ordering; they mean the eateries have to buy and store more ingredients        
	Glass lifts: Now seen mostly in posh hotels, they may ascend  or descend, depending on your point of view  to become the standard        
	Ringback tones: Already hugely popular in India and elsewhere in Asia; but the rest of the world will catch up so that revenue from ringbacks will overtake ringtone sales        
	3D films: To go mainstream within five years as more cinemas convert to the technology. The Blu-ray Disc is likely to be the preferred medium for at-home 3D consumption                  
	MOST WANTED        
	Standard cellphone charger: There are at least 30 different models today and when you buy a new mobile, you often have to throw away the old charger   
	Indian Literature Nobel laureate: After the serial Booker successes and good showings on best-seller lists, why not?  
	Cure for cancer, AIDS: The usual hope        
	TENDENTIOUS        
	What will the 2010s be known as? The Tens can make the whole world feel tense; the Teens may hit the right tenor with the tender-hearted but are not tenable  they cannot start till 2013 and will anyway have parents on tenterhooks. Setting aside all tentative thoughts, the UN has dryly declared a Decade for Deserts in a campaign to curb their tendency to spread. Will need tenacity, for sure.        
	The names of the individual years will be easier on the tongue, though. You couldnt call 2009 twenty nine but the years of the new decade can be called twenty ten, twenty eleven and so on

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  (From top) PRS Oberoi, Mukesh Ambani and YC Deveshwar                                 
	Mumbai, Aug. 30: Mukesh Ambani has stepped in as a white knight to help Prithvi Raj Singh (Biki) Oberoi, the 80-year-old chairman of hotel chain owner EIH Ltd, to ward off a hostile takeover threat from Calcutta-based cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate ITC Ltd.        
	Ambani-owned Reliance Industries today bought a 14.12 per cent stake in the hotel group from the Oberoi family for Rs 1,021 crore, signalling its entry into the hospitality segment.         
	In a development that took both stock markets and investment bankers by surprise, Reliance Industries announced that its subsidiary  Reliance Industries Investment and Holding Private Ltd  had bought the shares at an average price of Rs 184 a share.         
	The share acquisition price is at a 36 per cent premium over Fridays closing level of Rs 135.20 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	On Monday, the EIH stock vaulted 11.46 per cent to close at Rs 150.70, still 18 per cent adrift of the price that the Ambanis paid for the stock. Market experts expect the stock to slowly nudge upwards but its course could be determined by the moves that ITC now makes.        
	The stake sale will head off the takeover threat that has loomed over EIH for close to 10 years ever since ITC started aggressively buying shares in the company and reached 14.98 per cent.        
	ITC chairman Yogi Deveshwar had termed the stake purchase a pure investment play but Biki Oberoi always remained wary.        
	Last year, the Oberois had opened talks with Analjit Singh  chairman of the Max group  to pick up a stake in EIH and build a protective moat around the hotel chain that owns and operates 27 hotels under the Oberoi and Trident brands in India and abroad.        
	Analjit Singh, who had made a little over Rs 500 crore last year when he sold a small stake in Vodafone Essar, had agreed to bail out the Oberois and had even picked up 4 per cent in EIH before talks broke down earlier this year.        
	Biki Oberoi then quietly approached Mukesh, Indias richest tycoon, even as he drew a red herring by telling EIH shareholders last week that he was working on a succession plan.        
	Oberoi had also indicated that the promoters intended to raise their stake through market purchases from the current level of 46.4 per cent. Capital market watchdog Sebi permits promoters to raise their stake by 5 per cent each year through market purchases.        
	Mukeshs stake purchase in EIH now raises the prospect of an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation with ITCs Deveshwar who just needs to pick up another 0.02 per cent stake from the market before he triggers a mandatory open offer to minority shareholders of EIH.        
	Under the takeover rules, an acquirer has to make an open offer for another 20 per cent of the outstanding shares once his holding crosses the 15 per cent threshold.        
	However, observers do not expect ITC, which is celebrating its centenary this year, to take such a precipitate step. ITC declined to comment on the EIH-Reliance deal.        
	The developments have also thrown up an enthralling prospect. Sources said the stake purchase would entitle RIL to one board position. It stoked speculation that Mukeshs wife Nita, who runs a school in Mumbai and oversees the Mumbai Indians IPL team, might be nominated to the EIH board.        
	The Ambanis are content for now to hold on to their stake and let the Oberois run the show. RIL has full faith in and would support the management of EIH Ltd and there is no change of management, operation or control of EIH Ltd, the company said in a statement.        
	Biki Oberoi said: Reliance Industries desired to make a long-term financial investment we were happy to encourage their investment in EIH.

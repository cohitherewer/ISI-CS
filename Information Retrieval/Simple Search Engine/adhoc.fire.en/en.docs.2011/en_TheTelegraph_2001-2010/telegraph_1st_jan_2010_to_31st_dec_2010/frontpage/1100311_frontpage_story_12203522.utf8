The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Is it a car? No, its an office
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Is it a car? No, its an office
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                      K Sudhakar Yadav                          
	Hyderabad, March 10: When K. Sudhakar Yadav sits in his office, he uses a 1908 Ford Model T. Since he loves being in the drivers seat always, his desk has a steering wheel, too.        
	Welcome to the wacky world of Sudhacar, er, Sudhakar, the carmaker.        
	Only this time, instead of making small bicycles or long tricycle or funny models like Cricket Ball Car, Football Car, or Double Bed Car, the freewheeling Hyderabad entrepreneur has gone vintage.        
	His office at Bahadurpura in the Old City has been entirely designed with spare parts of Ford Model T, Austin, Lagonda and the 1937 Buick.        
	The sofas are made of 1930 Buick and Ford Jalopy parts. The central table is made of the body of a 1927 Austin.         
	The focal point of the office, his massive desk, has been crafted from a 1908 Ford Model T that had put the world on wheels at the beginning of the last century.        
	The steering wheel stands out in the auto-ambience of the 20ftx40ft office next to his museum-cum-workshop, built on a 1,000sqft area.        
	Sudhakar, who entered the Guinness World Records for making the longest tricycle and the Limca Book of Records for the smallest double-decker bus, has enjoyed making every one of his wacky cars.

	Each one is like a child to me, he says, but the car-office was a childhood dream come true.        
	I wanted to build my own office with used cars or some scrap metal from these vintage cars. I am happy I could achieve it now, says Sudhakar, whose nameplate spells his name as Sudhacar.        
	So how much did it cost him to do up his office? Sudhakar, who scours scrap yards for all his materials and spends hours in his workshop, says if the antique value of the spares and the car parts are taken into account, it could be something around Rs 2 crore. But the materials had cost him about Rs 5 lakh.        
	The cabinet in the office is modelled on a 1930s Buffalo gasoline pump. Car doors have replaced windows. Others that have added to the vintage touch are parts of 1923 Wolseley and a 1930 Lagonda Tourer horn.        
	A 1937 Willys-Knight gearbox has found utility as an office pedestal lamp, which illuminates the room with a soft yellow haze.         
	A poster behind the massive desk sums up the mood: a picture of one of the first assembly lines at the Ford factory.        
	A penny-farthing cycle rests along the wall, completing the yesteryear auto-ambience.        
	Sudhakar got hooked to his hobby of making vehicles when he was 14. He designed a bicycle and the next year, made his first Easy Rider Motorbike.         
	He tried his hands at a four-wheeler as an intermediate student and came up with a rugged looking Dune Buggy.        
	Today, he has to his credit dozens of different types of cars, 30 types of bicycles, including the smallest bicycle in India which is about 6 inches high; and 12 types of motorcycles, the smallest being 13 inches high, which can travel at a speed of about 30kmph.        
	He has also designed early 20th century models of cars and buses, both single and double-decker.        
	The buses are now used for sightseeing in the city and in the temple town of Tirupati.                    
	For a social cause, Sudhakar has also made a Condom Bike in the shape of a condom to spread awareness about AIDS. The bike has a built-in player, which gives a brief history about the deadly affliction.         
	The Cricket Ball Car was specially made to cheer Team India for the 2003 World Cup, while the Football Car was built to commemorate the 2006 World Cup.         
	All his creations are made of scrap and workable.        
	The tricycle, which won Sudhakar a place in the Guinness records, is 41ft 7 inches tall, 37ft 4 inches long, has a wheel diameter of 17ft, weighs about three tons and took him over three years to build.        
	Some of the models being worked on are Fountain Pen Bike, Basketball Car, Tennis Ball Car, Ladies Handbag Car, Stiletto Car, Lipstick Bike, Pressure Cooker Car, Sofa Car, Book Car and Mobile Phone Car.

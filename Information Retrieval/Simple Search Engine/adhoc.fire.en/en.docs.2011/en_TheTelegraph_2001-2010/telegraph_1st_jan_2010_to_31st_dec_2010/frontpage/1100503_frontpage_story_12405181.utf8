          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Shibu Soren inspects Ranchi Ring Road on Sunday. Telegraph picture                                        
	New Delhi, May 2: The BJP is willing to wait for a few more days for Shibu Soren to put in his papers as chief minister and has, therefore, asked his son Hemant to simultaneously offer a letter of support to a government that will be led by it, indicating the Jharkhand stalemate is unlikely to end soon.        
	In a four-hour-long meeting that BJP president Nitin Gadkari and senior leaders Rajnath Singh, Ananth Kumar and Ramlal had with Soren junior, Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto and JD(U)s Jaleshwar Mahto yesterday, the party also emphasised that the JMM will first have to put its house in order and secure a letter of support from each of its MLA for a BJP-led government.        
	Otherwise we are not interested in doing business with them, a senior leader present at the meeting told The Telegraph. Hemant, however, wasnt able to give a commitment on the BJPs demands.         
	With no breakthrough yet, the parliamentary board that was slated to meet today, put off the meeting indefinitely.         
	Differences have cropped up in the BJPs top echelons. Some questioned the wisdom of biting Hemants bait of installing a BJP chief minister without considering the uncertainty inherent in renegotiating a deal with a proven unreliable ally like the JMM.         
	We should have thought through things carefully before rushing into them, a Gadkari aide admitted.         
	The sceptics felt their reservations were vindicated when on Saturday, Hemant asked the BJP to let his father continue as chief minister for the next couple of months after which he will be required to seek election to the Assembly.         
	Hemants point was since Soren was unlikely to find a seat, he will automatically relinquish chief ministership, paving the way for a BJP takeover. No BJP leader was persuaded by this argument. One of them said, It confirmed our suspicions that Hemant was not in control of the JMM MLAs, that Soren was unwilling to let go of his post and might well be double-dealing with the Congress and that the trust deficit between us and the JMM has grown since the cut motion disaster.         
	In such a fluid scenario, the BJP feared the Ajsu and other constituents of the existing coalition might search for greener pastures to avert Presidents rule and a fresh election.         
	Sources have started blaming Rajnath for advising Gadkari to rethink the withdrawal of support decision.                                                   
	It is learnt that Rajnaths main contention was if Jharkhand was brought under Presidents rule, it might adversely impact the Dal (U)-BJPs prospects in the Bihar elections though nobody found substance in the argument.         
	He (Rajnath) apparently told Gadkari that both scenarios would work against the BJP and its ally in Bihar. If the Congress were to form a government with JMM and RJD that will be bad and equally central rule, too, will be bad. We feel the Bihar polls will be fought on Nitish Kumar governments performance, the changing caste dynamics, the apparent lack of unity in the Opposition, an office-bearer said.         
	The only reason the BJP ruled out a Congress-JMM dispensation was that it might fall short of the required numbers because the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha of Babulal Marandi, presently a UPA constituent, ruled out truck with the Sorens.        
	 Marandi and the Sorens were rivals for the same tribal vote-bank. Marandi has 11 MLAsa block that cannot be sniffed at in a precarious numbers game. About chances of a possible rapprochement with Soren, a leader replied, Fifty-fifty. My belief is we should wait for a day or two at most. If h doesnt quit, we should meet the Governor and formally withdraw support. Thats the only way of cutting our political losses.

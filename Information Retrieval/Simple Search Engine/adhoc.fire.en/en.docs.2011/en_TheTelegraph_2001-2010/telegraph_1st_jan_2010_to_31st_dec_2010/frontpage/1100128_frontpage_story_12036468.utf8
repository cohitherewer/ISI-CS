          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 27: Security forces today combed Kherbari village and its adjoining areas in Golaghat district along the Assam-Nagaland boundary for a missing AK-47 rifle.        
	The AK-47 was snatched by the villagers along with a 9mm pistol from a group of armymen from the 2/11 Gorkha regiment on Monday night in a case of mistaken identity. The villagers had also attacked the team, killing jawan Achal Kumar Limbu and injuring four others, including Captain Vikram Singh, mistaking them for Naga militants.        
	Two Naga youths accompanying the army personnel were also injured in the attack.         
	The army claims that the team, accompanied by informers, had gone to the village in Dhansiri subdivision following specific information about a group of militants taking shelter there. But the villagers mistook them to be the Naga militants.         
	Suspected Naga militants had slapped a demand of Rs 5 lakh on a shopowner in the village a few days ago.         
	Sarupathar legislator Binod Gowala, who joined a protest rally taken out by the villagers today, told this correspondent that a five armed persons, accompanied by two Naga youths, had attempted to kidnap Allaudin, the owner of a stone crushing unit, for refusing to pay Rs 5 lakh. Hundreds of people from adjoining Badyapur and Madhupur villagers arrived at Kherbari and freed Allaudin from the clutches of the group, which the villagers suspected to be NSCN militants, he said.        
	The villagers beat up the army personnel who were dressed in civvies.         
	On getting the information, police and CRPF personnel rushed to the spot and rescued the other armymen.        
	The identity of the group came to light only after they were interrogated at Uriamghat police station, Gowala said.        
	The villagers handed over a 9mm pistol to the police but an AK-47 rifle is still missing.        
	Golaghat SP Madan Chetia said additional SP (headquarters) B.B. Gogoi has been directed to conduct a detail inquiry into the incident.         
	The SP said a search has been launched in the area to locate the missing rifle. We fear the rifle may found way into the hands of militants.         
	The army also reported the missing AK-47 rifle to the police. The Gorkha Rifles and Allauddin lodged separate FIRs at Uraimghat police station.         
	The villagers took out a procession today protesting harassment by army personnel. They submitted a memorandum to Dhansiri subdivisional officer (civil) C.D. Singha, demanding withdrawal of the army from Dhansiri subdivision and a high-level inquiry.

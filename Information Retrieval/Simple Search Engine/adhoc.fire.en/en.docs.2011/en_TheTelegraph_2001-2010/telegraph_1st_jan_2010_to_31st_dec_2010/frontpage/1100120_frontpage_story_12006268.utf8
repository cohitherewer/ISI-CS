The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Grief can trigger sympathy wave but not when bond has eroded
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Grief can trigger sympathy wave but not when bond has eroded
                      
	The death of Jyoti Basu has plunged sections of Bengals masses into grief, but whether it influences near-term voting patterns in the state will hinge on how much the public still associates him with the CPM of today, social psychologists say.         
	Some behavioural scientists believe that while Bengals  and Indias  longest-serving chief minister was an iconic leader, the bond between the public and Basu had eroded in recent years after he distanced himself from public activities.        
	Grief can trigger electoral sympathy waves that have often shown up in elections in India and abroad. In December 1984, the Congress under Rajiv Gandhi won the biggest landslide in Indias electoral history, riding on the sympathy wave following the assassination of his mother Indira Gandhi on October 31 that year. The Congress came to power in 1984 with 414 seats.         
	Any intense emotion such as grief can cloud critical thinking and rational decision-making. This is an accepted psychological phenomenon, said Janak Pandey, a leading social psychologist and former head of the Centre for Cognitive and Behavioural Sciences at the University of Allahabad.        
	In 1964, after President John F. Kennedys assassination a year earlier, Lyndon Johnson defeated Republican Barry Goldwater to become President in one of the most lopsided contests in US political history. Democrat Johnson, who was Vice-President under Kennedy, won 486 electoral college votes against Goldwaters 52.        
	Until Rajivs assassination in 1991, opinion polls had indicated the Congress would have to struggle to regain power. But the party won significant seats, sweeping Tamil Nadu, after his assassination midway through the elections. The seats won after his assassination helped the Congress push close enough to the majority mark to form the government.        
	People are likely to feel sympathetic towards Basu, Pandey said. But whether this translates into votes would depend on whether the public sees a strong association between Jyoti Basu and the party (CPM) of today, It is possible that people may believe the party has evolved, changed from what Basu was associated with, he said.        
	There is likely to be collective emotional response from the public only if a state or a nation feels deeply bonded to a leader, said Rajat Mitra, a clinical psychologist in New Delhi. I dont think this is the case in Bengal. And if such a bond doesnt exist, were not likely to see any impact on voting patterns.        
	Basus natural death and the relatively long period between his death and Bengals scheduled elections in 2011 also make a sympathy wave less likely, according to behavioural scientists.        
	The DMK victory in the 1989 Tamil Nadu elections  after the natural death of another icon, M.G. Ramachandran of the ADMK, in 1987  indicates how weakened bonds as well as natural deaths may dilute sympathy.        
	Besides, the ADMK had experienced intense internal turmoil after MGRs death, somewhat similar to the apparent confusion within the CPM now on what direction the party should take. Such internal tussles may also blunt any sympathy that might otherwise have electorally helped the party of a deceased leader, analysts say.        
	The CPM in Bengal possibly faces a situation that resembles what the party experienced in Kerala  the natural death of E.M.S. Namboodiripad in 1998 with Assembly elections due in 2001. The CPM lost that election to the Congress in Kerala.        
	History suggests that sympathy waves are more likely after assassinations. In the case of a natural death, the height of emotion will be different, Pandey said. People like to target a cause. An assassination or violent death can trigger grief plus anger  and two intense emotions would tend to cloud decision-making more than one emotion.                    G.S. MUDUR AND CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Onion alert fell on thick skin
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Onion alert fell on thick skin
  - Information was conveyed in mid-November: Scientist           G.S. MUDUR                                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: Crop scientists tracking the plight of Indias onion belt under persistent and unseasonal rain this year had sensed a looming shortage and cautioned the government more than four weeks ago.         
	The scientists did not specifically say which government agency was informed but they are associated with a research council that reports to the agriculture ministry.        
	The ministry is headed by Sharad Pawar, whose perceived nonchalant comments yesterday had triggered a letter from the Prime Ministers Office seeking immediate action.         
	The rains not only harmed the Kharif onion crop harvested in October, they also damaged about 10 per cent of nursery crops being raised for the next cycle of Rabi onion typically harvested during April or May, said Kisan Eknath Lawande, the director of the National Research Centre for Onion and Garlic (NRCOG).        
	This was conveyed to the government by mid-November  the state and central government machinery knew this was going to happen, Lawande told The Telegraph.         
	Not that no action was taken, though several central officials have been saying they were surprised by the price rise.        
	At least one step was taken in November itself. The minimum export price for onions  the least amount an onion exporter should sell for  was raised from $300 per tonne in October to $500 in November to $1,500 in early December, Lawande said. The government earlier this week banned onion exports.         
	But more aggressive options  such as imports  were considered only today, more than a month after the scientists flashed the alert.                    
	The fundamental problem appears to be one that afflicts several spheres in the country: do little till a full-blown crisis erupts. In this case, the roots seem to be leading to a failure to promote crop management technologies that may reduce the risk of water and humidity damage to onions.        
	Excess moisture from widespread rain over western Maharashtra during late October and most of November seeped into the soil, devastating onion bulbs still in the ground as well as harvested plants that were awaiting transport towards the nations kitchens.         
	We watched onions rot even in our own fields, said Vijay Mahajan, a horticulture scientist at the NRCOG in Rajgurunagar, about 45km from Pune. The NRCOG is affiliated to the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), which reports to the agriculture ministry.        
	The laboratory falls in an area stretching from Pune to Nanded to Nashik, a core onion-growing zone of Maharashtra, a state that accounts for 30 to 40 per cent of the national annual onion produce.         
	Scientists at the NRCOG estimate that western Maharashtra this year has lost up to 60 per cent of its onions, primarily because the rain in late October came right after the harvest when the onions were left in open fields to be cured and dried.        
	In high moisture and humidity, onions germinate and develop black mould.         
	Farmers have not adopted crop management technologies on a large scale. One such technology involves planting onions on raised beds instead of traditional flat beds and adopting sprinkler and drip irrigation instead of conventional watering. But, Lawande estimates, less than 10 per cent of onion crop is on raised beds or supported by sprinkler or drip irrigation.         
	Onions are harvested in India thrice a year. Kharif onion harvested in October and the late-Kharif onion harvested in January each accounts for 20 per cent of the total produce, while Rabi onion harvested in April and May makes up the remaining 60 per cent.         
	The western Maharashtra onion belt is a largely dry region and farmers find it attractive to harvest Kharif onion so they can take advantage of the monsoon, said Arunachalam Thangasamy, a soil scientist at the NRCOG.         
	In excess moisture and humidity conditions, onions can be stored only for about 30 to 45 days. Senior agricultural scientists estimate that India loses 40 to 50 per cent of onions through poor storage. While superior storage technologies may reduce the risk of damage during storage, such technologies would mean significant investments by farmers, NRCOG director Lawande said.

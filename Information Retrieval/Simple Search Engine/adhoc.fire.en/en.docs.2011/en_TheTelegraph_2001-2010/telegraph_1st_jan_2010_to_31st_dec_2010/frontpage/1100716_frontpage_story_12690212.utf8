The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PC rules out talks with new outfits
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                PC rules out talks with new outfits
  - Decision taken in light of mushrooming of splinter rebel groups          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                                     
	New Delhi, July 15: Union home minister P. Chidambaram has ruled out talks with any new splinter group of militant outfits in the Northeast.         
	It was decided that in the light of new splinter groups rising, there would be no more golden handshakes with militants. They can take benefits of the surrender policy for militants in the Northeast, a senior home ministry official told The Telegraph today.        
	Chidambaram is understood to have conveyed his decision at a meeting of top officials of the Union home ministry, police and Assam home department on July 9, a day after the anti-talks faction of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) blew up tracks in Kokrajhar district. The ceasefire offer, however, is open to the anti-talks faction of the NDFB led by Ranjan Daimary, who was arrested recently, and Ulfa.         
	The decision not to open talks with any new splinter group was taken after consultations with former intelligence bureau chief P.C. Haldar. He is the Centres representative engaged in negotiations with pro-talks faction of the NDFB, the United Peoples Democratic Solidarity (UPDS), the Dima Halam Daogah (DHD-Dilip Nunisa) and the DHD (Jewel Garlosa) in Assam and the Achik National Volunteers Council (ANVC) in the Garo hills of Meghalaya.         
	At present, 10 groups in the region are under suspension of operations or in ceasefire agreements with Delhi. However, every time the Centre negotiates with a group, other splinter groups crop up. In case of ceasefire agreements with militants, the latter expect financial help from New Delhi.                           
	However, doubts persist whether Chidambarams decision will actually help resolve the Catch-22 situation. Now that you have begun talks with the DHD (J), will there be talks with the Hill Tigers Force also? asked an official. The HTF was raised soon after the government decided to negotiate with the DHD (J).         
	We need to pause and take a look at what has been the result of engagement with militants in the Northeast, the official said.         
	In no state except Mizoram, which has remained peaceful following the peace pact with Mizo National Front in 1986, has violence stopped. In Nagaland, a number of outfits continue to operate despite peace accords. In Assam, too, different leaders of Ulfa claim to be fit enough to hold talks. In Manipur, there are groups that have as many as half-a-dozen factions. Experts are not sure if the Bodo areas will remain peaceful even after the BTC is engaged in negotiations and seemingly brought into the mainstream.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 19: Governor M.K. Narayanan summoned home secretary Ardhendu Sen and police chief Bhupinder Singh after the Shilda massacre in the backdrop of reports that intelligence inputs about Maoist activity in the area were ignored.        
	The meeting at the Raj Bhavan took place on Wednesday when the two officials appeared to have contradicted each other. The home secretary had said an investigationwould be conducted to fix responsibility but Singh had insisted that it would not be an effort to nail the guilty.        
	Raj Bhavan officials confirmed to The Telegraph that a closed-door meeting did take place among the three in the evening.        
	The governor has the authority to call state officials over but in Narayanans case the move assumes greater than usual significance because of his experience as the national security adviser and a life-long intelligence official.        
	When Narayanan was picked for Bengal, it was thought that his background would help the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in its campaign against Maoists.        
	The governor had expressed a deep sense of anguish at the massacre of 24 policemen at Shilda in West Midnapore at the hands of Maoists, much in the manner of his predecessor Gopalkrishna Gandhi. But the meeting with the state officials was more in sync with his role in the Delhi security establishment.        
	Unlike Gopal Gandhi, who had succeeded in often rubbing the government the wrong way, the part Narayanan played by summoning the officials should sit well with Bhattacharjee.        
	It is not known if the governor had something to say to the two about their conflicting statements, but the chief ministers intervention yesterday to end the impression that the administration was speaking in two voices does not seem to have had effect.        
	Singh today contradicted the home secretarys statement that the government had received intelligence about a Maoist build-up in Shilda hours before the massacre and that the police chief was aware of it.        
	Singh blew up: Am I mad? Do you people think that I will sit on intelligence inputs that an attack would be launched on a police camp or that a huge mobilisation would lead to it? That too knowing full well that it would mean a loss of lives? Most irresponsible statements are being made. If you say that the home secretary had talked about it, why dont you ask him?         
	Singh said any government agency in possession of such information should have alerted the Shilda Eastern Frontier Rifles camp instead of waiting to pass it on to him.

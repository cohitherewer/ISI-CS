The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Short is sour in winter House
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Short is sour in winter House
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 26: The three-day winter session of the state Assembly, beginning December 28, is billed to be a mere formality, with the second supplementary budget its only big business.         
	Legislators will barely get two hours to raise questions over problems plaguing their constituencies and half an hour to pose questions to the chief minister over issues of public importance.        
	During this very brief House session, the government is also likely to regulate the ordinance promulgated some time ago to extend the limit of the Jharkhand Contingency Fund (JCF) to Rs 750 crore from Rs 150 crore. According to sources, the state will introduce the ordinance, promulgated in view of withdrawing funds to fight drought, on December 28, but the new limit will be effective only till March 31.         
	The government has two options to get funds for projects not having provisions in the budget when the House is not in session. It is either by re-appropriating (diverting unused funds) or providing funds through supplementary budget. The government invokes the JCF when the above options arent available.         
	The second supplementary budget, also to be tabled on December 28, is likely to have provisions for Rs 350 crore, received from the Centre, under the integrated action plan, at the instance of the Planning Commission for 14 Naxalite-affected districts.        
	The state has planned to use a major portion of this fund (Rs 25 crore to each of the 14 districts) for desilting existing ponds and water reservoirs. The funds will also be used to set up tube wells with sockpits, said deputy chief minister and finance minister Hemant Soren.         
	Businesses may happen, but members will not be able to ask marked questions, which require prior notice of 14 days. They will get two hours for raising questions on January 3 and 4. No legislation is on the agenda right now, a source said.         
	No wonder, the Opposition, whose pressure prompted the Munda government to call the session, is not enthused.         
	We wanted a meaningful session, which would have been possible only if it were longer, say at least a week. The current session is mere eyewash, said JVM legislature party leader Pradeep Yadav. So, we may take a decision to boycott the House on December 28 in consultation with other Opposition parties, he added.        
	A senior ruling party member, requesting anonymity, however, said that the Oppositions fresh stand was absurd. There is no constitutional obligation to hold the session of the House. Under the Constitution, the gap between two sessions should not be more than 180 days. So, the government, which summoned the session on September 14 to seek the vote of trust, could have straightaway held the budget session. It was only to silence the Opposition that Munda summoned the House, he added.        
	Speaker C.P. Singh said that the Opposition could still utilise the short session to the advantage of the people of their constituencies. It is not a question of whether the House is for three or 13 days. It is the question of intention of how the members use the given time.        
	He, however, added that the government must ensure that the House was in session for at least 50 days in a year.

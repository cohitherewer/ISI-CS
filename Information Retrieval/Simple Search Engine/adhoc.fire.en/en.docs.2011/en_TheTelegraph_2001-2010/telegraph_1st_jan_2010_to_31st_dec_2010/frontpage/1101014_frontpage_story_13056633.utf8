	Oct. 13: They took huge swallows of fresh air and they feasted on the countless stars overhead.        
	Then they spoke of God.        
	Ive been near God but Ive also been near the devil. God won, said Mario Seplveda, the second of the 23 miners who had been winched out of a 69-day dungeon that could have been their tomb nearly half-a-mile below the surface in Chile.        
	At 2am Indian time on Thursday, 10 miners were still trapped in the gold and copper mine as a transfixed world and an electrified Chile kept track through every conceivable media tool.        
	An hour before Seplveda left the rescue capsule in a kind of victory dance, Florencio Avalos had emerged from the missile-like chamber and smiled broadly. He hugged his sobbing seven-year-old son and wife and then President Sebastian Pinera, a conservative billionaire who has staked his presidency on the rescue mission.        
	When Avalos stepped out, bystanders broke into a chant of the countrys name  Chi! Chi! Chi! Le! Le! Le!        
	Avalos was followed an hour later by Seplveda, the most ebullient of the group. He hugged his wife, handed out souvenir rocks from the mine, punched fists with the crowd and led an encore: Chi! Chi! Chi! Le! Le! Le!         
	No one in recorded history has survived as long trapped underground as the 33 men. For the first 17 days, no one even knew if they were alive.        
	Their perseverance, discipline and collaboration riveted the globe with a universal story of human struggle and the enormously complex operation to rescue them.         
	As each subsequent miner emerged alive and smiling, the world seemed to celebrate but also to hold its collective breath that all 33 would make it out as effortlessly as the first ones.         
	 The rescue progressed with remarkable speed  beginning at midnight and sometimes as quickly as once every 40 minutes.        
	The operation moved past the halfway point with the rescue of the 17th miner, a 56-year-old electrician named Omar Reygadas who helped organise life underground. His fourth great-grandchild was born a month after the men were sealed into the mines lower reaches on August 5 when 700,000 tonnes of rock collapsed.        
	The initial phase went so well that the officials abandoned a plan for restricting images of the rescue. A huge Chilean flag that was to obscure the hole from view was moved aside so the hundreds of cameras perched on a hill above could record images.        
	The last miner was slated to be shift foreman Luis Urzua, whose leadership was credited with helping the men endure the 17 days without outside contact.

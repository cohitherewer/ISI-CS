The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hill meet fails, hint of boycott
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Hill meet fails, hint of boycott
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 11: The official-level talks between the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, the Bengal government and the Centre collapsed today over differences on the territory to come under the jurisdiction of the interim authority proposed for the Darjeeling hills.        
	The Morcha even indicated that it might boycott the political level-talks tentatively scheduled for this month end, if the governments did not agree to discuss the question of territory. It also submitted a fresh document to justify its demand for the inclusion of Siliguri and portions of the Dooars and the Terai in the interim set-up.         
	The meeting, a precursor to the second round of political talks, was a non-starter. Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri stood firm on his demand that no talks were possible without the inclusion of Siliguri and the Terai and Dooars in the interim authority. We will go back to Darjeeling and decide whether to participate in the political talks.         
	Bengal home secretary Samar Ghosh said the mandate for todays meeting was a discussion on the powers of the interim authority. A discussion on territory was not part of the mandate. There was no forward movement. We could not discuss anything. He added that the date for next round of political talks could not be fixed and that the talks might be delayed.        
	Home ministry officials said the areas being demanded by the Morcha had substantial tribal and Rajbangshi population.         
	The situation on the ground is quite different from what the Morcha claims about these groups supporting their cause. There is also the issue of the region being a border area and the only corridor connecting India with the northeastern states, said a source.         
	At Writers Buildings in Calcutta, Bengal chief secretary Ardhendu Sen said the talks had not collapsed. The talks did not collapse, only the date for the next round of talks could not be fixed today, he said.         
	Giri said the Morcha was not ready to be part of any discussion which did not include the territory. They will have to discuss the inclusion of Siliguri and the Terai and the Dooars. The Bengal government is backtracking on its previous commitments, he said.        
	Giri said a fresh document had been submitted to the Union home ministry. We have listed the disparities in education and health, the state of the tea gardens and the other problems faced by the people of the Terai and the Dooars, justifying the inclusion of the areas in our proposed interim set-up, he said.

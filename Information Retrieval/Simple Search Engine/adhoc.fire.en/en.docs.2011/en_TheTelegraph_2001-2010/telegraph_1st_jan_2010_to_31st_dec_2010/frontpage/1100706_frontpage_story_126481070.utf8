	Bhopal, Jul 6 (PTI): Former Union Carbide India chairman Keshub Mahindra and four others convicted on June 7 in the Bhopal Gas leak case were today granted bail by a court here.  
	UCIL former Managing Director Vijay Gokhle, former Vice President Kishore Kamdar, former Works Manager J Mukund and former Production Manager S P Choudhry were others granted bail by Chief Judicial Magistrate R V Singh.							   
	Former Plant Superintendent K V Shetty and former Operator S I Qureshi, who were also convicted, did not get bail today as they were not present in the court.  
	 The convicts had filed an appeal in the sessions court against the June 7 verdict which had directed them to seek bail from Chief Judicial Magistrate.

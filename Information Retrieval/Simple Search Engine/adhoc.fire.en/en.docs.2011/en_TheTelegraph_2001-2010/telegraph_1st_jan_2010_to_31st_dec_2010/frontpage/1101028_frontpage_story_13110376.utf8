          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Sunil Gavaskar                                  
	Oct. 27: There was no formal discussion on Sunil Gavaskars ties with the under-fire Team Kochi, at this mornings Indian Premier League (IPL) governing council meeting, but it definitely wasnt a non-issue either.        
	Incidentally, with as many as five members, including chairman Chirayu Amin, absent, the meeting was chaired by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Shashank Manohar.        
	Manohar has been spearheading the clean-up drive, set in motion minutes after IPL III ended, in the very early hours of April 26.         
	According to one of the governing council members, who attended the meeting in Nagpur, the feeling was that Gavaskar, an iconic former India captain, ought to have been transparent.        
	The Gavaskar business wasnt raised at the meeting, but there was an informal discussion and we felt that he should have been transparent. Its clear now that there has been a connection, possibly from before the time Kochi actually won the bid, in March, the governing council member told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking soon after the meeting ended, with Kochi getting a further 30 days to get its house in order, the governing council member added: One of the Gaikwads (co-owners) has been quoted as saying that it was under Gavaskars guidance that they ventured into the IPL. To the best of our knowledge, theres been no denial of that claim.        
	Gavaskar, then, had some ties with the Kochi people even though he was a paid member of the (old) governing council. He ought to have kept it in the loop. Moreover, theres the more important issue of ethics.... What exactly did he do? Gavaskar should not have been silent, when the world was speculating on his involvement.        
	While Gavaskar has rubbished talk that he has a stake, he hasnt denied what one of the Gaikwads said, on Monday. That hasnt gone unnoticed.        
	The governing council was reconstituted as recently as late last month, with absolutely nobody getting a rupee.         
	Gavaskar and two other former players  Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Ravi Shastri  were each paid Rs 1 crore (after the deduction of taxes) annually from the IPLs debut season, 2007-08, till the governing council got reconstituted.        
	Besides Amin, the BCCIs president-elect and secretary, Narayanswamy Srinivasan, treasurer Mohinder Pandove, Arun Jaitley and Mohinder Amarnath were the absentees.        
	Amin and Jaitley, it seems, stayed away as theyre on the disciplinary committee looking into the charges against Lalit Kumar Modi, who was the IPL chairman when Kochi won the bid.                    
	Modi has challenged the composition of the disciplinary committee (Jyotiraditya Scindia is its third member) and the matter is in the Supreme Court.         
	Apparently, Srinivasan didnt show up as he continues to be questioned on the conflict of interest over the Chennai Super Kings.        
	Pandove wasnt able to get away from existing commitments, at short notice, while Amarnath didnt take calls till rather late in the evening. One can only guess why he was absent.        
	The BCCI, for the record, remained silent on why almost half the governing council stayed away.         
	Rajeev Shukla, a BCCI vice-president, joint-secretary Sanjay Jagdale, Ajay Shirke, Ranjib Biswal, Anurag Thakur and Ravi Shastri were present on Manohars home turf.

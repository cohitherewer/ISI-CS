          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, March 2: The alleged chief of the Maoist guerrilla wing in Bengal was caught from a busy bus stop at Behala tonight, plainclothesmen apparently walking up to him, uttering his name and confirming his identity from his startled expression.        
	Venkateshwar Reddy, known as Telugu Deepak because of his Andhra Pradesh origins, was arrested as he stepped out of a bus at Sarsuna in Behala to meet a source.        
	The police claimed that Deepak, an alleged explosives expert entrusted with training Lalgarhs tribal youths in guerrilla warfare, was present among those who attacked the Shilda camp where 24 policemen were killed.        
	The 42-year-old Deepak is said to be a state committee member of the CPI (Maoist) and close to rebel leader Kishan who also hails from Andhra.        
	 The presence of two senior Andhra leaders in Bengal confirms how Maoists have taken shelter in perceived soft states such as Bengal after the late Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy had launched a crackdown in the southern state.        
	The police said a Maoist source had provided specific information about the arrival of Deepak from the forests around Lalgarh. He had taken a train from Jhargram to Howrah and then boarded a bus to Sarsuna.        
	We had information on his appearance, his clothes and the colour of the bag he was carrying. We were waiting for him to get off the bus, an officer said.         
	CID officers said around 15 plainclothesmen waited at the Sarsuna bus stop from 6pm. Since the bus stop is crowded till late at night, the group did not draw attention. The officers had also been shown footage, which the CID had managed to capture from arrested Maoists, that showed Deepak moving around in the forests of Lalgarh.        
	When Deepak got off the bus, one of the officers went up to him and uttered his name. It was Deepaks reflex action that provided the final confirmation, an officer said. As soon as he heard the name Deepak, he whirled around and stared at the officer in disbelief.         
	The other policemen then encircled Deepak, took him to a Sumo parked nearby and whisked him away to the CIDs Bhabani Bhawan headquarters.        
	Kalyan Sengupta, the president of the Sarsuna Byabsayee Samiti, was at the bus stop chatting with friends when the arrest took place. We saw a person in jeans and shirt suddenly being encircled by about 15 people, Sengupta said. This man was smartly dressed. He did not protest as the policemen caught him by his hand and led him away.        
	Sengupta said one of the policemen told him that the person was a Maoist. I did not know Maoists looked so sober and decent, he added.        
	The police still do not know whom Deepak had come to meet in the city.        
	An officer said Deepak had left Andhra four years ago when it became too hot there because of the crackdown. In a way, he did what his mentor Kishen did.        
	In Andhra, too, Deepak was a CPI (Maoist) state committee member. After leaving Andhra, Deepak reached Jharkhand and met Kishan who was already operating there. Thereafter, Deepak was brought to Bengal and, gradually, he took charge of Maoist operations here.        
	The police said Deepak grew up in Guntur and was studying in a polytechnic when he joined the Maoist movement at the age of 17.

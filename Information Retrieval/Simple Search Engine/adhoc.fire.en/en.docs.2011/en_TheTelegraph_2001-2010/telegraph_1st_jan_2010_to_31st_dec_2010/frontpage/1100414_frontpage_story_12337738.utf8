   Party wants minister to explain IPL details          SANJAY K. JHA                                     
	New Delhi, April 13: Few Congress leaders stood up to defend Shashi Tharoor today with the party adopting a hands-off policy till an internal enquiry gave a clearer picture of the IPL controversy.        
	Let him explain. Let others explain what is the truth, said Janardhan Dwivedi, the Congresss media department chairperson.        
	The crux of the matter is whether any impropriety could be attached to the minister for associating himself with a consortium that gave away free equity to Sunanda Pushkar, whom Tharoor said in a statement today that he knows well.        
	Many senior leaders feel that Tharoor is in real trouble this time as the issue is not merely of verbal impropriety and his continuance as minister is untenable now.         
	The majority view in the party is that Tharoor will have to go, either now or during a cabinet shuffle a few months from now. If Tharoor survives, other ministers will also demand immunity.        
	Tharoor, known for unconventional tweets, has survived many a storm in the past. One factor that can still earn him a breather is the antipathy of the Congress leadership towards Lalit Modi, who leaked the Kochi IPL shareholding pattern on Twitter and was accused of trying to scuttle the deal by the minister. Modis proximity to BJP leaders could also be a straw Tharoor can cling on to.        
	Sonia Gandhi met Tharoors immediate boss, foreign minister S.M. Krishna, this morning, triggering speculation about the junior ministers fate. Krishna asserted that the meeting was fixed four days ago and had nothing to do with Tharoor, but party sources attached much significance to the meeting.        
	Party MP Rajiv Shukla, who is also a BCCI vice-president, was called to 10 Janpath in the morning. Shukla, too, claimed Tharoor was not discussed but sources said he briefed the party president on the IPL episode.        
	Officially, the Congress remained circumspect. We have nothing to comment. Many things happen in sports and no political party can get embroiled in it, Dwivedi said.        
	He refused to respond to the charges of ministerial misconduct, indicating that the party did not want to stick its neck out without getting adequate information.        
	The cautious approach came barely an hour after party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed dismissed the BJPs demand for Tharoors resignation as absurd.        
	Although Ahmed, too, contended that it was for the cricket administration to find out if irregularities had been done, he said there was nothing wrong in a minister extending support to efforts for getting a team for his state.         
	But Congress leaders did not share Ahmeds opinion in off-the-record conversations, suggesting that there was a clear element of impropriety potent enough to cause embarrassment to both the government and the party.        
	The Congress has publicly reprimanded Tharoor in the past, but it is moving cautiously this time as the involvement of money and a woman has made the matter extremely sensitive.        
	One leader said: The IPL is a popular event and millions of people are passionately associated with it. People will feel dejected if muck involving ministers and politicians surfaces. We have to assess the situation carefully.         
	The budget session of Parliament is resuming day after tomorrow, and the Opposition is bound to hit the ground all guns blazing.        
	The Congress has so far not faced a direct corruption charge in its six-year tenure and would not like to blot its record. Many leaders believe this cannot be done unless Tharoor is sacrificed.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs absence from the country has also complicated the matter. Now it is for the Prime Minister to decide if he wants to give another chance to the flamboyant minister.

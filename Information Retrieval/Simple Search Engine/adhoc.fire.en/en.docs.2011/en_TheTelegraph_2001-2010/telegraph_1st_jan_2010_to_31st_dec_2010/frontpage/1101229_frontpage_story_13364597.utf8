The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Chief minister, look over your shoulder
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Chief minister, look over your shoulder
          ARNAB GANGULY                                               
	Calcutta, Dec. 28: Mamata Banerjee is living up to her status as shadow chief minister. She has been shadowing the chief minister everywhere.        
	It will take another few months to find out if she can chase Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee down to his chamber at the Writers Buildings, but the Trinamul chief has decided to keep snapping at his heels right up to the Assembly polls.        
	Since October, Mamata has tailed Bhattacharjee from Midnapore to Metro Channel, holding rallies at the same venue at least four times.         
	Dum Dum will be the fifth. The chief minister addressed a meeting on the central jail grounds there yesterday; Mamata will hold one at the same spot on Thursday. Trinamul sources said the trend would continue till the polls.        
	This was decided by the core committee. It isnt just about the chief minister. Wherever the CPM holds a street-corner meeting or a big rally, well hold a meeting too, Partha Chatterjee said.        
	Another Trinamul leader said the strategy was aimed at piling pressure on the CPM at a time its leaders have been crowing about a turnaround at rallies. We had to call their bluff, so Mamata decided to follow the chief minister wherever he went.         
	The game of chase the chief minister began after Bhattacharjee addressed a rally at Midnapore town on October 2. Mamata was there four days later. Twice, though, it has been the other way round with Bhattacharjee playing catch-up with his rival in Purulia and Rajarhat  perhaps lending credence to the view that its the chief minister who has been left chasing the game.        
	Our main aim is to counter the chief ministers claims. The other objective is holding larger rallies to prove Mamata has the bigger mass appeal, a Trinamul insider said. He claimed Mamata had proved this at the back-to-back meetings in Bankura, Burdwan and the Metro Channel.        
	CPM leaders have been dodging queries on this, conveniently pointing to the lack of a scientific method to compare turnout figures. Mohammad Salim, though, has his own reading of what he dubs a unique situation.         
	Earlier, we would say Trinamul doesnt have a policy. Now it appears it doesnt have a programme, either, he scoffed. It seems as though the Left is deciding the venues and dates of Opposition meetings.                    
	 We have a rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds on February 13. Let them follow suit.

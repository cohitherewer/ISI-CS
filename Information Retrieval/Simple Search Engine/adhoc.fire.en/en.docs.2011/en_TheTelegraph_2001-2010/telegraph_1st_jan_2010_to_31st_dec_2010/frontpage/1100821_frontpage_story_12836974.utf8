	Aug. 20: Pakistan has accepted $5 million in aid from India for flood victims over a week after the offer was made by New Delhi and after some very public nudging by the US.        
	Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in New York the government had accepted the money from India but the admission was made as if under duress. Qureshi, who was at Asia Society, faced persistent questioning from the Indian media as to why Pakistan was not accepting the Indian offer.        
	After being prodded several times, he announced that Pakistan had accepted the offer. In Islamabad, however, the foreign office expressed no knowledge of the decision.        
	I can share with you that the government of Pakistan has agreed to accept the Indian offer, Qureshi said, thanking Manmohan Singh for the positive gesture.        
	Its highly appreciated by Pakistan and we have recognised it. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called Prime Minister Gilani and they have exchanged views on the evolving flood situation in Pakistan, Qureshi, in New York for a special meeting of the UN on the Pakistan floods, said.        
	Terming it a very welcome initiative, Qureshi said he was looking forward to further engagement with Singh to build confidence and to bridge the trust deficit between the countries.        
	The floods have affected about one-fifth of Pakistans territory, straining its civilian government as it also struggles against al Qaida and Taliban violence. At least 6 million people have been left homeless and the economic cost is expected to run into billions of dollars.        
	With Pakistan dilly-dallying, the US had yesterday prodded it to accept Indias offer, saying politics should have no role in disaster response. We are not playing politics. Let me acknowledge that the minister for external affairs, Mr S.M. Krishna, called me in Islamabad and he expressed sympathy and offered assistance to Pakistan, Qureshi said.        
	In New Delhi, foreign ministry spokesperson Vishnu Prakash said India was willing to send more aid. We welcome the decision by Pakistan to accept the offer of assistance that has been made.        
	He dubbed it a goodwill offer made to express solidarity with the people of Pakistan, hit by the worst floods in 80 years.        
	We believe India and Pakistan share a common destiny it is a common interest for both our countries to work towards having a cordial and co-operative relationship.        
	In Washington, US state department spokesperson P.J. Crowley said the Obama administration wanted Pakistans neighbours to do more. We want to see Pakistans neighbours step up and contribute significantly to Pakistans future, he said.

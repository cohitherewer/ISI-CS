          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit with Abhishek Bachchan at the launch of the Earth Hour 2010 programme in New Delhi on March 10                                  
	New Delhi, March 28: Abhishek Bachchans imprint as ambassador of a global environment movement was obliterated from an event here attended by chief minister Sheila Dikshit yesterday, sparking a fresh political row surrounding one of Bollywoods best-known families.        
	The actors posters and a video message from him on Earth Hour 2010 were a scheduled part of a mega World Wild Fund (WWF) for Nature show at India Gate here, but were removed hours before the event.         
	The actors father, superstar Amitabh Bachchan, linked the alarming development to the controversy over his presence  on invitation by the Congress-led Maharashtra government  at the launch of new lanes of the Bandra-Worli Sealink in Mumbai last week.         
	Dikshit denied any knowledge of why the Abhishek video or posters were removed, but a WWF-India source indicated that the organisers were influenced by concerns articulated by the Delhi government. There were indications that the Delhi government was concerned over Abhisheks presence  even virtually  at the event, the source said. WWF-India has not issued any formal statement on the controversy.        
	In a post on his blog yesterday evening, Amitabh wondered whether the decision not to show Abhisheks video message and to remove his posters were part of a larger pattern.        
	A few hours before the show was to start apparently the audio visual featuring Abhishek has been asked to be removed and banner posters bearing his photograph as ambassador have been stopped from being displayed, he wrote.        
	Abhishek was disappointed, especially since he had worked late into the night where he was shooting out of town to accommodate this (programme), Amitabh said in the post.        
	Amitabh also uploaded on his blog invitations he has received from different Maharashtra ministers  including the one to the sea link event  and has asked readers whether he should stop attending such programmes.        
	His presence at the sea link inauguration on March 24 in the presence of Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan had led to protests within the Congress. Chavan later said he would not have attended had he known Amitabh had been invited, even though large advertisements for the event clearly mentioned the actors name as an invitee.         
	Chavan avoided bumping into the superstar again by showing up at a literature event in Pune yesterday. The chief minister was scheduled to attend it today  when Amitabh was to come too.        
	The official reason for the Congresss reluctance to share public space with the Big B is his endorsement of Gujarat tourism. The Congress is a critic of Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, accused of failing to stop the anti-Muslim riots in the state in 2002.        
	Earlier this month, the same reason was cited by the CPM-led government in Kerala to drop Amitabh from its tourism-promotion programme.         
	The Bachchans have shared a tumultuous relation with Congress chief Sonia Gandhis family  and the BJP today suggested this was the reason why Amitabh was being ill-treated.

	Washington, April 7: Sitar maestro Ravi Shankars 90th birthday is being celebrated today in the US  where his first American concert was held 53 years ago  with pomp and artistic extravagance of the kind reserved for an American hero.         
	Concerts are to be held later this evening at several American cities and tributes have been paid, wishing him a happy life long enough to be a centenarian by April 2020.         
	Shankar was planning to spend the day at a lush California coastal resort but he cancelled his arrival there at the eleventh hour. No reason was given for the cancellation.         
	Asia Society, which presented Shankars first US concert at New Yorks Carnegie Hall in 1957 and his first American tour four years later, commemorated its more than half century-long association with the maestro on his birthday.         
	We look forward to celebrating Ravijis 100th birthday, and we wish him a happy and healthy life forever, said Asia Society president Vishakha Desai.         
	He enchanted American audiences with his electrifying sitar playing even before the Beatles sought his guidance and partnership. Asia Society is proud to have had a warm connection with Raviji for more than 50 years.         
	In Chicago this evening, there will be a screening of the 2002 documentary, Ravi Shankar: Between Two Worlds. Later there will be a concert and other events to mark the occasion.         
	In Los Angeles, Shankar is scheduled to perform with his daughter Anoushka at the Walt Disney Concert Hall on April 26 and solo on October 20. This hall is the new home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.         
	In the city, celebrations have been planned throughout this week, including a concert on Saturday.         
	Beatle George Harrisons legatees today recalled his legendary association with Shankar.         
	Ravi Shankar shares a life-long friendship with George Harrison, starting the moment they first met in 1966. Over the years, Ravi and George would collaborate on three albums composed by Ravi Shankar  Shankar Family and Friends, Music Festival Of India and Chants Of India  in addition to their work together on the historic Concert For Bangladesh, a statement said.

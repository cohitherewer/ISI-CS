          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                               
	Ranchi, May 27: Sonia Gandhi is understood to have advocated a wait and watch policy till May 31, the day chief minister Shibu Soren is scheduled to prove his strength in the Assembly, indicating that the Congress will not make any move to try and form an alternative government for now.        
	At a meeting held at her residence in Delhi with senior Congress leaders, including a few from Jharkhand, she said she would rather wait and see how the JMM fared in the trust vote and then make a fresh assessment of the situation before deciding on anything.        
	Among those who attended todays meeting were Sonias political adviser Ahmed Patel, party general secretary Oscar Fernandes, Jharkhand incharge K. Keshav Rao, state unit chief Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu and leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Rajendra Prasad Singh.        
	According to sources, the state leaders tried their best to impress upon Sonia that imposing Presidents Rule again and paving the way for fresh Assembly elections would only ruin the partys image.         
	They argued that the people of the state were not prepared for another round of elections and that Congress should take the lead to work out a viable alternative. They also complained that development work in Jharkhand had come to grinding halt with central schemes in a shambles.         
	But, the Congress president stuck to her views.         
	We will be waiting till May 31. Now we are discussing ways and means to efficiently face the new challenges ahead, Singh said over telephone from Delhi.        
	In Ranchi, JMM leaders late in the evening held a meeting with the Ajsu leadership to discuss the confidence vote.         
	JMM legislature party leader Hemant Soren reportedly asked Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto to support the Shibu Soren government on May 31. Mahto promised Hemant of his support. Being a part of the government led by Shibu Soren, Ajsu is duty-bound to support Soren on the day of the trust vote, said Mahto.

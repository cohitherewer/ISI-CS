                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Clean chit for Anil sabotage suspects 
          SADAF MODAK                             Anil Ambani                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 30: Two men accused of tampering with Anil Ambanis chopper last year have been acquitted by a sessions court in Mumbai.         
	On April 23, 2009, Ambani had expressed fear for his life after a routine maintenance check on his helicopter revealed that the filler cap of the Bell 412 had been tampered with and pebbles and gravel pushed inside.         
	Police accused Uday Warikar and Balraj Thewar, employees of Airworks Indian Engineering, the company that was maintaining the helicopter since October 2006, of sabotage.         
	During investigations, they had concluded that a dispute between the two helpers and the company management had provoked the crime.         
	Additional sessions judge M.V. Kulkarni today dismissed the prosecutions argument for lack of evidence.         
	Based on the report submitted by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the judge observed that though there were pebbles and gravel found in the filler cap, there was no damage done for the chopper to crash. There was also no evidence to show that the two accused had tampered with the chopper, defence lawyer Vinayak Bichu said.         
	Bichu had argued that the company management itself could have tampered with the chopper to sack its workers. Immediately after the incident, the company had removed 52 of its workers, he said.         
	The pebbles and gravel were noticed by an Airworks senior technician, Bharat Borge, when the chopper was being serviced in the companys hangar. This was one day before Ambani was to take a 13-minute flight from Mahalaxmi to Navi Mumbai. The pilot wrote a complaint to the then chief minister, Ashok Chavan, calling it an attempt to murder by possible business rivals.         
	Four days after the complaint, Bharat Borge was found dead near a railway crossing in the western suburbs of the city. The judge observed that the investigation into Borges mysterious death was not proper. Four Reliance employees were interrogated but railway police gave them a clean chit and described the death as an accident.

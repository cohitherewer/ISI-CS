          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Amit Shah being taken to court. (PTI)                          
	Ahmedabad, July 25: Former Gujarat minister Amit Shah emerged from hiding to make a sudden appearance at his party headquarters today before driving to the CBI office in a surrender drama sources said was aimed at rallying support ahead of civic elections.        
	A CBI judge sent the 46- year-old BJP leader, who resigned yesterday, to two weeks judicial remand in Sabarmati jail after the agency refrained from seeking his custody. ( )        
	The surrender came on a day the Congress said chief minister Narendra Modi should also be prepared to face uncomfortable questions.        
	Shah, absconding since July 22 after the CBI summoned him for questioning in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, turned up at the Gujarat BJP headquarters just as state unit chief R.C. Faldu began a media briefing.        
	Faldu said he was pleasantly surprised, but sources claimed the sudden appearance was meant as a signal to party workers to go on the warpath ahead of civic polls in six cities, including Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat, between October and December. The BJP controls all the six civic bodies.        
	Shah, charged with murder, extortion and kidnapping, appeared relaxed. Im innocent, he said.        
	He said the Congress was misusing the CBI for electoral gain in Gujarat where the party had been out of power for 20 years. This is their only recourse to destabilise the Modi government, he said.         
	Then, accompanied by a small group of supporters, he drove to the CBIs Gandhinagar office, where he was arrested and taken to the residence of judge A.Y. Dave, who sent him to judicial custody. Sources said Shah could apply for bail tomorrow.        
	Sources said Shahs apparent confidence stemmed from the support of Modi and the party, which had spurned a lunch invite from the Prime Minister to express solidarity.        
	Modi, who had cleverly exploited Sonia Gandhis famous maut ka saudagar (merchant of death) comment in the 2007 state elections, has slammed the Congress for glorifying a criminal called Sohrabuddin. The BJP today staged a silent march in the city.        
	Congress spokesman Shakeel Ahmed said the BJP was nervous. Shah was only a minister of state. The transfers of many IPS officers were made by Narendra Modi. It is our understanding that these uncomfortable questions will be asked. Modi will have to answer them, he told PTI.

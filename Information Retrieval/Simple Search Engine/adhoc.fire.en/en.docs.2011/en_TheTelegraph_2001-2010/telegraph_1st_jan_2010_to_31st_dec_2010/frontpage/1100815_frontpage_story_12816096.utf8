	New Delhi, Aug 16 (PTI): It will be another 10 days before the Commonwealth Games theme song is officially launched, but Oscar-winning composer A R Rahman today promised it would be worth the wait as his Yaaro India bula liya would be unlike anything that has happened before.        
	Rahman said the song would go beyond Shakiras chart-buster for this years soccer World Cup Waka Waka. But all have to wait for the launch as Rahman is still giving some final touches.        
	I have been working on the song for the past six months. It is in my voice with a chorus and I promise that it will be a big part of the celebration and will be unlike anything that has happened before in India, the celebrated musician told reporters.        
	Rahman, however, refused to give details about the song beyond the opening line Yaaro India bula liya, saying it would be better if it is launched properly.I cant reveal much because I have to tweak the lyrics a bit and add some sound elements. But the song is about India, about energy, winning and not giving up. We want the crowd to sing along with us at the opening ceremony. It is simple but not simplistic, he said.        
	When asked whether the song will manage to overshadow Shakiras popular football World Cup anthem Waka Waka, Rahman said it is exactly no Waka Waka. It is not Waka Waka. We wanted to go beyond it. It is complex, difficult to explain but I am sure you will like it when you hear it, he added.Rahman has also planned an orchestra and a dedication to the countrys cultural heritage and Mahatma Gandhi.         
	Rahman said that he was initially apprehensive whether the Group of Ministers will like the song but they liked the song.I was a little bit apprehensive if they will like it because the Group of Minister consist of aged people but they all liked and approved it, he said.        
	Organising committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi said the theme will make every Indian proud.The GOM (Group of Ministers) gave us their consent in the 26th meeting yesterday and I am sure Rahmans song will make every Indian happy and it will spread awareness, he said.        
	The opening ceremony will have Rahman performing live. Filmmaker Shyam Benegal, who heads the CWG cultural committee, was also present along with noted dancer Shovana Narayan, creative head of the committee Bharat Bala and director of Wizcraft International Entertainment, Viraf Sarkari.

	My Dear Mamata Maam,               
	Im a student of Class V. My school is closed now for Christmas, the biggest festival for many of us in Calcutta, which comes but only once in a whole year.         
	This is the happiest time for me. No exams, only new clothes and cakes and cookies, bright winter sunshine and smiling faces everywhere. But today, I feel like crying.        
	My mother was supposed to take me shopping. Not the shopping we do through the year but something special. We were to go to New Market.         
	I was supposed to help Mom pick the Christmas tree and choose its make-up  the red stars, the golden balls, the ribbons, the little boxes that hang from the leaves....        
	There was more to buy  the streamers, the hooters, the cone caps and the Santa outfit for my cousin. We had to order the big cake with wafers that mom had promised me. Even my Moms mother, my grandmother, used to take her to New Market for shopping before Christmas.        
	But today my mother refused to go. She said a big rally was being held there. All cars and buses are stuck, how can we go there? she said.         
	She was right, I saw pictures on TV. Our chief minister was speaking and many many people were standing or sitting on the road. No vehicle was being allowed nearby. No one could reach New Market.         
	The chief minister spoke angrily and made faces.         
	I was angry, too. But Mom said shed take me to New Market tomorrow and I became excited again. I called Daddy to let him know.         
	Theres a rally at the same place tomorrow as well and there would be an even bigger crowd, he warned. Mom checked the papers and told me its your rally. It means I may not get my cake and Christmas tree at all.        
	Every day, I get stuck in a jam on the way home from school because of someone or the other at Esplanade. I have got used to it. But, please, we dont want that during the happiest time of the year.         
	Maam, you are my only hope. Me, my friends, and all of us know you from newspapers and TV. My elders tell me you are our future, you will bring change.        
	Please, please, dont do then what everyone else does. Please dont block the road tomorrow. Please dont stop children like me and many others from having fun.        
	You like cakes. You gave one to Leander Paes two days ago. I like cakes, too. Then we are like friends.         
	Please dont stop traffic on the eve of Christmas. Im sure theres a better place for your meeting.         
	Please dont make me cry again.              
	Yours        
	An 11-year-old girl in Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tense at the tee, tipple at the table
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tense at the tee, tipple at the table

	It was bonding over beer at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club for KKN presents The Telegraph Golf Cup 2010 in association with Senbo and Ballantines. Tournament director Brandon de Souza raises a toast on the penultimate day.        
	Beer boost        
	Its the only place where you can drink and drive... the golf carts! After a good game, everyone headed to the 3rd Shamiana for beer teamed with Chicken Breast Cutlets, Chicken Rolls and Vegetable Cutlets. The best thing is free Kingfishers  the idea being, youve had a bad enough round so have one on us!        
	And while we keep talking about six packs, most of the golfers have family packs!        
	Fair weather        
	The weather was lovely and we had over 90 people playing their rounds. Some teams actually had a cheering brigade on the sidelines. The ladies were also on view for a change  although only five are playing. The top three scores among the ladies were given prizes. And we may give prizes to the men who have come with their wives because they are on their best behaviour!        
	The mood...        
	Has moved from trivial to tense. Some have dug themselves into a hole so deep that even an elevator cant get them out.        
	The rules are stricter now, if youre in contention you have to play someone whos in contention. So the teams in contention are worried  because were putting all the leading teams together.        
	Friday will be the final round. Only the bravest would pick a winner with four teams bunched together on Day 3  South City Projects, Senbo-Blue, Orson Holdings and Emaar MGF.        
	Down to the wire        
	Bunny Lakshman Singh will have to commit harakiri to lose from the position the team finds itself in. After Akhilesh Chitlangias good round of 72, Madhya Bharat Papers Ltd is back in the frame. And they say golf has kept more people sane than psychiatrists have!        
	Dream round        
	Raghav Khaitan of South India Projects scored a 45 simply amazing. His was the dream round of the day. If he carries on like this, no one will want to play golf with him!        
	Its like the joke about this wife who was caught sleeping with her husbands friend and so the husband shot his friend. And the wife said: If you carry on like this, youll have no friends left!        
	Surprise of the day        
	Fatty Sanjeev Mehra at 38 points. A lot of people get confused when they see him but he makes sure size does matter. He unleashed the deft touch of a magician around the greens even though he was overtaken by the Khaitans.        
	Young gun        
	Akhilesh Chitlangia, 20, recently returned from Boston University. He did a round of 72 and he should do himself some good before his father overworks him in the business.        
	Party before party        
	Pretty much all the companies who have brought in people from outstation are having parties tonight (Thursday). The big one is the Williamson Magor party at The Royal, with round about 150 people.        
	Busybody        
	If theres anyone whos cashing in on the game, every hour, it has to be Gopal Sahul.        
	Not a boardroom honcho or a man betting on the holes, but the masseur at RCGC.        
	Hes been in demand since 8am because after a good game, everyone wants a rub-down. By 2pm he had massaged eight golfers and still had four hours to go!        
	Ask him if hes happy and Sahul says with a smile, in Hindi: Not till I get eight more customers.        
	Overheard        
	Golfers like to keep it light. Some of the wisecracks heard at the Shamiana were: I dont worry about terrorism, I was married for two years... My wife and I always hold hands, if I let go, she shops... Bachelors should be heavily taxed. Its not fair that some men should be happier than others.                          As told to Karo   Christine Kumar

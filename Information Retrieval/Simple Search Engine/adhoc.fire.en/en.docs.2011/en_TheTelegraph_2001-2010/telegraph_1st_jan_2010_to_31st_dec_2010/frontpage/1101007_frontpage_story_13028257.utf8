	Ranchi, Oct. 6: A banquet and public reception are among the host of programmes that are being arranged for the chief bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, UK-based Archbishop Rowan Williams of Canterbury, during his two-day goodwill mission to Ranchi beginning October 11.        
	In the evening of his arrival, a banquet has been arranged for Archbishop Williams, 60, the highest-ranking non-royal in the United Kingdom, with heads of various ministries of the Church of North India, church leaders and government officials.        
	Early next morning, the Archbishop of Canterbury will hold a holy communion at the 140-year-old St Pauls Cathedral at Bahubazar, the oldest church in Jharkhand built in 1870 in Gothic style.        
	The Archbishop will also unveil plaques at the cathedral and at the SPG Needle School, which are being specially put up to commemorate his historic visit. He is also scheduled to lay the foundation stone of a new diocesan building on the St Margaret School campus.        
	The Archbishop will be accorded a public reception at the St Pauls Cathedral grounds at 10am on October 12. It is very rare for the head of the Anglican Church to visit Ranchi and everything is being done to make his visit a memorable one, Col Shanti Puran Khalkho, spokesman of CNI Church, Ranchi, told The Telegraph.        
	The British High Commission has already informed the state government of the Archbishop of Canterburys proposed visit with a request to arrange for his security during his stay at the state capital from October 11 to 13.         
	We have, on our own, also requested the chief secretary and the home secretary to arrange for security during Archbishop Williamss visit, Khalkho added.        
	In the evening of October 12, the Archbishop, acknowledged as a theological writer, scholar and teacher, will attend a seminar at the Bishop Westcott Boys School, Namkum, on the role of the church and its contribution for the uplift of tribals.         
	That will be followed by a quiet dinner at the guest house of the Bishop Westcott Boys School, where the Archbishop will be staying during his Ranchi visit.        
	Archbishop Williams will leave for Calcutta early in the morning of October 13 en route Nagpur to take part in the 40th anniversary celebrations of the Church of North India.

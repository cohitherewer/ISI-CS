The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Stern steps on table, Delhi backs Omar 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Stern steps on table, Delhi backs Omar

	New Delhi, Aug. 2: Harder measures, including an unannounced shoot-at-sight regime, are in the works for Kashmir.        
	The situation is close to anarchic, it has to be quickly taken in hand, that is the immediate bottom-line, a top government source told The Telegraph today as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held a war-room meeting with Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah and members of the cabinet committee on security (CCS).        
	A role for the army is not on the table yet but it could be called in if the current eruption refuses to ebb. More central forces are being flown and the army is always on standby in the Valley, the source added. The forces will no longer fire only in self-defence, they will fire at every violation of curfew, they will fire at any threat to public property or supply lines.        
	The Centre remains averse to knee-jerk imposition of Presidents Rule, as some in the beleaguered Kashmir police and bureaucracy have begun to suggest, but its patience with spiralling violence is running thin.        
	Politically, sources said, Abdullah continues to enjoy the support of the Centre and the Congress high command but he has been asked to quickly and firmly put a lid on escalating street mayhem.        
	The Union home minister is despatching Intelligence Bureau chief Rajiv Mathur to the Valley to get a first-hand brief of the situation.        
	More than 30 people have died in seven weeks of near continuous protests in the Valley; the most disturbing sign for authorities is that villages have now been engulfed and government property, including police and railway stations, are being put to fire.        
	Another troubling aspect is that neither the state nor the Centre is able to locate the eye of the current storm as a starting point to begin the dousing. Chief minister Abdullah admitted as much.        
	Addressing a media conference between hectic meetings before his return to Srinagar, he said: These are largely leaderless protesters, a number of groups or individuals may be fishing in this, but I dont believe any one in particular is responsible. The fear is things may even have slipped out of the hands of known separatist leaders who the government could have negotiated with.        
	The Telegraph has reliably learnt that backroom negotiations were opened with hardline Hurriyat leader, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, last fortnight using Track II channels. Prominent civil society activists had met Geelani  at time in custody  in a bid to work a way out of the violent impasse. Geelani was later moved to a government hospital and eventually released as part of the Track II effort.        
	But on the second day of his release, Geelani continued to shelter in his hospital ward, unsure of how he will be received by the angered Kashmiri street. It is increasingly evident to many in authority that even if Geelani were to call an end to protests, the mobs will probably not heed him.        
	This is no longer a crisis that is in anybodys hands, a senior Kashmiri bureaucrat said, Shadowy forces are leading it, we do not have a very clear idea who.         
	Abdullah was keen that a political solution be found to the address the problem but stressed that violence must first be over. Sending out whats probably his sternest message yet to protesters, he said: The security forces have so far been restrained but restraint cannot be one-sided. Security forces cannot stand and watch law and order being violated. Curfew will have to be imposed strictly, there is no way around it.        
	He regretted recent loss of lives, but argued that violent protesters were mainly to blame. Much as one wishes not to use force, when people take the law into their hands, there are consequences, often serious and tragic. I know there are angry and alienated sections, but to begin addressing their grievances, the current cycle of violence must end, he said.        
	The uncontained flare-up, he said, had been discussed at length in the meeting with the Prime Minister and CCS members. One of the issues he had raised in the meeting was action on certain political initiatives long in the pipeline because Kashmir needs a political package more than it needs and economic package.        
	Asked to elaborate, Abdullah said: I have been asking for the revocation of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) for a long time, there is the issue of security footprints in the Valley, the rehabilitation of youth who had gone across the LoC, the issue of relief for victims of violence, there is unemployment. But none of these can make any headway in the current situation. The foremost thing now is to bring an end to violence and restore a semblance of calm.        
	Answering another question, Abdullah said he had been in touch with Hurriyat leaders publicly and privately but again pleaded for bringing current tempers down. Some form of normality is vital for any progress, unless the violence comes down nothing will happen.        
	Asked whether he felt stretched in saddle, Abdullah said: We are stretched as far as it is possible to be stretched. We need to augment central forces in the Valley and we need more rapid action forces. I have received assurances on that count from the home minister.

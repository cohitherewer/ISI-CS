          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Dibrugarh, Jan. 10: Over a hundred birds died of suspected pesticide poisoning in a tea estate at Moran in Dibrugarh today.         
	Forest officials said samples of the dead birds would be sent to the forensic laboratory for tests to ascertain the cause.         
	Todays deaths at Tiloijan tea estate comes close on the heels of migratory birds dying inside Kaziranga National Park on Thursday.         
	Tea workers and people living in and around the estate today woke up to find dead birds lying in various parts of the garden. A few were found ill, unable to move.         
	Most of the species which were found to be dead were local birds such as bulbuli, halika and doves. We were surprised to find the birds dead. Some were either limping or just sitting, apparently in a daze, Rajesh Kurmi, a garden labourer, said.         
	A few years ago, several hundred local birds were found dead at the same estate.         
	The state forest department today said it would conduct an inquiry into the incident and action would be initiated if the estate was found to be guilty.         
	The divisional forest officer of Dibrugarh, Anurag Singh, said a team of forest officials led by the range officer of Khowang range, Bhaskar Buragohain, visited the garden and collected samples from dead birds.         
	There is an uncountable number of dead birds lying all over. Local people said some of the garden labourers have also eaten them. If the birds had died because of poisoning, this (consumption of dead birds) could be fatal for human beings too, Buragohain said, after his visit to the garden.         
	The deaths seem to have been caused by pesticide poisoning, but we will know the cause of death only after tests are carried out, he added.         
	NGOs, however, alleged that the forest department personnel do not pay attention to complaints regarding bird deaths.         
	Today the number is high, so there is some activity by the forest department, but overuse of pesticides often kills birds. Sometimes, two or three birds die, sometimes the figure is just one. When we bring these to the notice of forest department personnel, they just ignore it, Pranjal Kishore Goswami, secretary of the Naharpara Borbil Sakha of Aroonudoi Sangbad Gosthi, which works for protection of environment and wildlife, said.         
	It was the members of the Gosthi and another nature group, Natures Care and Friends, who were the first to reach the garden today.

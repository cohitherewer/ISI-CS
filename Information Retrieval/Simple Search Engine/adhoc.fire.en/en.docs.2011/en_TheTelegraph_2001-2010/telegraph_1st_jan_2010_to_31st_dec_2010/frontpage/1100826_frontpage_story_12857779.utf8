The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Spine can reduce degree of pain   Some do stay off Sibal court

   Some do stay off Sibal court           BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                                                     
	Aug. 25: Sorry, Kapil Sibal, you missed a chance to verify the nationality of Amartya Sen and deny him an honorary degree.        
	The Jawaharlal Nehru University has been merrily conferring such honours without standing with folded arms before the Union human resource development ministry.        
	 Something the University of Hyderabad did not have the nerve to do and for which it paid a price by having to break its promise to confer a doctorate degree on chess champion Viswanathan Anand.        
	More sacrilege. Sen is the only Indian so honoured by JNU far. All the other recipients have been foreigners, an incidental detail that did not send the university scurrying to the self-styled masters in the ministry for clearance.        
	The example proves that where there is a will  and spine  universities can find a way out of falling at the feet of nanny ministers.        
	Two days after The Telegraph reported the fiasco around the honorary degree to Anand and highlighted how the State meddles in the affairs of academia, human resource development ministry officials said all 40 central universities are expected to send the list of nominees through the ministry to the Visitor (the President).        
	But senior officials of at least two central universities  JNU and the Banaras Hindu University  told The Telegraph that they do not send proposals for honorary degrees to the HRD ministry.         
	JNU has never sent any list of names of people conferred with honorary degrees. For us, the academic council, the executive council and the chancellor are the authorities for clearing names, said vice-chancellor B.B. Bhattacharya.         
	We do not seek permission from the Visitor on whom to give degrees and not to give. The university enjoys the autonomy to decide such matters, he said.        
	Similar is the practice at BHU. I dont see any reason why the papers should go to the HRD ministry at all, said Subhash Chandra Lakhotia, a member of the academic council of the BHU. The HRD ministry should have returned the document saying it is none of its business, he said.         
	If Sibal, who proclaimed yesterday we are ready to hand over the degree to Anand whenever he wishes, is on the prowl to whip the non-conformists back to the straight and the narrow, an opportunity may be lurking round the corner.        
	JNU has recently decided to confer such degrees on two Nobel laureates, one from Mauritius and another from the US. The executive council has approved their names. As usual, this time also we did not go to the Visitor for approval, an official said.         
	The Presidents office said that it had never questioned Anands citizenship. The Presidents office has not asked for any clarification whatsoever at any stage from the ministry of HRD or from any other source on chess champion Viswanathan Anand with regard to a proposal from the University of Hyderabad for awarding any degree to him, a Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesperson said.         
	The vice-chancellor of the University of Hyderabad, Syed Hasnaian, defended the decision to seek the approval of the Visitor for honouring Anand. The President naturally depends on the HRD and the home ministries to ensure that there are no political issues or criminal background, he said, without making it clear why a university would choose to honour a person whose background needs to be checked by the executive arm of the State.         
	If there is no rule, degrees will be palmed off by universities under control of state governments with political influence, he added.        
	A pleasant surprise: most universities in eastern India do not need to approach governments to take such decisions.        
	In Calcutta University, the state government has no role to play in selection of candidates for conferring honorary degrees. The university selects the candidates in consultation with the chancellor, the governor in this case. CU will be conferring an honorary degree on the king of Bhutan in October.        
	Universities should enjoy complete freedom in conferring honorary degrees. We will strongly oppose if the government tries to encroach on the universitys freedom in this regard, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.         
	In Jadavpur, too, more or less similar rules are followed.        
	An exception in the east seems to be Gauhati University. Vice-chancellor Okhil Kumar Medhi said: In case the person concerned is originally a foreigner, the university needs to seek an approval from the Union ministry for various reasons, including security, particularly for a region like the Northeast.

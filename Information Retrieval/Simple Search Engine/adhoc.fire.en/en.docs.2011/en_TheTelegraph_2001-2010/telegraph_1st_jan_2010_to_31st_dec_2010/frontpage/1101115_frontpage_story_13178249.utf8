          MUZAFFAR RAINA                      Ghulam Mohammad Dar                          
	Srinagar, Nov. 14: The Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota) died six years ago but the first person to be charged under it had to wait till yesterday to get his life back.        
	On Saturday, a Srinagar court dismissed the nine-year-old Pota case against Ghulam Mohammad Dar that had led to the carpet weaver spending 18 months in jail and his family being temporarily evicted from their home.        
	The resident of Srinagars old city was arrested on November 22, 2001, just one day after the NDA government promulgated the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance, which was later turned into an act. The UPA government repealed the law in September 2004 but the case against Dar continued.        
	I thank God that I am a free man now. The decision has come ahead of Id and I could not have expected better, Dar said today. The state police had arrested him for his alleged links with the militant outfit Al Bader. But the judge noted that on November 21, 2001, when the ordinance came into effect, Al Bader had not been declared a banned outfit.        
	Dars arrest under the controversial law had led to an uproar in the Valley, especially after the authorities, using the acts provisions, sealed his home. The family, including his two sons and aged mother, moved briefly to a makeshift shelter on the roadside.        
	The protests, however, forced the government to hand the house back to the family nine days later. Dar, though, had to wait 18 months for bail.        
	I always feared re-arrest. It has been a long-drawn battle for me, he said.

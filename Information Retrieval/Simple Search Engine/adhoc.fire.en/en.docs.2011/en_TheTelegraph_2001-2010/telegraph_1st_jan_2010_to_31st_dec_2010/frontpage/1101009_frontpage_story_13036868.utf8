The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Soren home turf rises in revolt
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Soren home turf rises in revolt
          RAJESH KUMAR PANDEY                              
	Dumka, Oct. 8: Rumblings of discontent within the JMM turned into vociferous protests as those who have been left out of the cabinet gunned for their party chief, Shibu Soren, some threatening to engineer a split in one of Jharkhands oldest parties.        
	Leading the bandwagon of dissidents was JMMs Littipara MLA Simon Marandi. He claimed that Guruji (Soren) had become insignificant in the JMM and that vested interests were running the show.        
	Attempts are being made to sideline senior and dedicated leaders who have made significant contribution in bringing the party to prominence, he said, adding they would no longer remain mute spectators to such grave injustice.        
	It is not that I am worried about myself, the MLA clarified. Senior MLAs from JMMs stronghold Santhal Pargana, like Nalin Soren, Lobin Hembrom and Sita Soren, had more claim to the cabinet.        
	During the JMMs recent party conference in Dumka, Marandi had flashed the Christian card saying the community had to be represented in the new cabinet.        
	Another disgruntled JMM leader, Mandu MLA Teklal Mahto, who was with Simon Marandi in the state capital today to chalk out our strategy after the cabinet expansion, said they had been ignored for several years. This is beyond tolerance, Mahto said, adding that the Arjun Munda government was shortlived. It will last barely a month and a half, he asserted.         
	Mahto said had Jama MLA Sita Soren, the widowed daughter-in-law of the JMM chief, been included in the cabinet, they would have been a bit satisfied, as her husband, late Durga Soren, had done a lot for the party.        
	Both Teklal Mahto and Simon Marandi figured in a sting operation that allegedly showed them demanding money to vote in the Rajya Sabha polls. The vigilance bureau lodged FIRs against them, enough reason for Munda and Shibu Soren to keep them out of the cabinet. Denying the charges, Mahto said: The sting operation does not have any legal status to keep us out of the cabinet.        
	The two senior JMM leaders claimed they had the support of a majority of MLAs. According to sources, at least five MLAs of the 10 from Santhal Pargana  Nalin Soren, Simon Marandi, Lobin Hembrom, Akil Akhtar and Sita Soren  have teamed up with those from Chotanagpur and Kolhan to try and split the party.

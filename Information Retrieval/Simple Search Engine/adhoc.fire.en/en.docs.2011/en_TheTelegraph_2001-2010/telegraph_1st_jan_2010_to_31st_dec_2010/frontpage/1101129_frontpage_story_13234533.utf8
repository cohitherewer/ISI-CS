  - Strategic reasons behind   green nod to power plant        G.S. MUDUR AND SATISH NANDGAONKAR                                                          
	Nov. 28: The Union environment ministry has cleared the proposal for Indias largest nuclear power park at a site on the Konkan coast, signalling how economic and strategic reasons can influence difficult decisions at a time the Centre is proceeding with extreme caution on industrial projects.        
	The ministry announced today that it had granted conditional environmental clearance for the park that envisages six French-made giant nuclear reactors near Jaitapur in Maharashtras Ratnagiri district.        
	Two nuclear reactors, supplied by the French firm Areva, are expected to come up at the site by 2018 in what could be Indias first imports of reactors after the India-US civilian nuclear agreement was reached. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had put the survival of his government on the line to push the deal through.        
	Environment minister Jairam Ramesh, who has been practising Sonia Gandhis policy of giving primacy to disadvantaged groups while deciding the fate of industrial projects, conceded that he had to undertake a delicate balancing act.        
	Four objectives had to be balanced  economic growth, energy security, global diplomacy and environmental factors, Ramesh said in what could become benchmarks for such clearances in the future.        
	Ramesh handed over a seven-page formal letter of clearance to Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan in Mumbai. Chavan, who was closely associated with the Indo-US deal, said: This is indeed a historic day and an emotional moment for me personally since I was part of the Prime Ministers trip to Washington for make-or-break negotiations.        
	The public-sector Nuclear Power Corporation (NPC) will build the project that will initially have two 1,650MW reactors from Areva. The NPC hopes to add four identical reactors at the 938-hectare site for an installed capacity of 9,900MW, nearly double that of Indias existing nuclear power capacity.        
	The environment ministry has laid down 35 conditions to protect the marine environment, fisheries and biodiversity, including Alphonso mango trees, at the project site. The terms specify that the cooling water discharge system should extend beyond 2.2km into the sea.        
	A delicate balancing act has had to be done, Ramesh said. The decision to accord environmental clearance for NPCs Jaitapur power complex has been difficult.        
	Several non-government organisations had petitioned the ministry, citing the fragility of the Western Ghats to oppose the project.        
	But... there are weighty strategic and economic reasons in favour of the grant of environmental clearance now, Ramesh said. From an environmental point of view, nuclear energy is a cleaner option than coal. It is also significantly less land-intensive, he said in a statement.        
	Energy economists have projected that Indias electricity generation will have to grow at 7 per cent a year over the next decade to sustain a real annual GDP growth of 9 per cent.         
	The NPC-Areva joint venture is significant not just from energy generation but also from a strategic point of view, Ramesh said. It is the first practical outcome (relating to import of reactors) of the civilian nuclear agreement India had negotiated successfully with nuclear suppliers between 2005 and 2009.         
	But Ramesh has pointed out that the nuclear complex raises questions about the carrying capacity of the Western Ghats. The total power generating capacity proposed on a narrow strip of coastal land  50 to 90km wide and 200km long  is around 33,000MW.         
	All of the other new plants are coal-based which will add to environmental problems, Ramesh said. The only gas-based plant is at Dabhol.

                        Shah Mahmood Qureshi                                      
	Islamabad, Sep 14 (PTI): Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi today criticised "use of blatant violence" by security forces in Kashmir.
    In a statement issued by the Foreign Office, Qureshi referred to the ongoing situation in Jammu and Kashmir and said the "violence by Indian security forces" had resulted in the "loss of scores of innocent lives since June".
    Qureshi's comments came a day after 17 people, including a policeman, were killed and over 70 injured in violence that erupted when mobs torched government properties and a school in Jammu and Kashmir.
    The Foreign Minister "urged India to exercise restraint and, instead of resorting to violence and procrastination, work towards finding a solution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions and aspirations of Kashmiris".

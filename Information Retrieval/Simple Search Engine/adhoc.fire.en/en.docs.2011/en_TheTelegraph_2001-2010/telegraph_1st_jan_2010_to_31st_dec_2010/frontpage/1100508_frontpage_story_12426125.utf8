  - Tablet of bitter-sweet debate                                            The new woman: Neha Dhupia had thrown a bagful of pills at a promotional for a movie      
	May 7: In the mother of ironies, the birth-control pill turns 50 on Sunday  Mothers Day  so its time to clear up some misconceptions, if youll pardon the expression.        
	The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first pill in the first year of the Swinging Sixties, but the pill did not spark the sexual revolution. Nor did it cause a sudden drop in Americas fertility rate, which didnt bottom out until the early 1970s.        
	Nor has the pill, which slipped into India within a decade, held out much hope for the population control programme: only 3 per cent of Indian women rely on the pill compared with 38 per cent who have opted for sterilisation and 5 per cent who bank on condoms.        
	Yet, the pills influence has been lasting and pervasive. It became a symbol of womens rights and generation change and, for a time, the focus of a debate whether it eroded morals.        
	The pill was groundbreaking in other ways. Women today have a wide range of effective contraceptive choices, virtually all of them variations on the pill. Concerns about adverse effects linked to the early, high-dose oral contraceptives galvanised feminists and gave rise to the consumer health movement.        
	It led, in June 1970, to all manufacturers being ordered to insert information about risks and possible side effects into every package of the pills  a first for any prescription drug.        
	Its not that a technology changes everything, said Andrea Tone, author of a history of contraceptives in America. Its how people reacted to the technology.        
	Other forces  political, cultural, religious and medical  shaped how the pill was perceived and used.        
	The charge in the 1960s was that the pill was promoting promiscuity, Tone said. Yet, a 1953 report on female sexual behaviour had already found that half of all American women had premarital sex.        
	Todays pill users cant remember when it wasnt available. Few were even born when the FDA approved Enovid on May 9, 1960. By 1965, the pill represented the most popular reversible form of birth control in the US.        
	By 1967, the pill merited a Time magazine cover story. By then, the concerns about promiscuity seemed to have quelled although even today they continue to surface, most recently in the debate over access to Plan B, the so-called morning-after pill.        
	Does the convenient contraceptive promote promiscuity? Time asked. In some cases, no doubt it does ---- as did the automobile, the drive-in movie and the motel. But the consensus is that a girl who is promiscuous on the pill would have been promiscuous without it.        
	Although the pill didnt cause the sexual revolution, it was revolutionary, said sex therapist Ruth Westheimer. (It) permitted women to have control, sometimes even against the wishes of their partners. I think that all of us have to be grateful.        
	Sue Kettner, 68, cited other benefits: You have so much better periods. Not using condoms was something my husband appreciated.        
	In India, the pills use appears more popular as a menstrual regulator and even this is restricted to urban, educated women, said Mala Ramanathan, additional professor at a medical institute in Thiruvananthapuram.         
	Some experts believe India needs a stronger social marketing campaign. The pill is among the easiest and safest methods of contraception. Its benefits far outweigh any risks, said Badri Saxena, former head of reproductive sciences at the Indian Council of Medical Research.

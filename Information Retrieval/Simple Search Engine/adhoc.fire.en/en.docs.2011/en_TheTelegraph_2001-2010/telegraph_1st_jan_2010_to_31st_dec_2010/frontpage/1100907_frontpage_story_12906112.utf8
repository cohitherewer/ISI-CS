  More cohesive than Nehru, Indira eras           ASHIS CHAKRABARTI                                                     
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: In a spirited defence of his government, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said it was more cohesive than all previous governments, including those headed by Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.         
	Rebutting charges that the present government was on a drift with ministers openly airing differences, he argued that differences were not necessarily a bad thing. What was necessary was that the government and the cabinet worked in cohesion.        
	There is no disconnect between the government and the cabinet, he said while interacting with newspaper editors at his residence.        
	In fact, he saw the differences as representing the Congress movement.        
	While agreeing that the government had to act cohesively once a decision was taken, he argued that his government had worked with a greater degree of cohesion than Nehrus, when letters were exchanged almost daily between the first Prime Minister and Sardar Patel, his home minister, or Indira Gandhis, when the Young Turks in the Congress openly criticised the government on many issues.        
	He will not shut up every minister who airs some differences but agreed that the government needed to act cohesively. Several questions at the interaction were on the alleged drift in his current government with ministers expressing different views on issues such as the strategy to tackle Naxalism, the situation in Kashmir, education and economic reforms.        
	Congress leaders such as Digvijay Singh and Janardhan Dwivedi had questioned Union home minister P. Chidambarams strategy to tackle the Maoist menace. The Education Tribunal Bill could not be introduced in Parliament because of opposition from within the Congress, especially from senior party leader K. Keshava Rao.        
	Singh defended Chidambaram, saying he was doing an extremely good job. When a questioner drew his attention to Chidambarams complaint that the latter had a limited mandate in dealing with Naxalism, Singh retorted: All of us have limited mandates.        
	He reacted in the same vein when told that the business and industry circles were complaining of the slow and inadequate pace of financial reforms. What reforms are they talking about? Is Wall Street or the City of London the model? Were following a more cautious approach in financial reforms that is suited to our economic needs and genius.        
	The countrys economy had not only survived the global recession unscathed, but was back on the growth path. He hoped that the growth rate would hit nine to 10 per cent in the coming years.        
	He was particularly happy that Parliament had passed the civil nuclear liability bill, which would end the countrys nuclear apartheid and also help achieve the countrys development priorities, especially in the energy sector. Not once did he mention the Left during his one-and-a-half- hour media interaction or its opposition to the nuclear liability bill.         
	In his view, four or five issues and the way the country handles them would define how the Indian polity would shape up in the future. These are the Ayodhya judgment, which is expected to be delivered on September 17, the Kashmir problem, the Naxalite challenge, which he again described as the greatest internal security threat for the country, and triggering enough entrepreneurial activity.        
	But there was no quick-fix solutions because these are no easy problems, which have been there for years and even decades.        
	The Prime Minister also defended his Pakistan policy, saying India had to engage with Pakistan but that does not mean surrender. If we dont want to go to war, dialogue and engagement are the only way.        
	But he could not but be sensitive to Indian public opinion. That was why the composite dialogue process was halted after the Mumbai blast.         
	Pakistan, however, used the breakdown in dialogue to increase its leverage with the international community. After some time, we realised that the collapse of the dialogue process was not delivering the desired results. In Thimphu  at the Saarc Summit  he, therefore, began the process of bringing the dialogue process back on track.         
	He hoped that the Pakistan foreign minister would come to New Delhi in response to the external affairs minister, S.M. Krishnas invitation.         
	On the recent controversy over the environment and forests ministrys veto on the Vedanta groups bauxite mining project in Orissa, Singh sought to tread the middle path between development and environment protection.         
	Environment concerns have come to stay and he urged trade and industry circles to accept it. At the same time, he would not like the environment issues to create a situation where it will be like going back to the licence and permit raj.         
	India has to industrialise and the country cannot reduce poverty by not exploiting the mineral resources, which happen to be located in the tribal heartland of the country.         
	While his personal honesty remained above question, was his governments image being sullied by corruption as over the Commonwealth Games? At least two editors raised the corruption issue and asked whether the country was seeing a steady rise of crony capitalism, especially in sectors like telecom.         
	Singh said he was aware of the danger of crony capitalism and insisted that regulations and regulators must be seen to be effective.

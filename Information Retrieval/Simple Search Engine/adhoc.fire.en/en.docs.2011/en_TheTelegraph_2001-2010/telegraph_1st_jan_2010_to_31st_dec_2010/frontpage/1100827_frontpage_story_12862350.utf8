  - Appeal to review 35-year norms to reflect ground reality          SUJAN DUTTA                            WHICH ZONE?                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: The army has urged the government to change the definition of field areas so that it depicts more accurately the map of internal strife in the country.        
	The definitions of field area  operational postings for its officers and soldiers  and modified field area, coined more than 35 years ago, are now outdated, the army has told the government.        
	Most field areas and modified field areas  postings where personnel can bring their families, subject to some regulations  were on or near the international borders (particularly those with Pakistan and China) back then. Now, deployments for counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism in the hinterland account for nearly a third of the 1.3-million-strong forces total postings.        
	Some of the areas where the army personnel are deployed in significant numbers now are neither geographically very close to the border, nor are they officially classified as field areas.         
	The redefinition has been necessitated not only because of heavy deployments of the army since 1980 in Assam and in Jammu and Kashmir but also because some regions earlier disturbed are now in relative peace, such as parts of Mizoram. The redefinition will also attempt to factor in possible future deployments for aid to civil authorities, such as in tackling Maoist insurgency.        
	The army has asked for a redefinition of the operational areas as part of a package to improve the salaries of soldiers who are given incentives in the form of additional allowances for hardship postings.        
	It has also asked for more lucrative benefits for short service commission officers  such as a Rs 18-lakh grant to each SSC officer after 14 years  to make the service more attractive and make up the shortage in the officer cadre. The army is short of nearly 11,000 officers. Army personnel can be posted in any of these areas field area, modified field area, peace station and headquarters.        
	The definitions for field area and modified field area were coined when counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism had not assumed the kind of urgency they do now, a senior officer at headquarters said.                                       
	We have now proposed to the government that the definition should be based on the operational situation in a particular place (that factors in the threat to life) and the infrastructural deficiencies (that make) the basic necessities of life difficult to come by.                     
	Basically, we want such areas to be determined by the degree of difficulty and threat to life, he explained.        
	Families are not allowed to visit officers and soldiers in field areas (there are exceptions).         
	Since the 1999 Kargil war, high-altitude field area postings have gone up substantially. Almost the entire Line of Control, since then, has to be manned by the army in the toughest terrain  a phenomenon called Siachenisation (from the permanent deployment in the Siachen Glacier that began with Operation Meghdoot in 1984)  and the field area has, therefore, expanded.        
	There is a graded scale of allowances for modified field areas, field areas and high-altitude postings.        
	In 1985 and in 1994 the army made attempts to change the definitions but its proposals were not accepted by the government. Since then, deployments for counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism has scaled-up and the pressure to make the service more attractive has mounted.         
	With improvements in pay and allowances, the army expects to increase the intake of officers. The total number of short service commission officers will be increased from the current 700 a year (from Officers Training Academy, Chennai) to 1,100. An academy in Gaya is scheduled to be opened by the end of the current year.        
	Among other proposals by the army to improve officer intake in short service commission are government funding of up to Rs 3 lakh a year for education and re-employment opportunity in other sectors. If the organisational restructure envisaged by the army is pushed through, only permanent commission officers will be in the chain of command (starting from battalion commander  Colonel rank  upwards).        
	An officer currently becomes a battalion commander at around 38 years of age (after 19-20 years of service). In five years, the army expects, the age-profile of the commanding officer of a battalion would average 35 years or less.

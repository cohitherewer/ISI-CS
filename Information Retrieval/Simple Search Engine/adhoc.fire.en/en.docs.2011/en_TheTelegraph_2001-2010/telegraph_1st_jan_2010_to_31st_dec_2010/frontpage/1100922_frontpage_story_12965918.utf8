The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Munda refuses to be hurried   Slo-mo pace takes toll on governance
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Munda refuses to be hurried 
  Slo-mo pace takes toll on governance          AMIT GUPTA                                                 Chief minister Arjun Munda calls on Governor MOH Farook, who underwent cataract surgery at Kashyap Memorial Eye Hospital in Ranchi on Tuesday. Picture by Hardeep Singh		      
	Arjun Munda is yet to appoint a principal secretary through whom important government files are sent for the chief ministers approval under normal circumstances. The principal secretary is also expected to guide the chief minister on important policy matters         
	Mundas deputies  Sudesh Mahto and Hemant Soren  are not attending office as there is no work to do        
	In the absence of a head (read minister), most government departments are unable to route important files. The secretaries are sitting idle and waiting for their respective bosses to assume office        
	Ranchi, Sept. 21: Ten days since Munda took oath as the eighth chief minister of the state, governance is literally at a standstill.         
	This is sending wrong signals. In his third stint as chief minister, Munda is appearing weak. If he cannot appoint a principal secretary in 10 days, his decision-making quality is in question, said a senior bureaucrat, requesting anonymity.         
	He added that political compulsions notwithstanding, Munda should have expanded his cabinet and distributed portfolios soon after taking oath.         
	Thanks to the non-distribution of portfolios, Mahto and Soren have little to do but enjoy every perk a cabinet minister is entitled to. When contacted, Hemant said he was busy at the party convention in Dumka, while an aide of Mahto stated that his boss was away playing football in Silli.                  
	Sources based at the chief ministers secretariat revealed that a few files of emergent nature have come for the chief ministers nod through Alka Tiwary, who is in-charge of the secretariat.         
	The files pertained to issues like granting extension to the director of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences among others.         
	However, an important proposal relating to renewal of a PSUs iron-ore mining lease is stuck for want of a cabinet nod, while the claim for financial grant from the Centre to mitigate drought, needs to be followed up.         
	The Centre has so far not allocated any fund despite a central team assessing the situation over a month ago. Besides, there is no development as far as release of Rs 80 crore to Jharkhand State Electricity Board to carry out development plans and purchase transformers is concerned.         
	Moreover, there are at least 15 proposals sent by different departments awaiting clearance from the state cabinet. The last cabinet meeting took place on September 13.         
	In that meeting, some important decisions like approval of Sixth Pay Commission package for university teachers and sacking of engineers appointed in an illegitimate manner in unified Bihar were taken, but the ground work for the same was finalised during Presidents rule. In fact, the governors advisory council was to pass all the decisions in the first week of September, when Munda staked claim to form the next government in the state.         
	Meanwhile, in a bid to send the message that he was not going to allocate the home portfolio to any of his deputies, Munda chaired a meeting at the police headquarters yesterday. He also stated that improvement of roads would be his governments priority.         
	However, cabinet expansion or distribution of portfolios can only take place on or after September 24, when the MLAs and would-be ministers from main ally in the Munda government, JMM, return from Dumka.         
	Another important issue that Munda needs to settle is rehabilitation of his bete noire Raghubar Das, the former deputy chief minister, who is said to be nursing a bruised ego in Jamshedpur. Das apparently had his eyes on the chief ministers chair and has threatened to quit the post of party president on September 25. He could be offered a berth in the Munda cabinet.         
	Amid all the chaos, crucial decisions aimed at providing better governance in the ill-fated state continue to be the victims. There is no word so far on early conduct of panchayat polls in the state, the states strong approach for additional funds from the Centre to mitigate the effect of drought and expediting industrial proposals.        
	After assuming charge and sailing through the trust vote in a makeshift Assembly, Munda has spent most of his time visiting Nagpur and Delhi, among other places, in his bid to gather the blessings of senior BJP leaders and RSS functionaries.        
	Reacting to the way governance seems to have come a halt, JVM(P) legislative party leader Pradeep Yadav said his party had always been raising the issue of unholy alliance between BJP and JMM that would bear no result.

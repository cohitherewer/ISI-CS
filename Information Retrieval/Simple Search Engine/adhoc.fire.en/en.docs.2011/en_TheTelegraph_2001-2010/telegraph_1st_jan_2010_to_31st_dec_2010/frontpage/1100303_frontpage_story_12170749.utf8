  - Study denies Indian men western excuse          G.S. MUDUR                                                    
	New Delhi, March 2: For Indian men, the heart can no longer be an excuse for drinking.        
	A medical study has shown that even light or moderate drinking does not protect Indian men from coronary heart disease, contradicting widespread perceptions that doctors say were based largely on western research.        
	Alcohol consumption by Indian men not only does not protect them from coronary heart disease, it might actually be contributing to possible harm, according to the study by a team of doctors from eight institutions across India.        
	The study, the largest so far from India to investigate the link between alcohol and the heart, suggests that the prevalence of heart disease is about 38 per cent higher among alcohol users than among men who dont drink alcohol.        
	Its time to revise an idea that has captured public imagination, said Ambuj Roy, a cardiologist at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, who is the lead author of the study just published in the international journal Atherosclerosis.        
	Moderate alcohol consumption has long been believed to protect against heart disease, although doctors have always cautioned that high alcohol consumption carries significant health risks.        
	The protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption appears strongest among southern European populations from the Mediterranean region, Roy said, but also visible in other Caucasian populations in Europe and North America. But it appears that this protective effect has been overrated, K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, told The Telegraph.        
	The Indian study which covered 4,400 drinkers and an almost equal number of non-drinkers from 10 cities has shown that the excess risk of heart disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed daily  or averaged to a daily quantity.        
	Heavy drinkers  men who consumed more than 60ml alcohol a day  had twice the excess risk of heart disease than men who did not drink at all. Moderate drinkers had 60 per cent excess risk.        
	The researchers believe several factors could explain the absence of protection.        
	There may be differences in how people from different populations metabolise alcohol, said Dorairaj Prabhakaran, a cardiologist at the Centre for Chronic Disease and Control, New Delhi. Three years ago, a US study indicated that alcohol use had no beneficial effect on African-Americans  whether men or women.        
	But, Prabhakaran said, the absence of the protective effect may also be linked to patterns of alcohol drinking which are significantly different in India than in the West. Alcohol is often consumed with meals and in moderate amounts in the West.        
	In India, the trend is binge drinking (large amounts consumed at one go), and its usually not with meals, but before meals, said Reddy. This might be contributing to the harmful effects weve observed, he said.        
	The first hint that Indians may not be protected by alcohol consumption surfaced three years ago in an international study that looked for risk factors by comparing patients with heart disease and those without heart disease.        
	The study, led by Salim Yusuf in Canada, had found that while alcohol protected people from heart attacks in the large sample population from 52 countries, it appeared to be harmful to Indians.        
	We began wondering why the protective effect is missing in India, said Roy. It was the first indication that on alcohol consumption and heart disease, we cannot extrapolate from Western data, he said.        
	Although the Indian researchers tried to include women in their study, the number of women who drink regularly was not enough for statistically significant findings.

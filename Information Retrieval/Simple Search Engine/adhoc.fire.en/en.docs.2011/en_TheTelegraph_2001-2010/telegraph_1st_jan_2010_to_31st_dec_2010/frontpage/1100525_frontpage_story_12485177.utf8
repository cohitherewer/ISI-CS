   Retirement ruled out, PM leaves door ajar
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                                     
	New Delhi, May 24: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today strode adroitly across the trickiest terrain in the Congress, smothering murmurs of an impending succession, dynastic or otherwise, in UPA II, yet leaving the door avuncularly ajar for heir apparent Rahul Gandhi.        
	I have been given a job and it is incomplete, he said, responding to a question at his second media conference as Prime Minister at Vigyan Bhawan. Until that happens, there is no question of my retiring.        
	Replying to an earlier poser on whether he was ready to step aside for Rahul, Singh had said: I sometimes feel younger people should take over. As and when the Congress party makes that judgement, I will be happy to make way for anybody the party may choose.         
	In the immediate, though, the Prime Minister appeared to hint, he would be happier to have Rahul serve in his cabinet. Rahul is well qualified to hold a cabinet post. I have discussed with him on a number of occasions but he has always been reluctant to give a positive answer telling me that he has duties to perform in reviving the Congress party and he is doing a very good job. I have every reason to believe that as and when he is ready to join the cabinet, he would be a very, very appropriate addition to the cabinet.        
	There has been undying speculation of a change of guard with Singh handing the baton to Rahul  or even a party dark horse  ahead of the expiry of his second tenure. But Singh blew that away with measured ripostes delivered in a tone untainted by personal ambition or political defiance. There was a task to be done, and he was there to do it.        
	To those who called his attention to retirement, he called attention to his undiminished appetite for work. It is not proper to mark myself on performance, I leave the judging to the people and the media. But I am reasonably happy about the way and the pace at which I have been working.         
	Perhaps a measure of his assuredness in office  and compact with party boss Sonia Gandhi  was also the way he responded to a question on differences between them. There is not an iota of truth in talk of mistrust or distrust. She is the president of the party and leader of the UPA. I have the benefit of constant advice and guidance from her. We meet every week, so there is no gap between me and her, and no requirement for a mechanism to co-ordinate between the government and the party.         
	Singh, 78, underwent a quintuple bypass surgery in January 2009, won another five-year term months later and is barely two months short of becoming the longest-serving Prime Minister after Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.         
	Throughout the hour and odd minutes that he faced the media, solitary behind a bank of flowers on the panoramic stage, Singh was a measured act, too measured for any allowance to flair and flamboyance, which arent the mans mien.        
	From his contentious bid for peace with Pakistan to Naxalism to the dissonance on key issues within his own party and government to cries for telecommunications minister A. Rajas head for alleged sleaze in the 2G auction, the Prime Minister flat-batted most volleys, often not with conviction but always with composure.        
	He mostly parried a question on possible action against Raja, saying that since an inquiry was on, it would not be proper for him to comment in depth.        
	The matter has been discussed in Parliament and Mr Raja has said publicly that what he did was to implement the policy in place. It is certainly true that if you compare figures of what was collected by 2G process as against 3G process, there is a huge gap. But, I think, one has to look at this whole problem in proper perspective.         
	There was a particular policy which was in place since 2003, before our government came into power, and Mr Rajas point was that it would amount to discrimination against various new entrants if a different yardstick was appointed. But if I come to know there is corruption at any level, I will take action.         
	The Prime Minister appeared less perturbed about ministers and party leaders speaking publicly in fractured voices, although he said it wasnt a good idea. I welcome dialogue between ministers. It is an advantage that ministers give their opinions freely though of course it should be taken up in the cabinet.         
	He seemed to issue a public, though subtle, rebuff to home minister P. Chidambaram by defending the right of human rights and civil society activists to air their opposition to the governments handling of Maoist violence.        
	The Prime Minister categorically said: India is a democratic country and everyone has a right to air their views. Until and unless these voices are advocating violence, there can be no gag on them.        
	The home ministry had last fortnight issued a veiled warning to activists and intellectuals against speaking for Maoists.        
	On the Maoist challenge itself, Singh argued that their disruptions were beginning to retard national growth.In what could be a deliberate ploy to keep expectations tempered, the Prime Ministers opening statement made no mention of his pet pursuit in UPA II  peace with Pakistan. But answering questions, he remained resolute that dialogue with Pakistan was the best and, probably, only option.        
	Singh held out no promises but emphasised that he considered it his duty to try. We have an obligation to make every effort, he said. Whether we will succeed or not, only the future will tell.

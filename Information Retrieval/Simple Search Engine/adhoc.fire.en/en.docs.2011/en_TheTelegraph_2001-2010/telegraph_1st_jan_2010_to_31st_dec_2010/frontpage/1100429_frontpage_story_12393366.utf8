                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Risk-bond key opens Stephen Court doors
          A STAFF REPORTER                                              
	Fire-ravaged Stephen Court is set to welcome back its first 16 families by Friday with the authorities granting conditional access to them and a few of the citys favourite food-and-fun stops that have remained shut for over a month.         
	The decision to allow some residents of blocks III and IV  unaffected by the fire  to move back in was announced at Stephen Court by a team comprising police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, fire services director Gopal Bhattacharyya and senior officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on Wednesday.         
	Chakrabarti told the residents that they would have to sign risk bonds mentioning the safety steps that they needed to take immediately, including building a separate emergency staircase for each block and installing sprinklers.        
	 In the first phase, we have selected 16 out of 31 flat owners of blocks III and IV based on various safety parameters. They can move in with their families by Friday subject to meeting our conditions. Six establishments  Flurys, Peter Cat, Silver Grill, One Step Up, Music World and Jet Airways  can also conditionally resume functioning within a couple of days, said a senior officer in Lalbazar.        
	The residents who have been allowed to move in need to get the risk bonds notified in a court of law, then submit a copy each to the police and another to CESC along with three months paid electricity bills.        
	Those with homes in blocks I and II of the Park Street landmark, which bore the brunt of the blaze, wont be allowed to return for now.        
	A joint police, CESC and CMC team had surveyed each flat in blocks III and IV last month and asked the residents to take immediate measures like getting the electric wiring in their flats overhauled by contractors appointed by the authorities.        
	Ratna Lilaram, a resident of the first floor of Block IV, was one of the happy faces in front of Shakespeare police station on Wednesday. I have come to collect my copy of the risk bond. Finally, things are moving in the right direction. I cant wait to move back into our flat with my family, she told Metro.        
	W.D. Silva, co-owner of the Silver Grill restaurant, was just as excited.        
	 I have collected the risk bond. The fire department officials called us on Thursday to give some instructions on fire safety. We are really looking forward to reopening our restaurant, he said.

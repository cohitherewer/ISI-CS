                                Ariyawathi in a hospital in Matara, Lanka. (Reuters)                            
	Colombo, Aug. 27 (AP): Doctors removed 13 nails and five needles from a Sri Lankan maid who says the couple she worked for in Saudi Arabia hammered them into her body.        
	L.G. Ariyawathi, who was hospitalised with severe pain after returning on Saturday from Saudi Arabia, has said the family she worked for punished her by heating the nails and needles before sticking them into her. X-rays showed that she had 24 nails and needles in her body, said Dr Keerthi Satharasinghe of Kamburupitiya hospital, about 160km from Colombo.        
	The nails ranged in length from 2.5 to 5cm while the needles were about 2.5cm long. They were removed from her legs and forehead.        
	The surgery is successful and she is recovering now, Satharasinghe said after the three-hour procedure.        
	He said six more needles in her hands could not be removed because the operation might damage her nerves and arteries, but that they would not be harmful to her.        
	Since being hospitalised, Ariyawathi, 49, has described the abuse meted out by her employers.        
	They did not allow me even to rest. The woman at the house had heated the nails and then the man inserted them into my body, Ariyawathi was quoted as saying by the Lakbima newspaper. She told the newspaper that she went to Saudi Arabia in March but was paid only two months salary, with her employer withholding the rest to buy an air ticket to send her home.

	Jamshedpur, June 30: Initial findings of the district administration suggest that the high-handedness of security guards deployed at Tata Steels Sakchi gate provoked a mob of contract labourers to resort to arson and unprecedented violence inside the factory premises on Monday.        
	Though the probe is yet to be completed, our initial findings suggest that a minor dispute over the entry of a contract worker into the premises flared up due to the indecent behaviour of the securitymen on duty, said Kartik Kumar Prabhat, the sub-divisional officer of Dhalbhum entrusted with the magisterial inquiry ordered by East Singhbhum deputy commissioner R.K. Agarwal.        
	Prabhat said they had found out that the securitymen used to charge Rs 10 from contract workers who did not have the regulation a safety card. All contract workers are required to show it before entering the premises. But there are some who dont. And the securitymen used to allow them in for a charge of Rs 10, he said.         
	The administration has also learnt that contract labourers had been having altercations at the gate regularly ever since a new batch of about 350 security personnel, all wards of Tata Steel employees, was posted there.         
	Mondays dispute between a contract labourer and the securitymen became the trigger for others to give vent to their pent-up rage against the high-handedness of the security personnel.        
	The contract workers are also to be blamed as they cannot take the law in their own hands, Prabhat said, Efforts are on to identify those who played a key role in the violence.        
	The SDO revealed the probe report was likely to be ready in the next couple of days. I will submit the report to the deputy commissioner by the end of the week, he said.

	New Delhi, Nov 16 (PTI): The four-storey building collapse in East Delhi has claimed 66 lives and left 130 injured in one of the worst such disasters in the capital, as massive rescue operations were today on to pull out those trapped under the debris.  
	"66 people have died and about 130 are injured and admitted to various hospitals of the capital with a major chunk being at the LNJP," Delhi Health Minister Kiran Walia said.  
	41 bodies have been taken to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP), 16 to Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital, six to Hedgewar Hospital and three to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital.  
	 Over 60 families, mostly labourers from West Bengal, were living in the cramped quarters of the 15-year-old building, where an illegal fifth floor was under construction.   
	The entire structure crashed down around 8.15 PM yesterday at Lalita Park in Laxmi Nagar.

				                       Rouvanjit Rawla, a student of La Martiniere for Boys, committed suicide                                
	Kolkata, June 16 (PTI): Kolkata Police today said it is yet to question the principal of La Martiniere for Boys School, a day after he expressed regret for caning a 13-year-old student who allegedly committed suicide.  
	Deputy Commissioner of Kolkata Police, Damayanti Sen, said the police had talked to the family of the student Rouvanjit Rawla, but not yet questioned the principal Sunirmal Chakravarthy, who admitted that caning the student was a mistake and was ready to face the consequences for that.   
	An investigation is on and the complainant has to be examined,....we are proceeding with the inputs, she told PTI.  The principal had yesterday said, It was a mistake. I have apologised to the school board and for this I am ready to face the consequences.   
	Chakrabarthy, however, insisted caning should not be linked to the student's death. I think it is stretching it a bit too far.  Rouvanjit Rawla committed suicide on February 12 four days after he was subjected to caning in the school along with two other boys for playing truant, he said.							   
	Chakravarthy said Rouvanjit had been hauled up for bursting stink bombs in the classroom. He was issued a note and had been asked to bring his father to school on the following Monday.

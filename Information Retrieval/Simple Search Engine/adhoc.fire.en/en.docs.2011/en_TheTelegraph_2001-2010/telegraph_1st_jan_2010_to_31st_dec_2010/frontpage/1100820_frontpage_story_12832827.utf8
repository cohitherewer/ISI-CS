The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 17000 trains not a joke: Mamata 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                17000 trains not a joke: Mamata 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Mamata                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 19: Mamata Banerjee today told the Lok Sabha she could not be blamed for all the recent train accidents since some of them were acts of sabotage.        
	She told her political rivals not to kill people to defame her.        
	The railway minister also claimed that the number of accidents had actually come down even though the casualties had gone up. Third, she sought shelter in the argument that the railways huge responsibilities meant that human error was likely to happen now and then.        
	It is not a joke to run 17,000 trains a day, she said, replying to a debate on the supplementary grants for her ministry.        
	The railway minister, appearing in Parliament for the first time after her Lalgarh rally on August 9, came under fire from MPs for the rise in train accidents and her long absences from Delhi.         
	When CPM member Ramchandra Dome blamed her for the two recent railway disasters in Bengal, Trinamul Congress MPs were on their feet and the House witnessed raucous scenes.        
	Mamata said: The railways travel far and wide. If somebody silently removes a clip or plants a bomb, what can we do? We cannot have security at every place.        
	Without naming the CPM, her obvious target, she said: You can attack me politically, but politically I cannot kill and you also cannot kill.         
	She blamed the Jnaneshwari tragedy on sabotage but desisted from putting the Sainthia train crash in the same category.         
	Criticised for staying away from Delhi, Mamata challenged her critics to prove her absences had affected the railways functioning or that a single file was pending. Ask me any question about the railway ministry and I will answer you now without even consulting a single paper, Mamata said.         
	In what may have been a slip of the tongue, she ended up implying that democracy was a disadvantage as she explained why India could not match China in railway infrastructure.        
	China mein democracy nahi hai. Ye unka advantage hai. Woh log kuchh bhi kar sakta hai. Lekin humko slowly karne hoga. Hum goli markey land acquire nahi karenge (China doesnt have democracy. This is its advantage. They can do anything, but we have to work slowly. We will not use bullets to acquire land), she said, taking an oblique swipe at the CPMs land acquisition policies. The Left MPs listened quietly.         
	Mamata avoided saying anything about the recent Opposition criticism of her Lalgarh speech. The Rajya Sabha was in uproar when the CPMs Sitaram Yechury raised the issue during zero hour and harped on Mamatas alleged Maoist ties.

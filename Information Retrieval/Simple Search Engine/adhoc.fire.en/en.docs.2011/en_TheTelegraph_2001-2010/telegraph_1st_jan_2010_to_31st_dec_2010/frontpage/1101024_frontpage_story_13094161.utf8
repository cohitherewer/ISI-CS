	Cambridge, Oct. 23: Prakash Karat set a high standard of debate and public speaking for Mamata Banerjee to follow when he spoke on whether the Left was still relevant in India at a gathering of leading historians in Cambridge yesterday.        
	Apart from a little bit of a rant at America, Karat spoke so well and seemed so much at home that The Telegraph felt compelled to ask him: Dont you think you should give up politics and take up academic life you may find its more fun?        
	 The CPM general secretary grinned, possibly not displeased with the question.        
	A bit late in the day, dont you think? he responded.        
	For the Trinamul Congress leader, who also has an open invitation to come to Cambridge, it wont be an easy act to follow.        
	I am probably the only non-scholar on the panel of speakers today so I hope you will make allowance for that, said Karat with charming modesty, as he addressed a seminar organised by the Centre for South Asian Studies at Cambridge.        
	The subject was: Lessons of Empire  a Past and Present conference in honour of V.G. Kiernan.        
	Among world famous historians present at what turned out be a packed meeting were Eric Hobsbawn and Christopher Bayly.                  Heather Keirnan.   Telegraph picture      
	They had all come to speak in praise of Victor Gordon Kiernan, a Marxist historian, who died last year, aged 95, and who had taught at Edinburgh University when Karat came under his influence.        
	The meeting took place at the University Centre in Mill Lane at a time when Cambridge is in full flow during Michaelmas Term. From the window of the centre, Karat would have seen those students who had time punting on the River Cam  an idyllic scene a long way from the political battles of Calcutta.        
	Karat explained to The Telegraph in a private conversation: I studied in Edinburgh for two years  1968-70. He (Keirnan) was there teaching history, I took a course with him in history. Apart from the fact he was teaching history he was one of the few people who knew something about India so I became a friend of his also we had a discussions.        
	There were several copies of a book on Kiernan edited by Karat for sale for a bargain price of 10. Across Time and Continents: A Tribute to Victor G Kiernan, with articles and essays about the great man by other equally great men, was published by Karat in 2003 to mark Kiernans 90th birthday when the Marxist historian was still alive.        
	It is priced in India at Rs 450 so there was a capitalistic mark up of Rs 200 yesterday  a healthy profit of 44 per cent.        
	Karat, who affected quite a donnish look in a dark maroon sweater, followed Jayati Ghosh, an economist from JNU in Delhi who spoke on the unsteady empire of finance.        
	Karat was introduced by Dr John Trumpbour, research director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, who said: I like to think of Prakash Karat as running the south Asia branch of the Victor Kiernan appreciation society  and he is here to talk about Victor Kiernan and the Left in India.        
	Karat began with an anecdote: Victor Kiernan lived in India from 1938 to 1946 and he knew a lot about India. When I first met him in the University of Edinburgh, when I introduced myself he asked me where I am from. I said I am from Kerala. Then he asked which caste are you from which I dont normally use. I said I am a Menon. He said, Oh, you are going to join the civil service. I told him in Kerala Menons are civil servants and Menons are also communists. I belong to the latter category.        
	Later, Karat held up Kerala --- not Bengal --- as a virtual paradise where the communists had created the most successful welfare state in India with the best rates of literacy, health and food distribution.        
	Yesterday, Karat revealed another aspect of his character --- a man of letters and especially poetry. Mamata will have to come up with the goods on Tagore.        
	The context was that Keirnan was more than just a dry Marxist. As his widow, Heather, showed in a series of photographs yesterday --- she had met him when she was his student --- her late husband had been a man with a wide range of interests from Sherlock Holmes to science fiction, Milton and Shakespeare.        
	He had also been very keen on Urdu poetry --- something Karat emphasised.        
	Victor Kiernan stayed in India just before the time the Second World War broke and Eric Hobsbawn in his tribute in Past and Present (a journal) said India unexpectedly drew him away for several years on the major themes on which his reputation will probably rest. But his long stay in India was fortunate for us in the Indian subcontinent, a period which was very productive. Without his being there, there would not have been the first translations of both Iqbal and Faiz Ahmed Faiz into English. Nor would we have got his essays on Marx on India and his perceptive writings on the relationship between British imperialism and its foremost colony.        
	Kiernan had befriend Faiz in Lahore.        
	Karat continued: About Faiz we are going to observe the birth centenary of Faiz Ahmed Faiz next year. He is one of the greatest poets produced in India --- I mean (undivided) India and Pakistan in the 20th century. And we are looking forward to celebrating the centenary in both India and Pakistan. And this should be the occasion for us to get Victor Kiernans translation of Faiz Ahmed Faizs poems again because they are hardly available now. The only publisher was there in Pakistan.        
	Keirnan, said Karat, also he has a number of articles, introductions and speeches about Faiz Ahmed Faiz where things should be collected and put together during this centenary year.        
	On the continuing relevance of the Left in India, Karat made a number of thoughtful points but perhaps he could have explained more fully why he felt Indias new closeness to the United States was harming domestic politics.        
	I think capitalism in India has proved surprisingly resilient and is rapidly proliferating, he conceded. And the bane of a section of the Indian Left has been to underestimate this class and write it off as of no consequence. The varieties of the ultra Left in India, including the current crop of Maoists, are symptomatic of this trend. This underlines the necessity for Marxists and historians to study the Indian bourgeoisie in greater depth. There is no study available today of the Indian capitalist class which has comprehensively covered the whole gamut of the growth of the Indian bourgeoisie.        
	It wasnt clear whether he was pitching for a six-month sabbatical in Cambridge.        
	The Indian capitalist class has grown enormously under the neo liberal dispensation, he went on. Its potential, which has always been underrated, is now being seen in full flow. But as Victor Kiernan pointed out this is a capitalism which has been profoundly affected by local backdrop. This brings us to the necessity to understand both in theory and in practice how class structures in India are influenced by and integrate with structures of hierarchy, discrimination and oppression that are particular to Indian society, reflected, for instance, in vast tribe and gender oppression, and in the exclusion of whole geographic regions from freedom and development.        
	He argued that Marxists have come to realise the unique role of caste in socio-economic formation --- how it prevented change and social transformation at key times in Indian history. The bulk of the support for the Communist movement even today comes from the areas where movements took place mainly in the 1941 to 1948 period when the Communists succeeded in bringing together and leading the two main historical currents of peoples struggles: the struggle against the colonial power and the struggle of the rural masses for freedom from exploitation. Thus where the communists brought in the anti imperialist and anti landlord movements together and gave leadership to this united struggle they gained mass support.        
	Karat carried on: The communist parties in India still have a popular mass support.        
	He underlined the importance of the Left: The communist movement in India is one of the few places where the party has a mass base and millions of adherents. It still gets millions of votes and the Left in India is now running three state governments which covers about 120m people. So we feel acutely the need for theorising and understanding many of the new developments in India.        
	As for the future, the Left in India today is still banking of some of the perspectives and the programmes which were set out in the period of the 1940s. The basic platform is still the struggle for land reforms which can lead to the elimination of rural poverty and doing so requires not just the fight against landlordism but the caste, social and gender oppression embedded into the system. Neo liberal capitalism poses a big challenge for us.        
	He gave examples of the challenges for the Left. India is today producing people with enormous wealth  the latest Forbes study says we had 69 dollar billionaires in 2010 and that is 17 more in one year. From 52 to 69. That is the growth of billionaires in India.        
	There was a ripple of laughter.        
	The inequalities which have developed and the nature of exploitation --- there are forms of exploitation which are similar to primitive accumulation of capital going on in India today. And the Left is the only force which is putting forward some alternative set of policies but as I said we need to study in some more depth how capitalism is growing in India. Although it was superimposed during colonialism it is turning out to be one of the most resilient and most vibrant and most exploitative, of course, of capitalisms in the world today.        
	Then he turned his attention to the US. This is all happening when there is a strategic link with imperialism that has developed. We have a country now next to China in terms of population, in terms of the resources and growth of its economy, which is now openly linked and strategically allied with the United States of America. This has its consequences --- we are facing it in our domestic policies (we have to) come out with a strategy whereby India can play an independent role in the world and not be linked up to the United States of America. These are some of the challenges which the Left is now confronted with.

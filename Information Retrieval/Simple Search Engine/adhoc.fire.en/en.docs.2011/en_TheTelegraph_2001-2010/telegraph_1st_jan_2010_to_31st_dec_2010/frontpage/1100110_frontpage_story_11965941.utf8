          OUR BUREAU                                     
	Calcutta, Jan. 9: Jyoti Basus condition deteriorated since this morning and signs of multi-organ failure emerged during the day.         
	Apart from the infection in his lungs, which has caused pneumonia, the 95-year-old former chief ministers central nervous system, cardiovascular system, kidneys and liver developed problems, precipitating a fresh crisis for the eight-member medical board treating Basu.        
	Till yesterday, we were treating him for the bacterial infections and fluctuating blood pressure and pulse rate. Now there is a fresh challenge as a number of vital organs are not functioning properly, a doctor said.         
	The bronchial infection seems to have spread to other organs, affecting their functioning, said the doctor, adding that Basu was suffering from septicaemia.         
	Septicaemia is a bacterial infection of the blood. In Basus case, it is the result of the cascading effect of the lung infections.        
	Basu has been on ventilator support since January 6 because of lung failure. The doctors identified bacterial infection as the reason for the lung failure.         
	We have been administering antibiotics to tackle the infections. But given the low immunity of his system and the virulent nature of the bacterial infections, the infections have now spread to the blood stream, explained a doctor.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, accompanied by his wife Meera and CPM state secretary Biman Bose, visited the hospital this evening and spoke to the doctors on Basus condition.         
	We are worried about his condition. Lets all hope that he recovers fast, said Bhattacharjee while addressing a party meeting in Barasat from where he went to the hospital.         
	According to hospital sources, because of the infection in lungs caused by three varieties of Gram-negative bacilli  acinetobacter, pseudomonas and klebsiella  Basus blood pressure and pulse rate were fluctuating throughout the day and the amount of inotropic drugs (for stabilising blood pressure) was increased.        
	Hospital sources said Basus condition deteriorated abruptly around 2am. His level of consciousness went down  a condition known as depressed sensorium in medical parlance  and he started suffering bouts of drowsiness.         
	Further complications set in later as the condition of his kidneys deteriorated, which stopped urinary output, and his liver showed signs of malfunctioning.         
	Kidney malfunctioning resulted in fluid deposition in parts of the body, including his brain, a situation known as cerebral oedema. This is cause for major concern, a doctor said.        
	The doctors administered drugs to increase Basus urinary output and the evening medical bulletin said the drugs partially served their purpose.         
	His urine output improved slightly but with the help of loop diuretic drugs. In case there is a need, we will have to go for haemodialysis. But thats not a favourable option, considering his age, a medical board member said.  
	Worrying factors   
	Central nervous system: Brain function affected,   causing bouts of drowsiness. Cerebral oedema has  developed  
	 Kidneys: Not functioning well. Urine output has   practically stopped; also, there is urine retention  
	 Cardiovascular: Poor   functioning has led to   irregular heartbeats  
	 Blood pressure and   pulse rate: Fluctuating. Pressure-stabilising drugs   increased significantly  
	 Lungs: Failure has forced doctors to put him on   ventilator support  
	 Infection: Severe bacterial infections that have become resistant to antibiotics  
	 Liver: Not functioning   properly

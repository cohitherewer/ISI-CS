          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 3: The Arjun Munda government launched a massive effort today to train over one lakh jobless youths in various skills by tapping resources from a national programme, signalling the states seriousness about fighting poverty and unemployment.        
	Presiding over a high-level meeting, Munda okayed the launch of a skill development mission with special focus on dropouts to effectively utilise the benefits of schemes pursued by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) that aims to impart various skills to over 500 million people by 2022.        
	Today, as many as 21 trades were identified for imparting training. These included carpentry, masonry, plumbing, tailoring, et al.         
	Human resource development secretary Mridula Sinha was named nodal officer and asked to identify other trades where skill development programmes would prove beneficial for the poor.        
	We will be giving special preference to school dropouts, housewives and poor people living in rural areas, said the chief minister.         
	Jharkhand is a developing state. But the state will benefit only if the people living here are able to avail of new job opportunities that will come in abundance in the coming days.        
	Munda spoke of introducing training programmes in housekeeping and child care so that women could graduate from working as maid servants and labourers at brick kilns.        
	The programmes, he added, would be run on public-private partnership with the state taking the help of industrial houses and financial institutions. Ultimately, a state vocational training board will be set up for monitoring the training programmes.        
	Initially, we will be appointing a mission director. Once we complete our homework, we will be talking to senior functionaries of NSDC. For survival in the changed scenario, we have to explore new opportunities of learning through earning and constantly upgrading existing skills, Munda said.        
	Todays meeting also decided to introduce training courses for nurses and midwives at government hospitals with 200 or more beds. The next meeting has been scheduled for December 15.

          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 26: If one project named after Jyoti Basu has underscored the divisions between the government and the Opposition, another has managed to bring closer Somnath Chatterjee and the Trinamul Congress.        
	Trinamul leaders will join hands with the expelled CPM leader when he throws open a clinic-cum-pathology unit for tribals living in Santiniketan villages under the banner of the Jyoti Basu Seva Kendra.        
	Mamata Banerjee herself is not scheduled to attend  the former Lok Sabha Speaker termed the initiative too small an effort to merit the railway ministers presence  but her party leaders in Birbhum are expected to turn up at the October 2 programme in Santiniketan.        
	The Trinamul gesture has come at a time Mamata is yet to formally respond to housing minister Gautam Debs invitation to an event to rename New Town after the late Jyoti Basu on October 7.        
	Chatterjee has recently floated the NGO, named after the late CPM patriarch. The NGO, funded by a trust, has converted an abandoned primary school into a clinic that will be formally inaugurated on October 2 by Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim.        
	I am grateful to Trinamul Congress and Congress leaders in Birbhum for agreeing to make themselves available during the inauguration. Two state ministers  Kanti Ganguly and Srikumar Mukherjee  will be among us, besides Halim saheb, Chatterjee told The Telegraph.        
	The clinic-cum-pathology unit will serve over 700 families living in Pearsonpally and the adjoining Baganpara village, Chatterjee added.        
	Asked to comment on the CPMs repeated allegation about Trinamuls non-cooperation over development projects in the state, Chatterjee said: I dont know what the CPM is saying because I am no more in the party. But I have no complaints against Trinamul since its leaders are always cooperating with me.         
	We shall attend the programme at Somnathbabus request, regardless of whether any state minister would be present there or not, said Chandranath Sinha, the chairman of Trinamul-run Bolpur municipality.        
	Asked if he would invite Mamata to the programme, Chatterjee said: Mine is a small effort because I have started with whatever funds I could arrange from the trust, named after my parents. So, this programme does not merit the railway ministers presence.        
	Chatterjee occupies an unforgettable place in Mamatas political career: she had debuted in electoral politics by defeating him in the Jadavpur parliamentary seat in 1984.

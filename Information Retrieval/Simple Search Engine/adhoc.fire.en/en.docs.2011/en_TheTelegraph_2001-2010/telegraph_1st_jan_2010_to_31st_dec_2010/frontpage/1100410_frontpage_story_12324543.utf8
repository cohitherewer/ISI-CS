          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Chidambaram after paying homage to martyrs of the Battle of Sardar Post on the Gujarat border during a Valour Day programme organised by the CRPF in Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, April 9: Home minister Palaniappan Chidambaram had resigned on Wednesday evening hours after paying homage to the 76 security personnel killed by Maoists in Dantewada but the Prime Minister rejected his offer.         
	The home minister gave it (his resignation) in writing the day before yesterday. The Prime Minister rejected it, a spokesman for the Prime Ministers Office said today.        
	The PMO statement followed broad hints dropped during the day by the home minister who said: Immediately on my return from Chhattisgarh, I called on the Prime Minister and gave it in writing that I accept full responsibility for what happened.        
	If this was not indication enough, Chidambaram added: I think I will stop there. Let me not elaborate.        
	The elaboration was left to the PMO.         
	On the sidelines of the CRPF Valour Day ceremony, Chidambaram said: I have been asked directly or indirectly where the buck stops for what happened in Dantewada. I have no hesitation saying the buck stops at my desk.        
	Just before the Dantewada killings, the most vicious attack on the security forces ever, Chidambaram had said on a visit to Bengal, also racked by Maoist violence, that the buck stops with the chief minister.        
	It was a phrase that may have returned to haunt him after the massacre. I accept full responsibility for what happened in Dantewada, he said.        
	At Wednesdays news conference in Jagdalpur, near the site of the carnage, the minister could be seen fighting back tears at a ceremony to pay homage to the slain troopers.         
	He returned from Jagdalpur extremely upset and made up his mind to resign soon after, said an aide.         
	The home minister received support not just from his own party but also from the Opposition BJP. The BJP does not want Chidambaram to resign at this stage. His resignation would mean a victory for the Naxalites. He cant whimper like an injured soldier on a back foot, spokesman Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.        
	He has become a victim of his the buck stops here statement. The buck stops where is not important for us at this stage.        
	The Congress said: The statement by Chidambaram to the Prime Minister owning full moral responsibility does not need to be commented upon. It is appreciated and commended.        
	It advocated a two-pronged approach: the Centre assisting states in carrying out anti-Naxal operations and regaining territory from their influence and addressing the socio-economic issues.         
	The Congresss core group met later in the day to discuss the Dantewada attack and Chidambarams offer to resign, sources said. The Prime Minister, Sonia Gandhi, Pranab Mukherjee, A.K. Antony and Ahmed Patel, the political secretary to the Congress president, attended the meeting.         
	In his speech at the CRPF ceremony, Chidambaram denied reports that the slain CRPF men were not well equipped or trained. He said: Much has been written in the last few days. Some of it has pleased me, some of it has pained me. For example, it has been written that the companies of the 62nd battalion (whose men laid down their lives) were poorly trained, poorly equipped and they did not arrive with preparedness.        
	It is also written that the police forces that are deployed in these areas kill indiscriminately, rape women. Anyone who puts pen to paper to write these words certainly has no heart and no conscience. Very little is written about the valour, very little is written about the bravery.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Maimed Bundu vows to take on Maoists
  - Angry villagers block NH-33 for six hours          RAJ KUMAR                            A choked NH-33 on Friday. (Prashant Mitra)                                        
	Bundu (Ranchi), Nov. 19: The arterial NH-33, connecting Ranchi with Jamshedpur, remained choked for six hours from 6.30am today and the Bundu market wore a deserted look as angry villagers threw down the gauntlet to Maoists in reply to yesterdays massacre in Baruhatu.        
	This was arguably the first public protest on such a large scale against Maoist brutality as well as lax police machinery in the state.         
	Four villagers, including an eight-year-old girl, died when rebels opened fire on a house at Baruhatu village, about 8km from Bundu police station and around 50km from Ranchi, last evening. The residents of the house were suspected to be police informers.        
	The deceased included three of a family  Paradeep Munda (30), his brother Sonaram (28) and daughter Rekha. One Sanjay Mahto (29), who had come to the Munda residence for dinner, also died.         
	Twelve-year-old Reshmi Kumari, a neighbour of the Mundas, was injured. She is under treatment at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences.        
	They (Maoists) killed unarmed people, including a sleeping child. Now, we will kill them one by one even if they are armed and dangerous, a protester, brandishing his pharsa (a traditional weapon), said. He added that todays programme should be seen as a message to Maoists that villagers were ready to give a fitting reply to atrocities.         
	The agitators demanded arms and ammunition from the police to fight rebels, besides Rs 10 lakh as compensation and government jobs for the kin of the deceased.         
	They claimed that policemen had failed to turn up at the massacre site before an hour even though their picket was just 400 metres away. They also alleged that the police had stopped patrolling the area after sunset.        
	The villagers were so agitated that additional superintendent of police (ASP) Apoorw had a tough time pacifying them. Equip us with arms and ammunition and give us support by regular police patrolling. We will weed out Naxalism from our area, a youth hollered to the ASP, who tried to convince him that security forces were doing their best to chase away Maoists.        
	The marathon highway blockade resulted in a 4km queue of vehicles. Those stuck in the jam expressed their worries about important assignments pending. I have to make arrangements for my daughters wedding. But here I am caught in a protest, said Satish Singh around noon. He was bound for Mango in Jamshedpur.        
	Shamima Khatoon was seen returning to Ranchi. I had an interview with a private firm. But I will not be able to appear for it as I am already late by an hour, she said when contacted at Bundu Chowk.         
	In Baruhatu, the scene was more sombre. The male members were away and women and children were in no mood to talk to strangers.         
	After much persuasion, Paddoshree, the septuagenarian mother of one of the four victims, Pradeep Munda, spoke. Goli siralak nahi to aaro marten (Maoist bullets got exhausted otherwise more would have been killed), she said in the local Panchpargania dialect, almost delirious with grief.

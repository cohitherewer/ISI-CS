          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Feb. 17: A DNA test today confirmed that a decomposed body found at the height of the Nandigram land war over two years ago was that of Haren Pramanik, a supporter of the Trinamul-led Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee.        
	Additional police chief Dhrubajyoti Dey said the tests had to be done as two other families  of CPM supporters missing around the same time  had also claimed the body.         
	The body, preserved at the State Forensic Science Laboratory in Calcutta, was handed over to Harens widow Shyamali. It had two bullet holes when it was dug up from a mound of earth by CRPF personnel on December 12, 2007.        
	Haren, aged 37 and resident of Kamalpur close to Parulbari, had been missing since November 7.         
	Shyamali had identified her husbands body from his clothes and a talisman. Pratirodh Committee leaders had alleged that CPM cadres had killed him.         
	But the body could not be handed over to Shyamali as the family members of Chanchal Midya and Mohan Mondal, CPM supporters and Nandigram residents who were also missing since November that year, tried to claim it. The dispute prompted the DNA test. Midya and Mondal are still missing.

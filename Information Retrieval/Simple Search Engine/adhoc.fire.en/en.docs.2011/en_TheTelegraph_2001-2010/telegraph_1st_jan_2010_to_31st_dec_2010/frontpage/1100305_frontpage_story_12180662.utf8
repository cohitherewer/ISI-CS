                          Atish Sinha                    
	Calcutta, March 4: Atish Sinha, a former minister in Siddhartha Shankar Rays cabinet between 1972 and 77, died this morning after a heart attack in his south Calcutta home.         
	He was 70 and is survived by his wife, son and daughter.         
	A seven-time MLA, Sinha had for the first time lost to an Independent candidate in 2006, fielded by Behrampore Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury, in the Kandi Assembly seat of Murshidabad.         
	Unable to bear the humiliation, Sinha joined Trinamul Congress in 2008. He was made Murshidabad district Trinamul president.         
	Sinha was the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly between 1996 and 2001. He was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1984, having beaten RSP veteran, the late Tridib Chowdhury, for the Behrampore parliamentary seat.

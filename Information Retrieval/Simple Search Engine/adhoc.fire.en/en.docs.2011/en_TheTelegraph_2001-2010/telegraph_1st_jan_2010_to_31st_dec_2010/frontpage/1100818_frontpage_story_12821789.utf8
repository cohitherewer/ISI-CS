  - Panic-stricken villagers flee Charaipung        OUR CORRESPONDENT                             One of the dismantled huts at Charaipung in Sivasagar. Telegraph picture                                        
	Dibrugarh, Aug. 17: Tension mounted along the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh boundary as police personnel from both the states stood eyeball to eyeball at Charaipung in Sivasagar district today and the neighbouring state warned Assam against further aggression.        
	We have noticed that Assam has been making allegation after allegation against us. This is unacceptable. We will not tolerate any more aggression from Assam, Tirap district superintendent of police Paldan told The Telegraph over phone.         
	The warning came after Arunachal Pradesh police deployed over 150 armed personnel at Naharani, the first border village situated along the states border with Assam.         
	On the other side, Assam police deployed five additional platoons at Charaipung, 70km from Sivasagar town, to match the build-up by Arunachal Pradesh.         
	The build-up is the result of a 100-strong mob from Arunachal Pradesh, backed by goons and militants, attacking the under-construction Charaipung police station in the wee hours on Saturday.         
	On Sunday, gunmen from across the boundary allegedly fired at an Assam police team, which had gone to the area to take stock of the situation.         
	Arunachal Pradesh police, however, alleged that the Assam police team had fired on its villagers without provocation, injuring one of them.         
	Yesterday, Assam police inspector-general (eastern range) L.R. Bishnoi visited Charaipung following which additional police personnel were rushed from 1st Assam Police Battalion headquarters at Ligiripukhuri near Nazira, 2nd Assam Police Battalion at Makum, 11 Assam Police Battalion at Dergaon and 19 Assam Police Battalion at Tengakhat.         
	Sivasagar superintendent of police Akhilesh Singh is also camping in the village for the past three days with a large contingent of police force, a senior police official said.         
	Bishnoi today said the situation was tense but under control.         
	However, there were signs of panic creeping into the border villages. Sources said hundreds of villagers had left their homes and moved to safer places fearing that violence could break out any moment.         
	The area has been witnessing sporadic violence since 1995 when NSCN (Isak-Muivah) militants attacked the police station. There was largescale tension during the last parliamentary elections as well after Tirap district administration set up two polling stations in the disputed area in clear violation of the Supreme Court verdict. The polling stations were later withdrawn following severe pressure from the Assam side.

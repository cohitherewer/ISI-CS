The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Industry, academia join hands

	Sindri/Ranchi, Nov. 29: BIT-Sindri is taking the initiative to constitute a panel of notables from academia and industry that will hold regular interactions to ultimately lead to a broad road map for the development of Jharkhand.        
	To be set up on the advice of science and technology department secretary Sudhir Prasad, the Industry-Institute Forum would comprise leading industrialists who have a stake in Jharkhand along with national and state-based academics.         
	The forum, which BIT-Sindri director S.K. Singh said would be in place within a couple of days, follows chief minister Arjun Mundas move to create a high-level panel of economists, headed by Bibek Debroy, to prepare a development report and chart out a growth path of politically unstable Jharkhand.         
	D.K. Singh, the head of BIT-Sindris electronics and communication engineering department, said that the idea of the forum took concrete shape during a recent industry-academia interaction at the institute where participants realised the need for such a permanent group to brainstorm about the states development.         
	Gone are the days when industries were only concerned with profit making, he said, adding that todays companies would have to consider their social responsibilities.         
	Such a forum, he said, would also help BIT work on live projects, thereby taking care of a perennial industry gripe that the institute was getting bogged down with outdated projects.        
	The forum will also ensure industry had a greater say in deciding the curricula of the institute and make it more relevant to the present times, he said.        
	Singh indicated that among those who would be part of the forum that is supposed to meet every fortnight were the director of Jindal Power Limited (JPL), .P. Jha, and the director of IIM-Raipur B.S. Sahay.         
	Director (technical education) Arun Kumar said such a forum would help both industry and the institute. The state will also benefit from it by way of regular interactions, he said.        
	S.P. Sharan, a senior official of Jindal Steel amp; Power Limited, welcomed the idea and said such a forum would certainly help to ensure balanced industrialisation of the state.         
	We will see how the state gets benefited by it, he added.

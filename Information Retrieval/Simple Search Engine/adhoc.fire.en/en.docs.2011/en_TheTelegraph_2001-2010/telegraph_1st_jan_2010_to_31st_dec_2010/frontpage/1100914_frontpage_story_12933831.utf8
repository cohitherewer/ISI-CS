  - Cabinet clears Anglo-Indian MLA rsquo;s nomination
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Ranchi, Sept. 13: With adequate numbers in his kitty, Arjun Munda is all set to sail through tomorrows vote of confidence in the Assembly with an Opposition that is divided and not quite ready to embarrass the new BJP-JMM-Ajsu government.        
	Munda looked confident, knowing his coalition had the support of 45 MLAs in a House of 81, with the addition of Glen Joseph Gaulstan, whose nomination as an Anglo-Indian member to replace his late father, Joseph P, was approved by the state cabinet today.        
	There is no hitch. We will prove our majority on the floor of the House comfortably, Munda, who held parleys with BJP national general secretary (organisation) Saudan Singh and other office-bearers, said.        
	The daylong session to seek the trust vote will be held at the auditorium of Sri Krishna Institute of Public Administration (Skipa) as the Assembly premises is under renovation.        
	Speaker C.P. Singh inspected the venue and noted that separate chambers had been ensured for the chief minister and MLAs of his coalition and for Opposition MLAs.         
	While the speaker, chief minister, his two deputies and the leader of the Opposition would use fixed microphones, others would use cordless microphones, he spelt out.        
	The Congress, the principal Opposition party, appeared resigned to its fate with its leader, Rajendra Prasad Singh, saying there was no need to frame a strategy with other parties, including JVM and RJD.         
	Both parties are blaming the Congress for the BJP-JMM government formation. Moreover, the numbers are obviously in favour of the ruling alliance, he said.        
	But the JVM seemed determined to use the opportunity to expose the BJP and JMMs unholy alliance, sealed solely to satisfy their lust for power.         
	This government cant ensure political stability. Munda was not going to write a new story. Rather, he will repeat the misdeeds of his past regimes and we will expose them, said JVM legislature party leader Pradeep Yadav.        
	RJD legislature party leader Annapurna Devi said they would oppose the trust vote.         
	But, both the JMM and the Ajsu were unruffled, satisfied that they would sail through the vote. There should be no difficulty in gaining the trust of the House, said Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto.         
	Hemant Soren, leader of the JMM legislature party that held a meeting of party MLAs at Shibu Sorens residence, seconded him, adding that jailed MLA Paulus Surin would attend tomorrows vote since Simdega district judge Narendra Srivastava had granted him permission to attend tomorrows session.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Strikeback begins   Modi raided, Pawar fires
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Strikeback begins     -  Modi raided, Pawar fires
          OUR BUREAU                                                    Modi and Pawar          
	April 15: Income-tax officials today swooped down on the headquarters of the Indian Premier League and an office as well as home of Lalit Modi, the first sign of strikeback by the Centre emerging on a day Sharad Pawar spoke out in support of the besieged IPL chief and Narendra Modis name crept into the controversy.        
	Lalits suite at the Four Seasons hotel in Parel has been sealed and his laptop seized. Till midnight, eight tax sleuths were questioning the IPL boss. Sources said CCTV footage had been collected from the places searched, apparently to identify visitors.        
	The sources added that the tax officials had been asked to despatch the information collated to Delhi before Friday morning. Junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoor, at the centre of the IPL storm, is scheduled to make a statement in Parliament tomorrow.        
	The tax action, variously described as raid, search, source probe (one without a formal complaint) and inquiry, is being seen as an attempt to send a strong message to Lalit and his supporters that the UPA will no longer take matters lying down. The income-tax department, which falls under the finance ministry held by the Congress, would not have stepped in without clearance from the party leadership.        
	The swoop rolled hours after the spokesperson for the Kochi IPL consortium said Lalit was targeting the group under pressure from Gujarat chief minister Modi.                    A car belonging to an income-tax official is parked at the Cricket Centre at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Thursday. (PTI)        
	The political plot thickened tonight with Pawar publicly lending support to Lalit. There is nothing wrong in disclosing the names of the stakeholders to the public, the Union agriculture minister and UPA ally told CNN-IBN, referring to Lalits tweet through which the IPL chief disclosed the shareholding pattern in the Kochi consortium.        
	Pawar sought to clear the air on Narendra Modi, too, saying the Gujarat chief minister had no role in the episode.        
	The former BCCI chief did back Tharoor but his strong defence of Lalit came amid charges that a cabinet minister from Maharashtra had tried to dissuade the consortium from bidding for Kochi.        
	In Parliament, the BJP gave a breather to Tharoor by focusing on the Dantewada massacre but it has threatened to rake up the IPL issue tomorrow. Tharoor met Sonia Gandhi today.        
	However, a little after 5.30pm, the scene of action shifted to Mumbai. Two cars swerved into the compound of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) adjacent to Mumbais Wankhede Stadium and four men stepped out.        
	As the four  it later emerged they were income-tax officials  strode towards the BCCI building, one of them put a finger on his lips to order an advancing guard to be silent. I thought they had come for some secret meeting with the bosses, the guard said later.        
	The four men went to the 4th floor  the dedicated IPL floor in the BCCI office. They did not go to the first floor as everybody does, the guard said. The first floor houses the administration wing headed by Ratnakar Shetty.        
	Lalit was not in the office when the sleuths stepped in. Contacted, Lalit brushed away the visit as a mere inquiry and said he would be at the scene soon. But Lalit did not turn up even after an hour  he had been held back by more IT sleuths at his office in Mumbais Worli for questioning.        
	A Mumbai IT source disputed Lalits claim. We are not conducting any enquiries  we are here to find proof and documents. Unfortunately, they seem to have been destroyed. He claimed they were all destroyed in a fire at his Mumbai house five months ago. We have raided his house as well and will conduct checks on one of his other offices at a hotel from where he runs his new businesses.         
	The tax officials also visited the office of IMG, the IPLs media partner. Another group of officials had earlier gone to the premises of Parinee Developers, which has a 26 per cent stake in the Kochi consortium.

          HENRY SAMUEL                            festival walkout                                  
	Paris, Feb. 2: Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has backed out of singing in Italys San Remo music contest reportedly because she took offence to a song mocking her husband, President Nicolas Sarkozy.        
	Bruni-Sarkozys decision to withdraw from the festival, which runs from February 16 to 21, was revealed by the state channel Rai Uno, which airs the event each year.        
	Massimo Giletti, presenter of the popular culture programmee Arena, said: Carla Bruni has decided not to participate in the Festival of San Remo, where she was to have sung with Gino Paoli on Thursday evening.        
	Among the explanations is the possibility that her appearance was vetoed by the Elyse Palace in annoyance at the song that mocks President Sarkozy.        
	He later backed up his claims by saying he had email proof from the French First Ladys staff. Of course I wouldnt invent such a thing in order to say it on television, he said. The Elyse declined to comment.        
	Meno male, the song said to have irked the former supermodel, is written and sung by Simone Cristicchi.        
	The lyrics mildly suggest that Bruni-Sarkozy uses her charms to distract attention from her husbands political woes. The incriminating line is: Isnt Carla Bruni beautiful? If we talk about you, there are no problems.        
	Italian newspapers noted that the lyrics referred to Meno male che Silvio ce! (thank goodness for Silvio), a slogan used by supporters of the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.        
	San Remo is Italys most popular song festival.        
	Bruni-Sarkozy has also dismissed claims that Sarkozy pulled strings to ensure his rival Dominique de Villepin was given a retrial for trying to smear him.         
	Villepin, a former Premier, was acquitted last week on charges of conspiring to slander Sarkozy in 2004 and wreck his presidential bid.

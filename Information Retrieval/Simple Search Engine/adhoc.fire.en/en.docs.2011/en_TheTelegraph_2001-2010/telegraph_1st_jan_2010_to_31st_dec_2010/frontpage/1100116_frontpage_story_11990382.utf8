	Chicago, Jan. 15 (Agencies): David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Hussain Rana, accused of laying the groundwork for the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai and planning an attack on a Danish newspaper, have been indicted on federal terrorism charges.        
	The indictment, unsealed on Thursday, also charged a retired Pakistani major, Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed, and a leader of the Pakistan-based terrorist outfit Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami, Ilyas Kashmiri.        
	Headley has already been charged in connection with the Mumbai attacks that killed over 160 people but the 12-count indictment expanded the allegations against Rana to include the Mumbai attacks.         
	Both are in federal custody in Chicago.        
	Kashmiri, described as having been in regular contact with al Qaidas No. 3, Sheikh Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, has been indicted in a US court for the first time in connection with a plot to target Jyllands-Posten, the Danish newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet.        
	While Rehman was arrested by Pakistani intelligence agencies and later let off, Kashmiri, said to have close links with al Qaida and the Pakistani arm of the Taliban, is believed to have been sheltered by them in the lawless Waziristan region.        
	A recent Pakistani media report said Kashmiri had a hand in co-ordinating the suicide strike on a CIA base in Khost in eastern Afghanistan that killed eight operatives.        
	US authorities, the report said, have asked Pakistan to hunt down and extradite the terrorist.        
	Kashmiri, from Kotli district of Mirpur in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, was apprehended by the Indian Army in Poonch in the 1990s and jailed for two years, but escaped.        
	After returning to Pakistan, he floated his own faction of the Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami and was arrested in 2003 after an attempt to assassinate then President Pervez Musharraf, but was released in 2004.         
	Officials say the defendants have links with the Lashkar-e-Toiba.         
	List of charges        
	Headley, 49, formerly Daood Gilani, has been charged on 12 counts, including conspiracy to murder and maim people in India and providing material support to a foreign terrorist organisation. The maximum punishment is the death penalty.        
	Rana, also 49, is charged with three counts of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organisation, with a maximum sentence of life in prison.         
	Kashmiri and Rehman, charged with conspiracy to murder and maim people in Denmark, would face a possible death penalty if they were to be brought to the US and convicted.        
	Kasab angle        
	The indictment also said that the Pakistani handlers of the Lashkar terrorists in Mumbai wanted to obtain the release of captured gunman Ajmal Kasab in exchange for the 26/11 hostages.        
	During the course of the attacks, the gunmen were in contact over telephone with three Lashkar leaders  identified as Members A, B and C  all located in Pakistan. LeT Member A also sought to arrange the release of a hostage in exchange for the release of a captured attacker, the chargesheet said.        
	According to the chargesheet, the 10 Pakistani men were given extensive training by Lashkar in July-August 2008.        
	The indictment marks the first appearance in the case for al-Yazid, described as a leader of al Qaidas activities in Afghanistan.        
	Mumbai survey        
	The indictment alleged that Headley attended terror training camps run by Lashkar in Pakistan in 2002 and 2003. He is accused of conducting surveillance of the Mumbai targets during five trips over two years preceding the 2008 attacks.         
	He received approval from Rana in June 2006 to open a Mumbai branch of First World Immigration Service, Ranas company, as a front.         
	Rana told a First World employee to prepare documents supporting the story and showed Headley how to get a visa for travel to India. Headley photographed and videotaped potential targets, including the Taj hotel and other sites that were attacked on 26/11.         
	Danish operation        
	Headley also did a surveillance of Jyllands-Postens offices in the Danish cities of Copenhagen and Aarhus. Rana allegedly sent an email to the newspaper in January 2009, pretending to be interested in placing an ad for First World. The following month, Rehman allegedly took Headley to meet Kashmiri in Waziristan. Kashmiri reviewed Headleys surveillance and suggested using a truck bomb to destroy the papers office. In May, Kashmiri told Headley to meet unnamed contacts in Europe who would provide money, weapons and manpower for the attack. Headley was arrested while the planning was still under way.

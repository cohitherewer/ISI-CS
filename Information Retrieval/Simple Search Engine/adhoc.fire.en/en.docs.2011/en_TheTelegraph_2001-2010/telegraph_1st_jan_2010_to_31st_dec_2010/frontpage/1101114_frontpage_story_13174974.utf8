	Dhaka, Nov. 13: Violent protests broke out today in Bangladesh as the process of evicting former Bangladesh Prime Minister and opposition leader, Khaleda Zia from her three decade old home begun in the morning today.        
	According to local reports at least 50 people were injured and more than 20 protestors were detained in the capital as sporadic violence broke out with news of Zias imminent eviction spreading across the country. Police said that as many as 4,000 protesters carrying sticks and stones not only destroyed vehicles on streets but also set fire to a bus near the house of the former PM. Police had to use batons and fire rubber bullets to disperse hundreds of people who were protesting the eviction.        
	Witnesses said that Zias house inside the army headquarters was cordoned off by a sizeable number of security personnel which triggered the protests. Zia left her home by car for her office outside the area amid the protests.        
	Similar violence erupted near Zias office outside the cantonment area and in 20 other towns in the country. Around 50 more people were injured in clashes with police in Serajganj, 150 km (94 miles) northwest of Dhaka, local television channels said.        
	In a press conference addressed from her office in Dhaka in the evening, Zia alleged that her eviction was a result of state sponsored terrorism and accused the Government of forcibly evicting her. She confirmed that she will now be staying at her brothers residence. Images of Zia in a pink saree breaking down in her office in front of mediamen, flashed across news channels in the country as her supporters went on a rampage.         
	 quot;I was dragged out of my house in the clothes that i was wearing. My family members were assaulted, This is against the spirit of the court ruling, quot; said Zia teary eyed.        
	Local newspapers reported earlier today that Zia had already started moving her household items from her military owned cantonment residence in the last few days expecting her eviction any day.        
	A National English daily in the Capital reported that Zia has already started shifting household items to other places in the capital. She took the items in 51 cartons, four large travel bags, two large luggage and a steel trunk, as of November 10, it said.        
	However, Zias counsel, Mahbubuddin Khokan refuted these reports and said that she had no intention of leaving the house.        
	News channels here report that by afternoon today the military removed 61 people from the house, but Zia stayed inside for a couple of hours with two domestic staff before heading to her office.        
	Her party said she would stay at her brothers home for the time being. However there was no indication from her party if the former PM would move to the official residence designated for the leader of the opposition.        
	Zias close aide Khandaker Delwar Hossain called a dawn-to-dusk general strike across the country on Sunday to protest the governments move.        
	A statement from the militarys public relations office said Zia was leaving the house quot;voluntarily quot; to show respect for a court order, but her party disputed the claim, alleging that her eviction was forced.        
	The High Court on 13 October had asked the government to give Khaleda 30 days time to vacate the cantonment house scrapping a petition of the BNP chairperson, who challenged a government notice for vacating the house. The time expired yesterday.        
	The Supreme Court on 10 November adjourned the hearing on the appeal till 29 November.        
	On Thursday Attorney General Mahbubey Alam said it would not be illegal if the government takes step to evict Khaleda from the cantonment house after 12 November.

	New Delhi, May 26 (PTI): Air India today cancelled another 76 domestic and international flights across the country leaving thousands of passengers stranded on the second day of the strike by the airline's engineers and ground staff.  
	The management late last night threatened to take stern action including termination of service if the strike continued. This has compelled the agitating Air India unions to hold talks with the management over the gag order issue, which mainly sparked off the nation-wide flash strike yesterday.							   
	At least 50 domestic and international flights were cancelled yesterday while several others were delayed by over two hours. Chaotic scenes were witnessed at Air India counters

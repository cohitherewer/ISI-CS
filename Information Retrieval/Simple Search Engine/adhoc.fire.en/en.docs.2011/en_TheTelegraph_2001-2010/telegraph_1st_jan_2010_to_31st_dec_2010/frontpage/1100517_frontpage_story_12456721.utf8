	New Delhi, May 17 (PTI) : From tomorrow onwards, people have to bid adieu to their loved ones from the railway campus and not enter the station premises .The Railways presently decided to stop sale of platform tickets to control crowd inside.  
	The decision came tonight in the wake of a stampede in the railway station, which claimed two lives and injured eight others. 	We will stop the sale of platform tickets from tomorrow. This is aimed at controlling crowd inside the platforms, a Railway official said.							   
	Railway Board member Vivek Sahai said apart from New Delhi station, platform tickets will not be sold in Old Delhi and Hazarat Nizamuddin stations too. Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee was monitoring the situation and had instructed all zonal railway officials to ensure smooth passenger movement during the summer rush, Sahai told.							   
	According to him the stampede was caused as passengers tripped on the staircase and fell on others.

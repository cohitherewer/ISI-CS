The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cash curtains for BBCs Bollywood station
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cash curtains for BBCs Bollywood station
          AMIT ROY                            (Top) Mark Thompson and Tommy Sandhu, the face of the Asian Network				                           
	London, March 2: The BBCs Asian Network, a digital radio station which is aimed at the ethnic minorities but has suffered a sharp fall in its listening audience, is to close as part of a wide-ranging cost cutting and overall strategy review, Mark Thompson, director-general of the corporation, announced today.        
	I wont be shedding any tears for it, was the immediate reaction of a freelance Indian-origin radio producer and director who has managed to get her work accepted by mainstream BBC Radio 4. Some of the presenters on Asian Network have moved on to better jobs but the network has always seemed pretty amateurish to me, she added witheringly but not entirely unfairly.        
	The Asian Network was an attempt by the BBC to provide a service to 2.5 to 3 million listeners of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan origin, with a focus on music aimed at Asian youth and a significant Bollywood content as well.        
	Hindi film stars with a new movie to plug found a convenient platform, just as Hollywood big names are able to call the shots on mainstream BBC programmes.         
	Although most programmes were in English, several hours were set aside for output in Hindi/Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali, Gujarati and Mirpuri. There is a daily soap opera called Silver Street, which is meant to reflect typical British Asian family life, but the last episode will be this month.        
	Quite apart from many potential listeners still not possessing digital radios and therefore not bothering to access the network, the BBC discovered it was very difficult to have one station that could appeal equally to, say, an Indian professor at university and a Mirpuri halal butcher in Bradford  and the social spectrum in between.        
	Although well intentioned, the Asian Network was encouraging a ghetto mentality and paid little attention, for example, to ideas, books, literature, films beyond Bollywood, education, foreign affairs, science, history, contemporary art  and the kind of treatment that finds a home either on BBC Radio 4 or BBC World Service.        
	The Asian Network could close by the end of next year, though there will now be a 12-week consultation period to discuss the wide-ranging strategy report outlined today by Thompson in a presentation to the staff. Leaks had already suggested that the Asian Network had been earmarked for closure.         
	The strategy report said: The Asian Network in particular has failed to build on its early growth and has lost around 20 per cent of its listeners over the past three years. The services current scale appears insufficient to justify the level of BBC investment as a network radio service.        
	Some 33 MPs have signed up to a parliamentary motion expressing deep concern at the prospect of the 6 Music and Asian Network radio stations being closed down. The Early Day Motion, tabled by former digital engagement minister Tom Watson yesterday, insists the BBC has a duty to represent and give a platform to minority interests that need a mainstream platform to develop and grow.        
	Thompson also announced that half of the websites on BBC online will close by 2013.         
	These suffer from the same problem as the Asian Network  India and Pakistan are lumped together as equal countries on the same home page under South Asia so that the relentless diet of stories about terrorism from Pakistan is presented alongside the achievements of Indias Chandrayaan-1 lunar spacecraft.        
	Recognising that the BBC is one of the most important institutions in Britain and indeed the world, the Liberal Democrat culture spokesperson Don Foster said: The decision to focus on high-quality UK content is welcome. However, I am not convinced that using 6 Music and the Asian Network as sacrificial lambs to pay for it is the right approach. While the BBC has become overgrown in some areas and needs pruning, the licence fee-payers must have their say about whats to go.        
	There could now be a political battle to save the Asian Network, however questionable its quality, if MPs think there are votes in it.

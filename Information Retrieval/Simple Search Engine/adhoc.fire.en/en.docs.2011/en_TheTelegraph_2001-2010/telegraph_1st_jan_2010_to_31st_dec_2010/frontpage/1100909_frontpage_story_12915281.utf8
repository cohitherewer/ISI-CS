  - SPOT THE ODD ONE OUT          BISWAJEET BANERJEE                         The photograph featuring the eight Congress workers and Rahul Gandhis cut-out				                                             
	Lucknow, Sept. 8: If you cant meet him, morph him.        
	So did eight devoted Congress workers from Agra, denied permission to meet Rahul Gandhi in Delhi last week.        
	The eight, seven men and one woman, returned home on Saturday with a coveted photograph that showed them rubbing shoulders with Rahul, who is smiling but a bit wooden in hindsight.        
	What is the use of such a photo-op if the momentous occasion stays confined to the family album or the drawing room?         
	They circulated the photograph with a media release that said they had met the AICC general secretary and apprised him of the problems of Agra, particularly of those dealing in leather business. The release added that Rahul listened to them carefully and congratulated them for keeping him abreast of the problems in Agra.         
	The publicity turned out to be the proverbial flaw in the picture perfect crime.        
	Some newspapers published the picture, which not only caught the state Congress leaderships eyeballs but also raised its eyebrows. How come the eight managed the feat of getting across to Rahul without any apparent push from the state unit, so went the question. A round of grilling and a closer look at the photograph let the mouse out of the bag.        
	The eight had morphed the photograph after their sudden request for an appointment with Rahul was turned down by Congress officials in Delhi.        
	They used a cut-out of Rahul so that a more or less life-size image could be morphed onto a photograph of the eight standing below a hoarding featuring Indira Gandhi. The eight possibly took the help of a graphic artist.        
	The eight spilled the beans before the district president of the disciplinary committee, Ram Kishore Dwivedi. All the eight have accepted their mistake. They admitted that they morphed the picture of Rahul Gandhi to get publicity, he said over the phone from Agra.                          
	The eight will now have to stay out of the picture for a year. They have been expelled for a year as punishment.        
	They could have been sacked from the party. Because they admitted their mistake and promised not to repeat it next time, they have been expelled for just one year, Dwivedi said.        
	None of the eight could be contacted for comment.        
	This is not the first time purported proximity to the Gandhi-Nehrus is causing anxious moments for the party or the family. In 2002, Robert Vadra, Priyanka Gandhis husband, had issued a public notice to ensure that some of his relatives do not misuse his name for their personal gain.        
	The Congress, some of whose activists are known for devising ingenious ways to tell the world how close they are to the leadership, has a rich history of idol worship.        
	The skills were on display in Calcutta this week when Rahul came calling.        
	Many of the cut-outs that sprouted along the route taken by Rahul sported prominent footnotes that betrayed the real purpose. The footnotes flashed a name or names of those who took the initiative for the cut-out.        
	One person who had put up Rahul posters with his own name tagged below was Congress councillor Santosh Pathak. Asked why he used his own name on the poster, Pathak said: The idea of printing the names of local party leaders is to make them familiar to the electorate. Moreover, they also feel proud to be part of posters of leaders of the party for which we work relentlessly.        
	With inputs from Anindya Sengupta in Calcutta

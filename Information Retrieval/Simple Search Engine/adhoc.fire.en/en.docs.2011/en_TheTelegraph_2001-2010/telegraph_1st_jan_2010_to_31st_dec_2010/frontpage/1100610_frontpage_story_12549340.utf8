  - Disgruntled, unpaid contractors in Nagagholee demand funds from govt        OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Swirling waters gnaw at Nagagholee near Dibrugarh. Picture by Eastern Projections            Anti-erosion measures stalled at Nagagholee on Wednesday. Picture by Eastern Projections                                
	Dibrugarh, June 9: Contractors today suspended work on anti-erosion projects in endangered Nagagholee and Mohonaghat for lack of payment, just 10 days after water resources minister Prithibi Majhi declared that funds would not be a problem.        
	Confirming this to The Telegraph, the executive engineer of the water resources department, Dibrugarh division, G. Kalita, said the department had to stop work as there was no sanction from the government till date.         
	Yes, not a single paisa has been sanctioned by the government till date. The contractors had been putting severe pressure on me for funds. But just tell me from where will I get the funds? It has to be sanctioned by the government, which right now has not been done, a furious Kalita said.        
	A raging Brahmaputra has been eating at Nagagholee, just 3km from Dibrugarh town, threatening to wipe out Dinjan army base, Mohanbari airport and Assam Medical College and Hospital.        
	At the two sites, loads of boulders lay unattended to as frustrated contractors and their workers abandoned the site indefinitely early this morning.        
	We had made it clear that we had agreed to work because the very existence of Dibrugarh was at stake. We have already spent Rs 5 crore without any sanction or any official work order. Therefore, we are helpless, Chandreswar Saikia, a contractor, said.         
	Around 200 contractors and thousands of labourers were engaged by the water resources department to take up urgent anti-erosion work at Nagagholee.         
	The water resources department had installed around 1,437 RCC porcupines and 1,599 boulder cases at Nagagholee to arrest the river from washing away chunks of land.         
	A source in the department here said officials had prepared a plan and estimate amounting to around Rs 15 crore to deal with the erosion, but there has been no response from the government so far.        
	Kalita had earlier disclosed that the state revenue department had not cleared two proposals of Rs 5 crore each for Nagagholee and a Rs 2.6-crore project for Mohonaghat.         
	This despite repeated promises from all quarters, including from chief minister Tarun Gogoi during his visit to Nagagholee on May 29 that the government would do everything to check erosion.         
	It is really a shocking state of affairs. On the one hand, the chief minister himself is promising to save the people from erosion with whatever resources are required, on the other, contractors had to stop work because of non-availability of funds. Is this the way the government runs? asked Robin Kurmi, a local resident.         
	The dredger which the water resources department had hired from the Inland Water Authority of India (IWAI) to dredge the river at Nagagholee was nowhere in sight today.         
	The Nagagholee Erosion Monitoring Committee alleged that bringing in the dredger to channelise the Brahmaputra and shift it to its original course by removing huge sand islands (char-chapori) was a mere eye wash.         
	It (the dredger) functioned only on two occasions, once when Majhi had visited Nagagholee on May 28 and second when the chief minister had come, Sanjib Prasad, the secretary of the committee, said.         
	Various parties and organisations had threatened to launch a massive agitation against the governments alleged betrayal.         
	General secretaries of the Asom Yuba Parishad, the youth wing of the AGP, Sunil Rajkonwar and Teros Gowala, lambasted the chief minister and the water resources minister today.         
	Yesterday, the Assam Water Resources Contractors Association had set a weeks deadline to Dispur to release Rs 100 crore sanctioned by the Centre, failing which it would stop all ongoing work on embankments.         
	The association blamed the water resources department for the delay in the release of funds, adding that it should not be held responsible if the people suffer because of their decision.         
	The Centre had released the funds in March.        
	Drowned: A guard at the Kaziranga National Park was feared drowned today when he fell off the elephant he was riding.

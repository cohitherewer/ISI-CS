The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | France sends alert to burqa-clad visitors 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                France sends alert to burqa-clad visitors 
          ARCHIS MOHAN                            Jerome Bonnafont                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: France today asked women visiting or hoping to migrate to the country to stay away if they wear, or plan to continue wearing, the niqaab or burqa  the full veil worn by Muslim women with just a slit for the eyes.        
	The French ambassador to India, Jerome Bonnafont, said a law to ban wearing of the garment in public places would be enacted soon. The country is only willing to allow hijaab (headscarf) or a veil, as worn by nuns.        
	Bonnafont said wearing a burqa or niqaab in public places was against Frances principles of secularism, freedom and equality. If someone does not feel at ease with French laws, why should they stay in France.        
	The French perceive burqa or niqaab also as a security threat. Muslims comprise five million, around 7.7 per cent, of Frances 65-million population, the largest in Europe. Most of them are from former French colonies in west and sub-Saharan Africa. Islam is the countrys second-most practised religion, with 1,900 mosques.        
	The French government estimates that 2,000 women, most of them migrants from Africa, wear the burqa or niqaab outside home. Surveys haveclaimed to have found that most of these women wear the garment under systematic pressure from their fathers or brothers or husbands.         
	But Bonnafont appeared to question the practice. They have chosen to come to France, which means they accept (the need) to abide by French laws and not challenge them.        
	The government has consulted Muslim religious heads and experts at home and abroad, including Cairo Universitys director and the rector of the Jeddah Mosque, to get the Qurans view on the subject.         
	The experts believe there is no religious prescription to wear the garments and the social practice stems from local customs.        
	Bonnafont said those insisting on making the burqa compulsory for Muslim women had a political agenda.         
	In a survey of women wearing the garment, the majority admitted they wore it under compulsion. A 32-member parliamentary commission had also recommended not allowing the burqa or niqaab in public.        
	The French dismiss allegations that the law banning such garments is draconian, and point out that women can wear a veil if they want.         
	Students in government-funded schools were recently banned from displaying religious symbols. But such symbols are allowed in private schools, where 20 per cent of the students study.         
	Prime Minister Francois Fillon has sought legal advice from the Council of State, the highest administrative court in France, on the feasibility of passing a law to ban wearing the full veil in public places.

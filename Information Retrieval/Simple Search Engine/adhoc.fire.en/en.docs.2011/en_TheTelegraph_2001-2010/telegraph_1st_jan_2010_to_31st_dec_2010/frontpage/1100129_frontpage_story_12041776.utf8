The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | IPL teams set to hire some Pak players
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                IPL teams set to hire some Pak players
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Abdul Razzaq and Lalit Modi                          
	Mumbai, Jan. 28: Caught in a diplomatic row that is threatening to explode, Indian Premier League teams are set to make amends by picking four to five Pakistani cricketers for Season 3 scheduled to begin on March 12.        
	Among the cricketers expected to be made an offer are Shahid Afridi, Umar Akmal, Umar Gul and Abdul Razzaq, the last two being on the radar of the Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	The turnaround follows home minister P. Chidambarams assertion that the government never nudged the IPL to ban Pakistani players.        
	In the next three to four days, you will see at least four to five Pakistani players picked up. Apart from the Rajasthan Royals, nobody else has the funds to recruit more foreign players, but a way will be found, said a source in the Knight Riders, owned by actor Shah Rukh Khan and friends.        
	As of now, the only way to accommodate the Pakistanis will be by dropping unavailable or injury-ridden foreign players.        
	The Knight Riders are keen to offload knee injury-hit Bangladeshi Mashrafe Mortaza and South African Charl Langeveldt in favour of Razzaq and Gul.        
	They have been on our wish list for a long time and we are in touch with them. But we will finalise everything only after due approvals come from the IPL organisers, said a KKR source.        
	Razzaq has been at the centre of a controversy following Pakistan Cricket Board chief Ijaz Butts announcement that he may play with the Deccan Chargers.        
	The Chargers have officially denied any such move after IPL commissioner Lalit Modi said they did not have enough funds to buy the all-rounder.         
	But sources said interest had been shown and contact established with Razzaq over the phone last weekend after it became clear that the Chargers top bowler Fidel Edwards would be unavailable for Season 3.        
	Contact had been established but there was nothing more. Unlike some other teams, we have both a slot and some money ($30,000) left in our auction purse. We did want Razzaq, but not at the cost of others. The IPL has told us we cannot go over the amount left in our purse, and Razzaqs base price is $50,000. If we want a replacement for the injured foreign player in our team, we have to seek somebody else from the auction list put up by the IPL, the Chargers source said.        
	KKR captain Sourav Ganguly said he had no knowledge of any move to recruit Razzaq, and added that the issue of Pakistani players was between the IPL and the government. Shah Rukh has openly said he wanted Razzaq and expressed dissatisfaction that Pakistani players were ignored.         
	A source in Karan Johars Dharma Productions said that with My Name is Khan due for release in February, the actor was concerned the move could have a negative fallout in the overseas market, where he has a large fan following among both Pakistanis and Indians.        
	None of the 11 Pakistani players put up for auction on January 19 were bid for, sparking outrage in the neighbouring country. The issue took on a political hue with Pakistan cancelling an India trip by a parliamentary delegation.         
	Over the past few days, political pressure has mounted on the IPL teams with home minister Chidambaram terming the non-inclusion of the Pakistani players a disservice to cricket. Today, superstar Amitabh Bachchan said that leaving out the cricketers was something that should not have happened.        
	IPL chief Modi has sought to pin the move on the teams, saying the franchisees decide on their own.        
	Across the board, franchisee sources claimed today that though the final decision was theirs, IPL officials did prod them.        
	The IPL should not pass the buck and say the decision on Pakistani players was all ours. There was a buzz around the risk factors, including the Pakistani players. It was started informally by the IPL organisers. As corporate entities, we were wary and decided to steer clear (of the Pakistani players) after the discouragement, said a Chargers source.        
	Several IPL team sources confirmed that the organisers had verbally discouraged them from picking Pakistani cricketers.        
	A meeting took place sometime after we returned from an IPL workshop in Bangkok. It was a closed meeting with team owners, and even team CEOs were not present there, said a team source.        
	A few weeks before the auction, Umar Akmal was number one on our shopping list. Then, all of a sudden, there was advice that he should be considered unavailable, that it was part of a corporate risk mitigation strategy that came up after the organisers  in an indirect way  indicated that picking Pakistani players may be risky, said a top source in the Rajasthan Royals.        
	The team is now likely to include a couple of Pakistani players. This decision to pick Pakistani players too follows a verbal instruction from the IPL to try and accommodate them, said the Royals source.

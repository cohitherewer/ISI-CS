          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 2: Jharkhand government today cleared financial incentives to the tune of Rs 15 crore for five companies in continuation of its industry-friendly approach demonstrated recently when it okayed similar sops to 53 small and medium scale enterprises.        
	A screening committee headed by chief secretary A.K. Singh met today  after three years  and pored over long-pending proposals of 10 companies that had applied for certain incentives offered by the state to those who sought them within six months of beginning production. Capital incentive, ranging between 15 and 25 per cent of the investment, was offered to only Balmukund Steel, Giridih.        
	VAT reimbursement incentives were cleared for four companies, namely, JMT Auto, Jamshedpur Neelanchal Steel, Seraikela, and Lafarge India Ltd, Jamshedpur.         
	According to sources, the committee rejected capital incentive proposals from six companies since they applied late, i.e. after six months of production. These were Kohinoor Steel, Seraikela; Jharkhand Ispat, Ramgarh; Ram Krishna Forging, Aiada; Vallabh Steel, Seraikela; and Inox Air Products, Bokaro.         
	There were some problems with the date of production quoted by Hindalco Industries, Muri. Also, there were lacunae in proposals of Balalji Industrial Ltd, Chaibasa, and Ativir Industrial Ltd, Giridih.         
	The industries director was asked to review the proposals with date issues.        
	Another capital incentive proposal, that of Bihar Sponge, Chandil, that was reviewed today, was also rejected.        
	Companies whose VAT (value added tax) reimbursement proposals were cleared included JMT Auto, Jamshedpur Neelachal Steel, Seraikela, and Lafarge India Ltd, Jamshedpur. Proposals of Inox Air Products, Adhunik Steel, Bihar Caustic, Chandil, and Ram Krishna Forging were rejected. ACC Cement, Jhinkpani, was granted time to reclaim the reimbursement.         
	The VAT proposal of Balmukund Steel, Giridih, will be taken up at the next meeting.         
	Incentives are being offered to industrial units on capital investment, captive power generation, interest paid to banks, stamp duty and registration, employment generation-based incentives, special incentives for thrust areas/ SC/ST/women/ ex-servicemen and handicapped persons, feasibility study-project report cost reimbursement subsidy and pollution control equipment subsidy.

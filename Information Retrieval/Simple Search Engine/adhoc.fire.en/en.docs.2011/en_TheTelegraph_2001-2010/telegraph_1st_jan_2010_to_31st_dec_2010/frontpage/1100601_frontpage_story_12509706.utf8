          K.P. NAYAR                            Barack Obama: Senator Schumer belongs to the Presidents party                                        
	Washington, May 31: With US mid-term congressional elections approaching, outsourcing of American jobs to countries like India is once again being cynically made into an issue here.        
	New Yorks senior senator, Charles Schumer, announced yesterday that he was taking steps which will make it mandatory for companies here to automatically inform customers when the calls they make to corporate service locations are being transferred to call centres abroad.        
	A legislation which the Democratic senator plans to table in the Senate also requires 25 cents to be levied as tax on every call that a company routes to a call centre outside the US.        
	The charge would be levied on the company that outsources such calls.        
	This bill will not only serve to maintain call centre jobs currently in the US, but also provide a reason for companies that have already outsourced jobs to bring them back, the senator announced in his statement released to news agencies.        
	Schumer is a master of election strategies in his party: as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee until last year, he was the brain behind a total of 14 Democratic victories in Senate elections during a four-year period which brought the chamber under the partys control.        
	Although Schumer made way for Senator Robert Menendez of neighbouring New Jersey in preparation for Novembers elections, he is still a key strategist in the party and one of its top leaders.        
	With few issues favouring Democrats as they appear to be sliding into defeat in November, Schumer has cycnically calculated that reviving the outsourcing issue as campaign fodder may help them at the hustings.        
	Republicans are generally viewed as being in greater favour of globalisation of businesses and outsourcing as a way of making American enterprises more competitive. It is likely that Schumer also reckons that championing the cause of American jobs in times of high unemployment here will persuade trade unions to cough up more money for his partys candidates.        
	A recent US Supreme Court judgment has freed companies from the limits imposed on them for making election contributions. Big corporations tend to give more to Republicans and trade unions generally support Democrats.        
	Under Schumers legislation, US companies would have to obtain certification every year from the Federal Trade Commission that they were complying with the requirements in his bill and pay fines otherwise.        
	In the coming election, the Republicans have made immigration, mainly from Latin America, into a potentially vote-catching issue in states which border Mexico, which has a large illegal immigrant population in the US.        
	The outsourcing issue has similar xenophobic potential to get votes because customers here often complain of foreign accents when their calls are routed to centres abroad and xenophobes imagine that they are getting poor service only because those handling such calls are non-Americans.        
	Every two years since 2004, during the election season, politicians like Schumer have revived the issue of US jobs going abroad to call centres in India, South Africa and the Philippines in particular.        
	It remains to be seen whether the New York senators bill will languish once the elections are over  like many other such pieces of legislation in states  or whether he will pursue it even after the congressional polls.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Itanagar, May 27: In a major breakthrough, Arunachal Pradesh police arrested Khargeswar Basumatary, one of the accused in the Panbazar blast, from Ziro, the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district this evening.         
	Deputy superintendent of police T. Teki said a police team arrested Basumatary from Ziro Hapoli highway around 6.30pm. The team, led by officer-in-charge of Ziro police station Tab Techi, made the arrest after a tip-off from an Assam Police team that arrived at Ziro yesterday.        
	Local TV channels have been beaming photographs of the accused. The Telegraph, too, carried pictures released by the CBI, including that of Basumatary today. The CBI had alerted the Arunachal police yesterday.        
	The police team from Assam had arrived with a photograph of Basumatary, who was staying at Ziro with a woman. The accused tried to give us the slip by fleeing from the hotel in a taxi. We got hold of the taxi driver, who provided Basumatarys cell number. We contacted and managed to catch him, Teki said.         
	The DSP said Basumatary, who belonged to the anti-talks NDFB, was wanted for several other crimes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | iPad makes women cringe
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                iPad makes women cringe
          CLAIRE CAIN MILLER                            The iPad on display in San Francisco. (AFP)                                  
	New York, Jan. 28: When Apple announced the name of its tablet computer yesterday  the iPad  our minds immediately went to the feminine hygiene aisle at the drugstore. It turns out we were not alone.        
	The term iTampon quickly became a trending topic on Twitter because of Tweets like this one: Heavy flow? Theres an app for that! A CNBC anchor, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, said the iPad was a terrible name for the tablet.         
	Are there any women in Apple marketing? asked Brooke Hammerling, founder of Brew Media Relations, a technology public relations firm. The first impression of every single woman Ive spoken to is that its cringe-inducing. It indicates to me that there wasnt a lot of testing or feedback.        
	It is not just women who were surprised. When Peter Shankman, a public relations expert, saw the name on television, he was taken aback. Im waiting for the second version that comes with wings, he said.        
	 Shankman was surprised that Apple, with its attention to detail, missed the significance. So if the name is a bit tone-deaf, at least to half the population, will it hurt sales of the iPad?         
	In three months time, if it delivers on its promise, no ones going to remember that they chuckled about it, said Hayes Roth at Landor Associates.

	This phase covers as many as 999 panchayats where 40,471 candidates are in the fray for 12,011 posts of gram panchayat members, mukhiyas, panchayat samiti members and zilla parishad members. The electorate strength is over 32.58 lakh.        
	Polling parties have already been dispatched to the 9,914 polling stations. In a few places, we have had to airdrop personnel, but we are hopeful of peaceful and fair polls tomorrow, state election commissioner S.D. Sharma told newsmen while briefing them here today.         
	Porahat forest in West Singhbhum, Chainpur and Raidih blocks in Gumla district, Latehars Manika and Barwadih blocks, Jhumra Pahad in Bokaros Gomia block, Kuchai block in Seraikela-Kharsawan district, Shikaripara, Kathikund and Gopikandar in Dumka district have all been identified as sensitive areas by the state police.

	State police spokesperson R.K. Mallick, who is also inspector general (operations), said 710 companies of police personnel have been deputed for tomorrows poll. Of the 710 companies, 175 would comprise central paramilitary forces and there would be five companies of Bihar Military Police (BMP) on duty as well.

	In the second phase, over 600 companies of forces were deputed in 23 districts. Electioneering was peaceful in both phases.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rear admiral dies at firing range
          JOHN MARY AND OUR DELHI BUREAU                            Rear Admiral Jamwal  and a pistol similar to   the one he fired                          
	July 7: The second-in-command of the Southern Naval Command, Rear Admiral Satyendra Singh Jamwal, died of a gunshot wound at a small-arms firing range in Kerala this morning, the highest ranking officer to die in such a manner in recent memory.        
	A rear admiral in the navy is equivalent to a major general in the army. The 51-year-old Jamwal was chief of staff of the Southern Naval Command in Kochi, the commercial capital of the southern state, and a former aide-de-camp to the President.        
	The mysterious death of the senior officer, who had studied in celebrated institutions and was in Calcutta in 2005 to assume command of a guided missile frigate, threw up a host of questions.        
	Navy spokesperson Commodore M.R. Ajaya Kumar said the officer died when a pistol he was checking went off accidentally at the firing range of the gunnery school, INS Dronacharya, at Fort Kochi around 10.30am. A board of inquiry, headed by a vice-admiral, is investigating.        
	However, a senior police officer in Kochi said preliminary investigations suggested suicide and the reason could be domestic discord. Admiral Jamwal fired two rounds into the target and the third behind his temple, the police officer said on the basis of the inquiry and the inquest report.         
	Hailing from Jammu and Kashmir, Jamwal is survived by wife Geeta, a daughter who is doing her graduation and a son who has just joined an engineering college in Manipal.        
	The police inquiry revealed that the bullet had pierced the head 1cm above the right ear and exited 3cm above the left ear. The bullet hit the rear admiral from point-blank range, according to the police officer.        
	Asked about the navys official version, he said the military could not term it a suicide lest it affected the morale of the force.        
	However, Commodore Kumar ruled out rumours of a suicide, asking whether a senior officer needed to go to a firing range to kill himself.        
	Kumar said Jamwal had gone to inspect the firing practice of the Sagar Prahari Bal, the new coastal security force at INS Dronacharya. The rear admiral also took part in the firing practice.        
	First, he fired the Insas rifle. Then, he changed to a pistol (9mm). The pistol misfired twice. He was trying to identify the cause when it went off. Unfortunately, the muzzle was pointed towards him. He was accompanied by his staff officer and other officers in charge of the range, Kumar said.        
	Yesterday, I met him around 7pm when he was taking a walk with his daughter. He was always happy, Kumar added.        
	Whether a freak accident or suicide, the death sent shock waves through the naval base because an officer of Jamwals experience would have in his 30 years of service fired the weapon at least 4,500 times.        
	All serving military officers have to practise small arms firing at least twice a year. Each officer fires a minimum of 150 rounds from different weapons at different ranges in accordance with the APA  annual practice allowance  that is stipulated.        
	The officer, a former bodybuilding champion in the services, was firing from an Indian ordnance factories-made FN GP35 Browing 9mm pistol, the standard issue personal weapon for military officers.        
	Jamwal picked up the rank of rear admiral in September last year and took over as the chief of staff in the southern facility, the training command of the navy. He was a familiar figure in naval headquarters in New Delhi when he was joint director of staff requirement and director, naval operations.        
	Commissioned in the executive branch of the navy on July 1, 1980, Jamwal was a surface warfare officer and later specialised in anti-submarine warfare.        
	He was an alumnus of Lawrence School, Sanawar, the National Defence Academy, Grechko Naval War College in the then USSR, Defence Services Staff College at Wellington and Army War College at Mhow.        
	Jamwal was the commissioning commanding officer of the guided missile frigate, INS Beas, when it was launched in Calcutta in 2005. Immediately before taking over as the chief of staff in the south, he was naval attache at the Indian embassy in Moscow.

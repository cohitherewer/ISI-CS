          OUR BUREAU                                    
	March 1: The Naga talks will resume in Delhi tomorrow amid hopes of an early solution to the long-drawn impasse in Nagaland. But the loudest cheer went up in neighbouring Manipur today as Nagas in four hill districts made a combined clamour to live together with our brethren.        
	A highly placed source in the NSCN (I-M) said the talks would resume with meetings between Naga leaders with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister P. Chidambaram tomorrow. Th. Muivah will meet Manmohan Singh tomorrow. This will be followed by a meeting with the home minister, a senior functionary of the NSCN (I-M), who did not want to be named, told The Telegraph at Camp Hebron near Dimapur.        
	NSCN sources based in Nagaland and those who are in Delhi said the talks this time would be crucial as they have reached a deadlock. They said the two-day scheduled talks would be extended if there was progress. It may be extended depending on the progress of the talks, the senior NSCN official said.        
	Muivah and the outfits chairman Isak Chishi Swu lost the third member of the collective leadership after the NSCN (I-M) vice-president Khadao Yanthan died this evening after prolonged illness.         
	Yanthan, 89, passed away at his Lakhuti home in Wokha district.         
	NSCN (I-M) sources said Yanthan was suffering from old age-related complications. The outfit yesterday dispatched a group of officials to visit the ailing leader.         
	On a proposed visit of Muivah to Nagaland, the groups sources said it would also depend on the progress in the talks.        
	During the meeting, the NSCN general secretary will be accompanied by V.S. Atem, convenor of the steering committee, the highest policy making body of the group, Tongmath Konyak and Johny Dibulong, both members of the steering committee and Vikiye Sumi, kilonser (minister) for education.        
	While the Centre said this time there would be no discussion on sovereignty and Naga integration issues, Muivah, as soon as he landed in Delhi, categorically said the NSCN (I-M) would not compromise on sovereignty.        
	The Centre had prepared a 29-point counter proposal for the discussions this time, which includes financial sops and greater autonomy. The government had in 2006 offered a 1986 Mizo Accord-type solution to the NSCN (I-M), which was rejected.        
	The NSCN sources said the Centre has in principle accepted joint defence and foreign affairs and a common currency.        
	In March 2006, at the initiative of the Centre, a Naga delegation visited Bougainville in Papua New Guinea to study the Bougainville peace process. They met several top government officials of Papua New Guinea and Bougainville. The Naga delegation was also accompanied by representatives of Kreddha, a Netherlands-based NGO which studies and promotes the peaceful resolution of internal conflicts in countries in different parts of the world.        
	The Naga delegation also studied the constitutional framework and arrangements for managing and implementation of the Bougainville Peace Agreement.        
	During his visit to the state last week, Union home secretary G.K. Pillai was urged by representatives of Western Sumi Hoho to convey to Delhi that all underground groups should be taken on board before a solution is arrived at.        
	While reacting to the proposed talks between the Muivah and the central leaders, the NSCN (Khaplang) said one group could never bring a solution to the Naga issue. The NSCN (I-M) has opposed to the involvement of the rival group for the talks saying they were the only mandated group by the Naga people.        
	In response to the NSCN (K) opposing tomorrows talks, the NSCN (I-M) termed them as idiots with no future political vision for the Naga people.        
	Ukhrul rally: Nagas in Manipur today rallied behind NSCN (I-M) to strengthen the hands of the collective leadership of the Naga rebel group in the upcoming talks.        
	Thousands of Nagas took out simultaneous processions in the headquarters of four Naga-dominated districts of Chandel, Tamenglong, Ukhrul and Senapati districts demanding an acceptable and honourable settlement of the Naga issue.        
	The rally was organised by various Naga organisations in the four districts under the aegis of United Naga Council (UNC).        
	The mood in Ukhrul, the home district of Muivah, was a mixture of hope and anger. The rallyists, comprising students, social and church activists and common people were hopeful that tomorrows talks could be a turning point towards realising their dream of freedom and integration but also expressed anger that the dialogue was dragging on.         
	During tomorrows talks, the Centres interlocutor R.S. Pandey would place before the NSCN (I-M) leaders the governments proposal to resolve the Naga problem.        
	We want an early solution. We want to live together as one nation. There were 50 rounds of talks. But nothing is coming. We have set our minds to fight back until our aspiration is achieved, said W.A. Shimray, president of Tangkhul Katamnao Saklong (a student group).              
	As the supporters started marching from the Kharasom junction and Hungdung, 7km and 10km from the rally venue, shops downed shutters in Ukhrul. Similarly, all shops in the other district headquarters were closed during the peace march. The marchers chanted We want justice, We support peace talks and Militarisation down down.        
	A leader of the outfit, Phungthing Shimrang, said the body of Yanthan would be brought to their council headquarters at Camp Hebron where he would be buried as he wished.        
	A special function will also be held for late leader where NSCN/GPRN officials will pay their last respects.         
	Yanthan, before joining the NSCN (I-M), was with the Naga National Council but differences cropped up over the leadership issue which forced him to join the NSCN as vice-president. He was in London for many years along with A.Z. Phizo, the founder of the NNC.        
	Yanthan, who belonged to the Lotha tribe, had hundreds of Lotha followers in the outfit. He was also regarded as a die-hard Naga nationalist.

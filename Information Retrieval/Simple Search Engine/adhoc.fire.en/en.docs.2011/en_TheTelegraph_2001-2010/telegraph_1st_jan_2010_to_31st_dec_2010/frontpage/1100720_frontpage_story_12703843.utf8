	Dharmabad, July 19: Maharashtras Dharmabad and Andhra Pradeshs Nizamabad were twins all these years. But since Chandrababu Naidus arrest on Friday, the siblings seem to be drifting apart  over water.        
	Dharmabad, where Naidu was held for trying to visit the disputed Babhali project on the Godavari, wore a garrison-town look: Maharashtra cops stood like a wall along the border check posts, some even on farmland.         
	Shiv Sena cadres streamed into Dharmabad, in Nanded district. Just across the border in Andhra, supporters of Naidus Telugu Desam milled around.        
	Andhra claims that the Babhali project will deny the state its share of water awarded under the Godavari water disputes tribunal.        
	The tensions could rise because the remand of Naidu and 73 Desam leaders and activists was today extended to July 26. They refused to accept bail, like they had done after being arrested on Friday, claiming they were illegally held in Andhra territory and the Maharashtra government had no right to try them. The leaders will be shifted to Aurangabad district jail by this evening.        
	Maharashtra police wielded batons on Desam demonstrators trying to enter Dharmabad, leaving 15 of them injured. Earlier, Desam workers had tried to obstruct people coming in from Maharashtra. Desam activists burnt effigies of Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan and Sonia Gandhi in Andhra.         
	The Desams bandh today against Naidus arrest was partially successful. The Sena, in turn, has called a Nanded bandh tomorrow in protest against the Desams agitation.

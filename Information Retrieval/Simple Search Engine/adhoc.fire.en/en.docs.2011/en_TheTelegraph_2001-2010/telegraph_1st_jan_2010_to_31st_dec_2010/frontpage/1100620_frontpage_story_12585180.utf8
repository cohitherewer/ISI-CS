	New Delhi, June 19: Lifestyle changes that combat 10 risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking and pot bellies could dramatically reduce the incidence of stroke in India and 21 other countries, a study has suggested.         
	The study by an international medical team has shown that 10 risk factors can explain 90 per cent of strokes in 22 countries. Although these risk factors are well known, the researchers say the findings are significant because of their uniformity across six continents and because they reveal the vast potential of lifestyle choices to prevent strokes.        
	A stroke is a condition in which blood flow to the brain gets obstructed may prove fatal or cause paralysis and lead to long-term disability.        
	The findings show that high blood pressure is the most important risk factor for stroke -- a person with high blood pressure is at 2.6 times higher risk of stroke than someone with normal blood pressure.        
	The study, published in the journal Lancet on Friday, has also shown that smokers are at double the risk of stroke when compared with non-smokers --- and smoking accounted for one of every five strokes.        
	The study -- among the largest to compare risk factors for strokes -- was based on an analysis of the lifestyles of 3,000 stroke patients in 22 countries and 3,000 others who had not suffered stroke. Doctors say the uniformity of risk factors is striking.        
	Lifestyle changes alone can prevent a huge number of strokes everywhere  thats the key message from these results, said Denis Xavier, a team member from the St Johns Medical College, Bangalore.        
	A lot of medical funds and research studies are currently focused at trying to identify the genetic factors that might underlie stroke, Xavier said. These findings show that lifestyle-related factors account for nine in 10 strokes.        
	An analysis of food consumption indicated that a healthy diet including fish and fruits reduces the chance of a stroke. High levels of physical activity and moderate consumption of alcohol also reduced the risk of stroke. But more than 30 drinks a month or binge drinking was associated with increased risk compared with those who do not drink.        
	These results should dispel the idea that there could be differences in risk factors between different ethnic groups in different parts of the world, said Anoop Misra, a consultant endocrinologist in New Delhi who was not associated with the study.        
	In the past, individual studies from different countries had prompted some doctors to suggest that specific risk factors might be more important in some countries than others. For instance, there was some degree of uncertainty whether abdominal fat or high blood pressure might be more important risk factors in some population groups or regions of the world than in others.        
	Doctors say the lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of stroke would be similar to those that help reduce the risk of heart disease or diabetes -- steps to lower blood pressure, cessation of smoking, promotion of physical activity and healthy diet.         
	Strokes jeopardise lives and productivity -- but this new study suggests that in all populations -- regardless of ethnic background or geography -- if you take care of these 10 factors, you can reduce the incidence of stroke, Misra said.         
	The study covered high, middle and low-income countries -- Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Columbia, Croatia, Denmark, Equador, Germany, India, Iran, Malaysia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Sudan and Uganda.

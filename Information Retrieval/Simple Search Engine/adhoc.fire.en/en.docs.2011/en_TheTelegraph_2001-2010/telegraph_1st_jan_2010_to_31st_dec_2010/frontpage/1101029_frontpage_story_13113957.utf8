The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Day One: Women at the fore 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Day One: Women at the fore

	Ormanjhi (Ranchi), Oct. 28: The mood was euphoric at the Ormanjhi, Kanke and Ratu block offices today as aspiring candidates, including a formidable womens brigade, trooped in to file their nominations for the first phase of the first-ever panchayat polls in the state.         
	Though hundreds of hopefuls gathered at the block offices since morning, only four got off the block right away and filed their nominations. The others spent hours trying to figure out the formalities involved to ensure error-free papers, while yet others went about re-acquainting themselves with fellow villagers and renewing contacts so that they were remembered on the all-important polling day.        
	Making their presence felt strongly were the women, emboldened to step out of the four walls of their homes by the Jharkhand Panchayati Raj Act which has reserved 58 per cent of the seats for them.         
	How long will we remain inside our homes? The time has come to take the lead. I will not only contest but will also win the poll and work for the holistic development of my panchayat, said Ratan Devi, a candidate for the mukhiyas post in Kucchu panchayat. A resident of Kulhi, Ratan has studied up to Class X, and is already the president of her villages education committee.         
	To ensure success, Ratan will only file her nominations on November 2. My pundit has told me thats my lucky date, she said.         
	The Kucchu gram panchayat mukhiyas post is reserved for women and Ratan has competition from at least a dozen others who are on the verge of stepping into the fray.         
	As the main occupation of villagers in the two blocks of Ormanjhi and Kanke is farming, developing irrigation facilities is priority for almost all the prospective candidates.         
	I may not be educated but I realise the importance of good irrigation. It will be my priority. I also want to ensure that children have access to quality education right from primary level, said Munni Devi, who would be contesting for the post of mukhiya from Kucchu like Ratan. She may have studied up to Class IX, but her children have access to a computer at home.         
	In Ratu block, Kamal Oraon, a resident of Hurhuri panchayat, was among the four in the district to file nomination. While candidates for mukhiyas post have to file their nominations in the office of the circle officer, those vying for ward members posts would have to file papers in the office of the BDO.         
	Meanwhile, the Ranchi district administration has sought an explanation from two panchayat sevaks of Kanke block for reportedly tampering with the voters list.

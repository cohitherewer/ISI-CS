  - CM berates home minister   over letter, Telangana        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                          
	Calcutta, Jan. 3: If Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has his way, the Harvard-educated P. Chidambaram may have to hire an editor to trim the home ministers letters and a public relations adviser to ensure he does not upset the entire country.        
	The chief minister today tore into the Union home minister, delivering homily after homily for questioning the effectiveness of the Bengal governments drive against Maoists.        
	Bhattacharjee also used the opportunity to vent his frustration at the Centres Telangana manoeuvres that breathed fresh life into the demand for statehood for Darjeeling.        
	On New Years Eve, Chidambaram had said the Bengal situation was pretty depressing and that he had received only a brief reply from the chief minister to a long letter on a home ministry teams visit to the state over political clashes. (See chart)        
	Suspecting that the home minister was trying to placate ally Mamata Banerjee at the Left Front governments expense, Bhattacharjee today struck back, choosing the platform of the anniversary event of a CPM mouthpiece.        
	Using harsh language that belied the otherwise common wavelength between the chief minister and the home minister on tackling extremists, Bhattacharjee said: Unfortunately, our home minister commented that he had found my reply quite short. I tell you and will also tell him when we will meet that he had written too much. Thats why my reply was short.        
	Chidambaram had apparently put the responsibility on the state government to stop political clashes while being silent on the CPMs complaints that the Trinamul Congress was the cause and beneficiary of the violence.        
	The chief minister pointed out that normally, he refrained from joining issue with the home minister for the sake of Centre-state relation. But the statehood headache appeared to have prompted him to speak out.        
	You are upset with us. But the entire country is upset with you over Telangana. I would not have said these things. But our state is also suffering because of your flip-flop on Telangana, Bhattacharjee said, virtually blaming the Centre for strengthening the agitation for Gorkhaland.        
	I have asked the Prime Minister why the government took a midnight decision on Telangana and (is) now calling for consultation, Bhattacharjee added.        
	The chief minister took up Chidambarams swipe on Maoist operations, too. He said he was upset. My question is what is happening in other Maoist-hit states? Are not they suffering from Maoist terror too? Has he become upset with Bengal alone? he asked.        
	What can I do if he is upset? I am not. I know how to fight the Maoists, the gang of cowards and brigands. But police alone cant help. Political fight is also required which our comrades are doing. But what about the Trinamul Congresss collaboration with Maoists in western Bengal and other districts? the chief minister asked.        
	Bhattacharjee accused Chidambaram of appeasing Mamata. Who are you trying to placate? Are you saying these things to maintain the coalition dharma?

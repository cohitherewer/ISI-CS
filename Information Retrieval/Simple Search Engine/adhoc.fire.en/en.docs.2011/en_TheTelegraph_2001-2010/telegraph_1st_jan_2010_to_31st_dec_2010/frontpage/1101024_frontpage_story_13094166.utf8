	Oct. 23: A senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pracharak assigned to reach out to Muslims has been mentioned in the Ajmer dargah blast chargesheet as a conspirator, dismaying the BJP in the middle of the Bihar polls.        
	Indresh Kumar, a Sangh national executive member, is in charge of the outfits Rashtriya Muslim Morcha and has been involved in back- channel talks with the All India Muslim Personal Law Board for a negotiated Ayodhya settlement.        
	The 806-page chargesheet, filed yesterday, says Indresh and seven other Hindu radical leaders met secretly in Jaipur on October 31, 2005, and plotted the blasts at Ajmer Sharif, Hyderabads Mecca Masjid and Malegaon.        
	Rajasthan police sources said Indresh had not technically been named as an accused because further investigations were on to establish his role in the blast, which killed three persons at the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti on October 11, 2007.        
	The development comes at a time the Sangh has been disowning those accused in the Hindu terror blasts, many of them linked to a radical outfit called Abhinav Bharat.        
	Its a political conspiracy.... I will fight this injustice in court, Indresh said. But Sangh sources who spoke to him conceded he had not categorically denied his presence at the meeting.        
	Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhav initially said the accusation was far from the truth and would be challenged in court, but later issued a toned-down statement: We do not believe in such violent activities and will definitely cooperate with the investigators.        
	The imperative of keeping the Bihar coalition with Nitish Kumar intact prompted the BJP to distance itself from Indresh without disowning him. The BJP will react only if there is credible evidence. It is more appropriate for the RSS to react, spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said.        
	Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari alleged the Sangh had always worked to disturb communal amity and the chargesheet was a manifestation of its direction right from the beginning.        
	The chargesheet, filed by Rajasthan polices anti-terrorism squad at the court of the Ajmer additional chief judicial magistrate, says the secret meeting took place at room No. 26 of a Gujarati community guesthouse on Jaipurs M.I. Road.        
	It says Indresh was the chief speaker and urged the others to carry out their individual assignments while remaining affiliated with religious organisations to stay under the police radar.        
	The others at the meeting included several prime accused in the Mecca Masjid, Malegaon and Ajmer blasts: Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, Ramji Kalsangra, Devendra Gupta, Lokesh Sharma, Sandeep Dange and Sunil Joshi, who died recently.        
	Devendra is one of the five accused in the Ajmer chargesheet and is in judicial custody with two of the others: Lokesh Sharma and Chandra Shekhar. They are all linked with Abhinav Bharat and have been charged with murder, criminal conspiracy and defiling a place of worship. The other two accused, Dange and Kalsangra, are in hiding. Arguments on the chargesheet will be heard from Tuesday.

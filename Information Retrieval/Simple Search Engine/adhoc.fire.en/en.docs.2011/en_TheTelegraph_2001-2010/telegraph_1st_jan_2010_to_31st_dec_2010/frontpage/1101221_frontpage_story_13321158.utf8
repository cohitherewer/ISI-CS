          ANUSUA MUKHERJEE                            The artists whose works are on display at Studio21 till January 8. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Inaugurating Tarang, the exhibition of works by the Santiniketan Practicing Artists Network (Span) at Studio21 on December 17, art critic Pranab Ranjan Roy reminded young practitioners of art of their duty to themselves and society.        
	When there is chaos besieging us in the real world, the artist should try to tease out meaning from it even as he attempts to represent the collapse of meanings.        
	It is the artists responsibility to compose his work in such a way that its individual components come together to speak in a coherent language, which will bestow significance on the mess of actual life.        
	The young artists of Span do seem to be preoccupied with the struggle for meaning that Roy spoke of. The quest takes different forms but informs each of their paintings or sculptures. This is perhaps not unexpected, given the fact that these ex-students and practising artists from Santiniketans Kala Bhavan are also striving to establish their individual identities in the contemporary art world.        
	In the process of creating a language of their own, they question their selves, their relationship to the world, and inscribe in their works the uncertain answers they find. The artists search becomes the viewers as they confront the paintings.        
	Rajendra Kumar Pradhans huge untitled work is as intriguing as it is beautiful. You realise with a shock as you look at the painting that the pale figure in the left-hand corner, suspended like a sprite against the bluish darkness, is staring back at you from behind the windowpane, which is the canvas. She reminds you of Wuthering Heightss Catherine  the waif pressing her face against the window to peer into the warm, lighted room from which she is eternally excluded.        
	She might also be the Little Mermaid lost in the blue waters, amid floating hyacinth leaves, pleading with the human world to let her in.        
	If Pradhan responds to reality with a resigned sadness, Pradip Kumar Patra reacts to it with anger. His sculpture of a human torso reduced to the skeleton, with the internal organs still sticking to the bones, gestures to the loss of identity that violence brings in its wake. The grinning skull seems to mock at our wilful blindness to the brutality that has become a part of our everyday lives.        
	Sekhar Baran Karmakars painting of exposed viscera, with sinews on fire, and a scorpions tail along with an entangled snake and vulture planted inside, might seem to be built on a similar theme of violence. But Karmakar is apparently less concerned with pain than with the beauty that emerges from it.        
	He is inspired by body art, which is created out of pain. Inexplicable feelings of love and loss find expression in symbols that are part of the artists private mythology but are also there to be interpreted by viewers in their own way.        
	The best part of the works at Studio21 is perhaps their tentativeness, all the more precious because it will possibly fade away as the artists mature.        
	The artists insistent questioning of their selves, their positions and worth visx--vis the external world makes the show a celebration of youth, above all else.

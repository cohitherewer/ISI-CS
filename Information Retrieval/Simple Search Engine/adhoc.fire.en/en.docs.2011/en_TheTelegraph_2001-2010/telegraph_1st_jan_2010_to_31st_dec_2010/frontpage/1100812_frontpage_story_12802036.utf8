                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CBI takes over Koda cases
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                             Koda: No respite                                  
	Ranchi, Aug. 11: Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) today took over two cases lodged by state vigilance bureau against former chief minister Madhu Koda and five of his cabinet colleagues for owning disproportionate assets running into crores.        
	We were directed to take over the cases lodged by the vigilance bureau. So, we have re-registered the FIR earlier filed by the bureau, CBI SP R.C.Choudhary said.         
	A special AHD cell, created for probing the multi-crore fodder scam and headed by Choudhary, will investigate the Koda scam too.        
	According to CBI sources, the decision to take over the cases was taken in pursuance of the Jharkhand High Court order of August 4. The Centre was, however, yet to decide on transferring the Enforcement Directorate investigations to the CBI. The court had directed the CBI to take charge of materials collected so far by the existing investigating agencies for conducting a comprehensive, complete and thorough investigation.         
	The two cases are: vigilance police station case No. 26 filed on November 26, 2008 and case No. 9 filed on July 2, 2009.         
	The first case involved former ministers Harinarayan Rai and Anosh Ekka, while the second one involved Koda, Kamlesh Singh, Bandhu Tirkey and Bhanu Pratap Sahi. According to vigilance chargesheets, both Koda and Singh owned disproportionate assets to the tune of Rs 1.50 crore each. The chargesheet filed against Anosh Ekka said he had amassed unaccounted assets worth Rs 6.67 crore though his total earnings grossed a paltry Rs 15 lakh during the four-and-a-half-years he was minister.        
	Rai assets were estimated to be around Rs 1.63 crore.         
	Quoting a Supreme Court order in the Rubabbuddin Sheikh vs State of Gujarat case, the high court said the investigation could be handed over to the CBI even though chargesheets had been filed and a trial was on.         
	If proper investigation is carried out by well-equipped and unbiased investigating officers it will lead to precise and speedy trial. Investigation by the CBI is not a punishment, the order said.        
	According to sources, before taking over the probe, CBI director Ashwani Kumar held detailed discussions with CBI DIG S.K. Jha and SP R.C. Chaudhary on existing workload and availability of officers in Ranchi.        
	On the EDs probe, the court said that any material found by the CBI which pointed to money laundering as per the Public Money Laundering Act would be shared with the ED from time to time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamata takes it out on Delhi
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mamata takes it out on Delhi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 9: Mamata Banerjee today attacked the Centre and announced a weeklong agitation in the city from January 12, including a march a couple of kilometres from an event the Prime Minister will be attending.        
	Even some of her aides thought the programme was ill-timed, considering that Jyoti Basu was fighting for his life in hospital and Manmohan Singh was to attend the concluding session of the 150-year celebrations at St Xaviers College.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief, however, accused Delhi of surrendering to the CPM in the states ineffective battle against Maoists, and announced a weeklong programme in rebel hotbed Jangal Mahal too and a one-hour state-wide protest on January 12.        
	The railway ministers outburst came two days after Singh visited Basu at AMRI Hospital and offered the help of outside experts, which the state government eagerly grabbed. What would have annoyed Mamata is the perception  subtly fed by the CPM  of a new bonhomie between the Centre and the Left.        
	The Trinamul chief said she had no choice but to hit the streets to highlight the ineffectiveness of the joint forces operation in Jangal Mahal.        
	At a time Mamata has been trying to shed her image of traffic-stopper, Trinamul activists will agitate on all Calcutta roads and elsewhere in the state between 2pm and 3pm on January 12. They will hold a rally in Jhargram, West Midnapore, on January 15.        
	On January 16, party activists will gather at Subodh Mullick Square in central Calcutta and hold a march  possibly up to Esplanade  at 1pm, a couple of hours after Prime Minister Singhs scheduled arrival in the city.        
	A Trinamul vice-president said many in the party were unhappy with the timing and suggested the march could be deferred.         
	Mamata told reporters: The Centre has surrendered to the CPM by agreeing to launch the anti-Maoist offensive by the joint forces. But the operation has so far proved ineffective, with the Maoists on a killing spree.        
	She added: So, both Union home minister P. Chidambaram and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee owe an explanation to the innocent tribal people.        
	Mamata said she would not leave the UPA but our politeness should not be construed as weakness.

	Bangalore, Oct 18 (PTI): The Karnataka High Court will today resume hearing on a petition filed by five independent MLAs challenging their disqualification from the state Assembly.
    The court had last week ruled that the outcome of the October 14 trust vote of the B S Yeddyurappa Government would be subject to its final decision on this petition.
    The High Court, which had reserved orders on the petitions filed by 11 rebel BJP MLAs, challenging their disqualification under anti-defection law by Assembly Speaker K G Bopaiah, had refused interim relief to all the 16 MLAs, who sought a stay on their disqualification.
    The petition, filed by the five independent MLAs contending that they cannot be disqualified as they won the election as independents, was posted for hearing today.

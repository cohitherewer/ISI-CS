The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ire spills in new budget term
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Ire spills in new budget term
          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, March 4: Opposition ire over the ongoing process of identifying below poverty line (BPL) families in the state rocked the Assembly on the first day of the budget session today.        
	Terming the exercise a farce and a mere eyewash, the Opposition pushed the treasury bench on the back foot over the issues of BPL survey, the governments irresponsible attitude towards the Annamalai University deaths and pending irrigation projects.         
	The deadline to issue a fresh BPL list expired on February 28. However, the state missed the deadline miserably with many districts accusing the government of changing the BPL inclusion/exclusion criteria at least thrice, leaving officials confused.         
	The issue came up during a supplementary question put by leader of the Opposition Rajendra Prasad Singh, who alleged that many eligible families did not figure on the BPL list.         
	This prompted Speaker C.P. Singh to comment that it was a matter of great concern and the state government should take up the issue in a transparent and serious way.         
	From the treasury benches, deputy chief minister Rabhubar Das conceded that there were many anomalies in the last BPL list and the new exercise was initiated to rectify the same. The government needs some time to complete the survey and for that it expects cooperation from all, said Das.         
	As the state receives a fixed quota of foodgrain from the Centre for distribution among 23.94 lakh BPL families, Das promised the House that a delegation led by chief minister Shibu Soren would soon meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and apprise him about the increased demand of foodgrain after the new BPL families are given ration cards.         
	Apprehending an unprecedented swell in the number of BPL families at the end of the ongoing survey, the government directed all deputy commissioners to ensure that the number did not cross 10 per cent of the population, an unrealistic demand given the varying socio-economic condition of different districts.         
	Moreover, over five lakh BPL families still do not have ration cards and are denied benefits due to scarcity of foodgrain.         
	The only options in front of the state are either to reduce the quota of 35kg foodgrain every month to each BPL family or request the Centre to allocate more foodgrain.                                             
	There was furore over the deaths of two Annamalai University students from Jharkhand after the issue was raised by CPI(ML) legislator Vinod Kumar Singh during Zero Hour.         
	The government should ensure that such incidents are not repeated, said Singh.         
	JVM(P) legislator Pradeep Yadav said the government should have sent a high-level team to Tamil Nadu to present the states point if view.         
	HRD minister Hemlal Murmu replied that the chief secretary had spoken to his Tamil Nadu counterpart over phone.         
	However, Murmus reply was countered by Congress MLA from Jamshedpur (West), Banna Gupta, who said not a single government official was present at Jamshedpur when the body of one of the students arrived in the steel city.         
	This again prompted Murmu to promise the House that the government would issue a statement on the entire episode on March 10.         
	The issue of pending water resources projects in Palamau was the centre of discussion during the first hour. The government was pushed to a corner when water resources minister Chandra Prakash Choudhary failed to answer how long it would take to complete pending projects.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Very hard without act: Army chief
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Very hard without act: Army chief
          SUJAN DUTTA                                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: The military has said it is reluctant to operate in Jammu and Kashmir  or any insurgency area without the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) that practically grants immunity to its soldiers from being prosecuted in courts.        
	The reluctance has been expressed despite mounting pressure from Kashmir and the government in Delhi.        
	We have made our position very clear. We have operated in some places without the act. It is very, very difficult. Without that (the act), we could be dragged into court for no rhyme or reason. But it is a matter on which the political leadership will have to decide, army chief General V.K. Singh told The Telegraph here today.        
	Within the government, there is a strong move  from the Prime Ministers Office and the home ministry  to repeal the AFSPA in about six districts of Kashmir to signal a political giveaway to buy peace.        
	But the street fighting and protests in Kashmir  where the toll in the clashes since June has touched 88  appear to have gone beyond the demand to repeal the act. A grim-faced defence minister, A.K. Antony, today described it as very sensitive.        
	The protests in Kashmir are also feeding into the concerns of the army because of the possibility that while its powers could be curtailed, it may be saddled with greater peace enforcement responsibilities. It is already heavily deployed along the Line of Control and the unrest threatens its rear area security.        
	By speaking out against efforts to dilute the AFSPA, army chief Gen. Singh was merely echoing what his predecessors and even the chairman of the chiefs of staff committee, Air Chief Marshal Pradeep Vasant Naik, have said.        
	But the fact that the military is resolute in its stand despite the political inclination to present a giveaway to buy peace in Kashmir shows just how seriously it takes the act.        
	Air Chief Marshal Naik, too, said here today that when the military is on duty, it deserves all the protection it can get. I am sure the government is aware of this and will decide accordingly.        
	Defence minister Antony said the cabinet committee on security (CCS) had toiled over proposals on Kashmir on Monday. It was a very long meeting, over three hours. Important decisions are to be taken. When that is the case, we have to take political parties in for consultation. Tomorrow, there is the all-party meeting. Then we will decide (on whether to repeal the AFSPA from some districts in Kashmir). The decision will not be delayed, he said.        
	The army chief is understood to have briefed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last week. Ahead of tomorrows all-party meeting, the BJP has also spoken out against efforts to repeal the AFSPA.        
	Despite protests against the act, the army has thwarted efforts to undo it. Asked if it is conceivable for the army to act without the cover of the AFSPA, a top army officer said: It is theoretically possible but doing that in the Valley is a different matter altogether; we cannot operate without the AFSPA in Kashmir.        
	The details of the areas are not available but one officer said the army was deployed in areas where the AFSPA is not in force.         
	In all likelihood, this is all or part of Mizoram where New Delhi has recorded probably its most successful mainstreaming of insurgents since the Mizo National Front came overground and participated in government formation in the 1980s.        
	Important decisions can be taken after involving everyone, said the defence minister. The situation in Kashmir is very sensitive, he said.

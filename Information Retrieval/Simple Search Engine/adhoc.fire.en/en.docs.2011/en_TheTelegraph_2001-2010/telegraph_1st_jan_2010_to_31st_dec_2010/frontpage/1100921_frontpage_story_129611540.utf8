	New Delhi, Sep 21 (PTI): Commonwealth Games Federation President Michael Fennell today asked the Indian government to take immediate steps to fix the condition of Games Village's residential zone, which according to him, has "shocked" many contingents.
    With just 12 days to go for the sporting extravaganza, the CGF chief has expressed doubts over the state of what he called a "seriously compromised" Games Village.
    In a statement, Fennell said he had written to the Cabinet Secretary K M Chandrashekar and requested him to take urgent steps before the first batch of athletes arrive on Thursday.
    "The final preparations for the Commonwealth Games Village have been of concern to the CGF since viewing the residential zone along with a number of Commonwealth Games Associations (CGAs) advance parties on September 15," the CGF President said.

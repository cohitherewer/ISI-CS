	Calcutta, March 5: Sandipan Das, the IT professional kidnapped by a taxi driver and two accomplices last weekend, has described to The Telegraph how his abductors comical ineptness with his touchscreen smartphone provided vital clues to police.        
	The trio made all the ransom calls with my touchscreen phone, which none of them knew how to operate properly. They would fail to disconnect after ending the conversation, Das said.         
	As the gang took out the battery and even the SIM card in desperation, my family members and the police would get to hear (their) confused chatter. This gave the police extra seconds to trace the calls.

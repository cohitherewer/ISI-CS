	Patna, July 28: Rabri Devi, the cheekiest succession act in Indias political annals, is history.         
	Her husband and party boss, Lalu Prasad, is loath to formally announce the quiet casualty at home, but word is out from his camp of the expiry of her public innings.         
	The RJD will not project her as chief minister in the forthcoming elections; should some quirk of fate return the RJD to power later this year, Lalu Prasad will himself assume the reins of the state.         
	Should it be rejected a second successive time, survival will dictate the choice of a more hands-on leader of Opposition.         
	The coming election is already a desperate battle for us, a top Lalu Prasad aide told The Telegraph. If we lose, drastic changes will have to be made if we are to remain relevant. Laluji is aware of this more than anyone.        
	Rabri Devi may yet contest an Assembly seat, but that will only be because it will assure the RJD of one more to its tally. In effect, the former Bihar chief minister and current leader of Opposition is already back where she was plucked out from 13 years ago and still feels most comfortable: at home.        
	She has not been seen leading her flock in the Assembly for a while now, not even during last weeks riotous eruption over alleged corruption in the Nitish Kumar government. And in the five years that she has helmed the Opposition, she hasnt made a single presentation of note or political weight in or outside the Assembly. She has seldom been effective, she has often been an embarrassment. Notable among her public gaffes was a scurrilous accusation of an illicit relationship between chief minister Nitish Kumar and the sister of estranged former JD(U) state chief, Lallan Singh, during the last Lok Sabha campaign. Lalu Prasad had to promptly and publicly apologise for Rabri Devis transgression, and a civil suit still appends the affair.         
	Of late, she has also taken to staying in Delhi for long stretches; Lalu Prasad is more often in Bihar and more frequently in occupation of the official residence of the leader of Opposition than Rabri Devi herself.         
	Those familiar with the Lalu-Rabri household suggest that Rabri Devis unannounced but noticeable retreat from the public eye has happened at Lalu Prasads considered bidding. As one of them put it: She was the necessity of a certain hour of crisis when Laluji had to step down from power, those circumstances no longer exist.         
	What he, and others around Lalu Prasad, leave unsaid probably out of deference to their leader is that Rabri Devi never made good her pitchforking into politics, abrupt and unwilling though it was.         
	On the contrary, she is increasingly seen in the RJD as a liability. Basically she is just blocking a key position in the party, said a senior partyman. The irony is the poor lady does not even wish to be there, she never has.        
	Rabri Devi is probably the only chief minister who went to Raj Bhavan wailing she wouldnt take oath. Chargesheeted in the fodder scam, Lalu Prasad was forced to quit as chief minister in the July of 1997. Unprepared to give up his hold on power and suddenly insecure, he conjured a move of stunning chutzpah and audacity to surmount the crisis  he dove into his bedroom and forced the mantle on his virtually unlettered wife, already sobbing at the prospect of her husband being thrown into jail.        
	In the melodramatic chain of events that followed and have now become part of Bihars political lore, Rabri Devi was hauled to Raj Bhavan and lumped with the chief ministers job. The hustle that rainy July evening in the shaken corridors of power was such that it didnt even strike Rabri Devi she had landed at her swearing-in in rubber bathroom slippers.        
	But in the eight years that she ruled the state thereafter, Rabri Devi betrayed no taste for politics, even less for governance. She seldom attended office and didnt care to equip herself with the wherewithal of taking the most rudimentary meetings; her conduct in the Assembly often left the treasury mortified and the Opposition in guffaws. When she hit the public stage, her discomfort and reluctance were so evident it often exasperated Lalu Prasad.         
	During the Assembly elections of 2000, he would often have to force her hand to wave out to crowds from the window of their departing chopper. For all that effort, Rabri Devi remained, at her best, a notable and obedient rubber-stamp for Lalu Prasad who continued to wield power by proxy.         
	His wifes political surrogacy is not a tactic Lalu Prasad needs to employ any more to make claims on power, but the person most delighted at the lapse of her usefulness is probably Rabri Devi herself.

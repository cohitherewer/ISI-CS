	Bokaro, Nov. 7: After a lull of over three years, Maoists made their presence felt at Jhumra hillocks, once regarded as a safe training ground for rebels, by triggering an explosion that claimed a CRPF jawan today.         
	The incident occurred at Jamunijara, about 140km from Bokaro steel city, in the Mahutaand area around 2.30pm.        
	D.B. Basumatari, 34, the head constable of CRPFs 26th battalion, had pulled off a Maoist banner without taking necessary precautions.         
	According to top police sources, Basumatari, a resident of Assam who had been serving the paramilitary force for more than 15 years, had gone on a long-range patrol at the Jhumra zone along with two dozens personnel.         
	The team had reached midway between Rahawan (the CRPF base camp) and Jhumra when they spotted a flag and a banner in support of Naxalites by a roadside bush.         
	Basumatari decided to inspect the flag and the banner and ordered his colleagues to stay behind and take guard.         
	He went ahead and pulled out the banner without realising that a powerful bomb was planted underneath.         
	A huge explosion followed and the jawan was tossed in the air. He died on the spot while the other personnel escaped unhurt as they were a good distance away from the explosion site.        
	Immediately, the entire area was cordoned off and a search operation conducted but to no avail.        
	Inspector-general (operations) Raj Kumar Mallick said the head constable paid with his life for ignoring the security rules.         
	On June 30, 2007, more than 300 armed Maoists, including guerrillas from Andhra Pradesh and Nepal, had attacked the CRPF camp at Jhumra from three sides with an aim to take it from the security forces.         
	But the rebels received a huge setback as eight guerrillas were killed in the gunbattle that continued for more than three hours. The CRPF personnel forced the intruders to retreat. Since then, the Maoists had not struck Jhumra till today.

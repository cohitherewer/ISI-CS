  - I will starve there, better to die here than go back home          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: Yasmin, the Bengal girl rescued here on Thursday, today said she preferred her new life to the poverty and hunger that awaited her back home, shining a light on causes that underpin trafficking and the challenges ahead of rehabilitation agencies.        
	Yasmin (name changed), 16, also confirmed that her relative Kashmira Bibi had handed her over to traffickers.        
	Ghar jaane se achchha hai yahan pe mar jana (better to die here than return home), the girl, kidnapped from Kakdwip in April last year, told The Telegraph in fluent Hindi.        
	Yasmin said she had grown used to the comforts of her life in Delhis party circuit, learnt Hindi and forgotten to speak Bengali in these 20 months, and now called the couple who had bought her Papa and Mummy.        
	In her village of Balikhali in South 24-Parganas, hunger stares one in the face, she said. I will die of starvation there. Ive got used to a life of comfort after sacrificing a lot; theres no point going back.        
	She is also afraid of stigma: People will laugh at me and make up stories about me. Now I hate my village and its people.        
	Yasmin will, however, have to board the Rajdhani Express tomorrow with Bengal CID officers and will be reaching Calcutta on Monday morning to be presented before the high court. She spoke to this newspaper at Banga Bhavan shortly after counselling by the Delhi governments child welfare committee (CWC), which cleared her journey to Bengal.        
	CWC chairperson Neera Mallick said a traumatised Yasmin needed counselling and a lot of care and affection for six months before she could be rehabilitated.         
	It now depends on the Bengal government how they provide counselling and other facilities to help her return to normal life. If they fail to do so, the girl could return to the world her tormentors had thrown her into.                    
	Yasmin said her sister-in-laws sibling Kashmira had handed her over to a man called Kalam, who brought her to Delhi, sexually abused her in a hotel and sold her to Azhar.        
	She was finally sold to a couple whom she addressed as Papa and Mummy. The husband, Pappu, groomed her in manners and etiquette, showered her with gifts and gave her a new name: Julie.        
	There were five other girls. A woman gave us Hindi lessons. We were given expensive clothes and good food. I loved my air-conditioned room; I drank only mineral water. I would go to a lot of parties and have been to big hotels too. After a few months, I accepted the new life like the other girls, she said.        
	They (Pappu and his wife) have given me a lot and I want to go back to them.        
	Pappu went into hiding after Thursdays police raid netted Azhar and rescued Yasmin.        
	Yasmin said she had recently met a man from Moradabad, who had promised to marry her after two years. He owns a mutton shop. I want a happy life, not a life like the girls at my village have.        
	She said her father Khater Bhisti, a 61-year-old fish seller, was a harsh man and had pulled her out of school after Class III, fearing she might run away with somebody. I wanted to continue studying....        
	Did she miss her village? I have a very close friend, Mohitan, there... but she would have been married off by now.        
	One day last year, after her father had behaved particularly badly with her, Kashmira had promised to find her a job outside Bengal.        
	She told me my father and stepmother hated me, said Yasmin, who has been rescued thanks to her illiterate stepmothers unyielding crusade against police apathy.        
	On April 15, 2009, Yasmin was returning home after watching a circus when Kashmira introduced her to Kalam, who was waiting on a motorcycle, and asked her to go with him, Yasmin said. I didnt know he would sell me off.        
	Kalam, a 32-year-old Calcuttan, rode straight to Howrah station and boarded a train with her, saying he would find her a job. In Delhi, he took her to a hotel, spiked her soft drinks and assaulted her, Yasmin said. I wept a lot that day.        
	The next day, she was sold off to Azhar. They (Azhar and his associates) tortured me. When I wanted to go back to my village, they threatened to kill me.        
	Kalam, arrested in November on trafficking charges, had helped the police arrest Azhar here on Thursday. Both reached Calcutta today with a CID team. Azhar will be produced in Kakdwip court tomorrow.         
	Azhar, who wore Versace woollens and Nike sneakers, has allegedly told the police he had contacts across Bengal who would traffic girls to him.

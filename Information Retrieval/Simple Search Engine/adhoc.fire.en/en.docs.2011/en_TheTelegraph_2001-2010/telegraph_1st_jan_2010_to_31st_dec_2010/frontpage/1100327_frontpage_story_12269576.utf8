                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Modi ready, cops clueless
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Modi                                
	Ahmedabad, March 26: Narendra Modi is ready to appear tomorrow before the Supreme Court-monitored Special Investigation Team on the Gujarat riots, his lawyers said today.         
	He is ready to appear tomorrow. Thats all I can say, said Mahesh Jethmalani, a senior advocate who is among the battery of legal eagles advising Modi.         
	Jethmalani declined to confirm or deny whether that meant Modi would appear before the SIT. It is all up to him, he said.        
	Modi has been called by the SIT in connection with the Gulbarg housing society massacre of February 28, 2002, in which Congress leader Ahsan Jafri was killed along with 68 others. Modis name figures as the first accused in a complaint filed by Zakia Jafri, the widow of the slain leader, in the Supreme Court, which has asked the SIT to look into it.         
	SIT chief R.K. Raghavan, a former CBI director, added to the suspense by saying he has no idea if Modi would show up. Your guess is as good as mine, Raghavan told The Telegraph.        
	Modi had written a letter to Raghavan earlier this week seeking a clarification on whether he should wait until the Supreme Court hears a petition asking it to recall its order referring Zakias complaint to the SIT.         
	Jethmalani had then said Modi would like a clarification but was willing to appear on March 27 or any other mutually acceptable date if the SIT still wished to go ahead and question the chief minister.         
	Raghavan refused to comment on the letter sent by Modi.        
	An official at the chief ministers office pointed out that the SIT had not asked Modi to appear tomorrow. The chief minister has sought a clarification from the SIT and we have not got any communication in this regard, the official said.         
	SIT sources had told The Telegraph that Modi had put forth three conditions before the panel and had agreed to appear only after the terms were accepted.         
	The three conditions were: the proceedings should be held in camera; the SIT should conduct the proceedings at an undisclosed location; and finally, Modis lawyer has to be present at the proceedings.         
	The sources said the SIT had agreed to all three conditions.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Itanagar, Aug. 6: A cabin crew member of a Pawan Hans helicopter fell to his death from 10,000 feet after being sucked out while trying to shut the unfastened chopper door that had flung open mid air.        
	The mangled body of 37-year-old Dhananjoy Roy, who hailed from Hansimara in Jalpaiguri district of North Bengal, was recovered by police from a paddy field at Namsai in Arunachal Pradesh, 495km from Itanagar.        
	The door of the 24-seater MI-72, which was flying from Namsai to Tezu in Lohit district, had not been fastened properly during take-off.        
	The chopper that began its journey from Naharlagun was to reach Anjao via Namsai and Tezu. The directorate-general of civil aviation has ordered an inquiry into the accident.         
	The shocking incident occurred just five minutes after MI-72, that was scheduled to arrive in Tezu via Namsai, took off around 11.10 this morning. Soon after it was in mid-air, presumably at an elevation of nearly 3,000 metres (approximately 9,900 feet), Dhananjoy, one of the five cabin crew members, discovered the door was not fastened properly and advanced to shut it. When he tried to close the door, it suddenly flung open in a gust of wind and he fell to his death. The pilot of the chopper returned to Namsai and informed us. A police team rushed to the spot, between Lathaw and Sensat, about 8km from Namsai, the subdivisional police offer of Namsai, Subhitya Gohain, said.         
	Half of Roys body was trapped at least two feet beneath the muddy paddy field.         
	An unnatural death case under CrPC 174 has been registered with Namsai police station.         
	Suryanarayan Rao, a technician and crew member who was on board, said Roy, who was seated next to him, advanced towards the door when he found it unlatched.        
	He had repaired the snag and also called Rao for assistance but lost balance in the wind that rocked the chopper and fell to his death.        
	Nine persons, including five cabin crew members and four passengers, were on board at the time.        
	If we find any negligence on the authorities part, we shall lodge a case under IPC. An investigation is on, Gohain added.        
	An official of Pawan Hans refused to give details of the cause of the accident, saying the matter was sensitive.        
	The chopper remained at Namsai and suspended its journey for the day.

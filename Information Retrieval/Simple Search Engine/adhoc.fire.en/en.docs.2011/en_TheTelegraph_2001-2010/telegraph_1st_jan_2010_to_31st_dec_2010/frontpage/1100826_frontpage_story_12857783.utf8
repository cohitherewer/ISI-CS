The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Elin breaks silence of hell
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Elin breaks silence of hell
  - Didnt hit but not a minute of golf after betrayal: Ex-wife                                 Elin on the cover of People                                  
	Aug. 25: Hell.        
	Elin Nordegren has answered the most uncomfortable but compelling question tantalising the world ever since a torrid sex scandal engulfed her marriage with Tiger Woods.         
	Ive been through hell, the Swedish-born former nanny told People magazine, breaking her silence on one of the biggest scandal to buffet sports.        
	Its hard to think you have this life, and then all of a sudden  was it a lie? Youre struggling because it wasnt real. But I survived, it was hard, but it didnt kill me, Elin, 30, said in an interview published two days after she and Woods issued a statement confirming their divorce.        
	Elin sought to set another enduring mystery to rest, insisting that she never hit him. She has also not watched one minute of golf since the revelations.        
	In November outside their Florida home, Woods drove his SUV over a fire hydrant and into a tree, setting off shocking revelations that sports biggest star had been cheating on his wife through multiple affairs.         
	There was never any violence inside or outside our home, she said. The speculation that I would have used a golf club to hit him is just truly ridiculous.                              
	Elin said Woods left the house that night and when he didnt return after a while, she got worried and went to look for him. She said thats when she found him in the car.        
	I did everything I could to get him out of the locked car, she said. To think anything else is absolutely wrong.        
	She and Woods tried for months and months to reconcile, Elin added, but without trust and love it wasnt possible. She will relocate to southern Florida so that her children can be close to their father.        
	Elin suggested that she would eventually forgive Woods, but that she is still working on it. Forgiveness takes time, she said. It is the last step of the grieving process.        
	People said the interview was conducted over four visits lasting a total of 19 hours at the rented Windermere, Florida, home where she now lives with their two children.        
	The magazine said Elin had approached the publication to tell her side of the story and a spokesperson said no one had been paid for the article. I felt like setting some things straight, Elin said in the article.        
	Elin, who met Woods at the age of 21 while minding children for a Swedish golfer but is now studying psychology, said she never suspected the affairs that Woods admitted to and publicly apologised for in February.        
	Im so embarrassed that I never suspected  not a one. For the last three and a half years, when all this was going on, I was home a lot more with pregnancies, then the children and my school, she said.        
	When she found out, the word betrayal isnt strong enough. I felt like my whole world had fallen apart.         
	It seemed that my world as I thought it was had never existed. I felt embarrassed for having been so deceived. I felt betrayed by many people around me.        
	Woods, who has won 14 major championships, returned to the game in April after losing up to $35 million in sponsorship revenue as his private life unravelled over allegations that surfaced in late November and December about affairs between him and several women.        
	Since then, Elin said, she has experienced various emotions. Woods and Elin share custody of a three-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son.        
	She added: I have been through the stages of disbelief and shock, to anger and ultimately grief over the loss of the family I so badly wanted for my children.        
	Of the settlement she received, which neither she nor Woods have disclosed but People estimated to be worth $100 million, she said it wasnt worth splitting up her family.        
	Money cant buy me happiness, she said. Or put my family back together.        
	Praised for maintaining her privacy through the ordeal, Elin, who disclosed she suffered weight and hair loss from stress before the divorce, said she wanted to protect her children.        
	For my kids, I felt that (maintaining privacy) was the only normalcy I could give them, since they have a very famous dad, she said.        
	 While Elin said she has watched little TV in the last nine months, she sometimes followed the scandal on the Internet. Friends also kept her informed.        
	She credited therapy for helping her deal with her emotions and kept a journal. I havent gone back to read what I wrote in December and January; Im afraid to, she said.                    WRITTEN WITH AP AND REUTERS REPORTS

          KUMUD JENAMANI                             Drivers and contractors of the city bus service protest at Baridih depot in Jamshedpur on Thursday. (Bhola Prasad)                                  
	Jamshedpur, Oct. 7: Barely a month after its launch, city bus services stalled in the steel city today as belligerent drivers, conductors and cleaners stayed away from work, claiming life threats from private operators.        
	While private operators alleged the city buses were being run on routes that werent allotted to them, Jharkhand State Tourism Development Corporation that is in charge of the service was defensive, trying to downplay the controversy by resorting to a feeble explanation.        
	The 24 city buses that started plying on eight routes from September 1 remained parked at the Baridih depot as the staff struck work, alleging regular harassment, including physical assault, by rival minibus operators.         
	One of the striking drivers, Narayan Singh, alleged that owners owing allegiance to the Jamshedpur Minibus Owners Association (JMOA) had attacked him and his helpers at Govindpur over the last three days.         
	He said the rival operators had threatened to kill him if he tried to pick up passengers from Govindpur or Sakchi on the Govindpur-Sakchi route, which incidentally is not an approved route for the city bus service.         
	As several other drivers are facing similar problems, we decided not to venture out unless the administration provided us security, said Singh.         
	Ignoring allegations that he was not supposed to be plying on the route in the first place, Singh added that bus stands needed to be put up at strategic points on every route to allow the city buses to pick up passengers. He also demanded identity cards for the staff.         
	The striking drivers and conductors said they would not resume work unless Ranchi Security Services, the outsourced agency operating the buses in Jamshedpur, provided them necessary security and infrastructure.         
	According to sources, some minibus operators intercepted a JNNURM bus at Govindpur on Monday and assaulted the driver and conductor for plying on the route illegally. The same people manhandled the staff of the JNNURM buses on Tuesday and yesterday as well.                                             
	JMOA office-bearers, when contacted, said the problem had arisen because the city bus staff were deviating from routes specified by the state transport commissioner.         
	JMOA president Chandra Mohan Prasad said: The Govindpur-Sakchi route is not among the eight routes allotted for the city buses, but they continue to operate buses on that route, triggering unnecessary tension.         
	JTDC manager (administration) Alok Prasad admitted the city buses did not have permission to ply on the route. But, local JTDC official Rakesh Kumar, tried to defend the city bus staff.        
	 The JMOA plea that the city buses are violating route norms is wrong. When the bus service was launched, we had been allotted eight routes. Later we started the service on new routes including Govindpur-Sakchi as the service had become popular among commuters.         
	The eight approved routes for the JNNURM buses in Jamshedpur are  NIT Junction to Mercy Hospital, Transport Colony to Mercy Hospital, MGM-railway station, Sakchi court-Ram Mandir, Pardih-Sundernagar, Aashiana-Baridih, Kandra-railway station and Mango-Birsanagar.

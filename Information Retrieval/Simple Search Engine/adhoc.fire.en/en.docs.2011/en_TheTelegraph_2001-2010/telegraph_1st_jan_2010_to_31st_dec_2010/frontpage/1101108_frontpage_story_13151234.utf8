                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Pleasant surprise: ambience   amp; camels
  - Food to music, all-Indian dinner          RUDRANGSHU MUKHERJEE                                                           
	New Delhi, Nov. 7: It was a rare privilege to shake Barack Obamas hand at a dinner hosted for him by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at his residence, 7 Race Course Road. The privilege was not diluted by the fact that it had to be shared with 70 other people drawn from different walks of life.        
	The guest list included Sonia and Rahul Gandhi and select cabinet ministers like Pranab Mukherjee, P. Chidambaram and Kapil Sibal. Former Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and former national security adviser Brajesh Mishra were present.        
	From the world of cinema there were Shabana Azmi, Javed Akhtar and Aamir Khan. Ratan Tata, Narayana Murthy and Azim Premji represented business. Some of Indias top bureaucrats were visible.        
	If there was nothing unpredictable in the guest list, the ambience, according to some veterans of such august occasions, was somewhat unique. The dinner was held on the lawn but not quite under a shamiana.         
	Small canopies had been set up and under these were placed round tables to seat six. Only the high table, under a slightly bigger canopy, was a little bigger and there sat the US President and the First Lady, the Prime Minister and his wife, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi and Pranab Mukherjee.        
	On two sides of the canopies were camels in full ceremonial regalia belonging to the Border Security Force Camel Band. Members of the band played some ragas on bugles and horns to the accompaniment of drums. The camels looked spectacular. The music was provided by the Indian Navy Band.         
	The food, like the music, was Indian. The non-vegetarian menu began with shorba shahbano; and was followed by jhinga dum nisha, mahi dum anari, ran-e dumpukht, subz miloni, chukki gobhi badami, dal dumpukht, murgh yakhni pulao and assorted Indian breads. The sweets were raspberry ganache tart, kesari phirni and mawa potli. In the vegetarian section, the non-veg items were replaced with qasr-e pukhtan, dum ki guchhi and motia pulao.        
	The food had been prepared under the supervision of chefs Bhasin and Quereshi from ITC Maurya. The fare was tasty and wholesome but the master touch of Imtiaz, ITCs star chef, was missing, alas.         
	At the end of it all, after Obama and his entourage had left, in a characteristic gesture, the Prime Minister went round chatting to the guests but what was most touching  but this is also typical of him  was to see Manmohan Singh going up to thank the musicians.        
	As I was taking my leave, my old and good friend, Salman Khursheed, minister-in-waiting for Obama, asked me what it felt like being a part of history after having studied and taught history.         
	History may have been made in the discussions that preceded the dinner. They were scheduled to last 25 minutes but went on for double the time.        
	But none of the guests, including Sonia Gandhi, really minded the wait. The making of history is obviously time-consuming. But the dinner that followed was enjoyable. Thank you, Prime Minister and Mr Obama.

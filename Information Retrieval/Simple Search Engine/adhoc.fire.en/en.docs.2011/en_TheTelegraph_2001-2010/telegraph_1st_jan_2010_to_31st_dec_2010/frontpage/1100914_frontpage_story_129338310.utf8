	Mumbai, Sep 14 (PTI): Just two days after slamming Salman Khan's remarks on 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks as anti-national, Shiv Sena today said there was no reason to harbour anger against the actor as his family is patriotic in the true sense.
    "There is no reason for us to harbour anger against Salman. His family is nationalist and patriotic in true sense," Sena chief Bal Thackeray said in an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana'.
    "Salman apologised after the furore in the country (over his remarks). He must have realised that the furore was not by the rich but by the common masses," Thackeray said, in an apparent jibe at Salman's remarks about 'hype' over the terror attacks because the rich were targeted.
    It is good that Salman was not adamant like Shah Rukh Khan, the editorial said.

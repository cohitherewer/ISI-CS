The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mount of dirt from record Satyam hunt
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mount of dirt from record Satyam hunt
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                      Ramalinga Raju                          
	Hyderabad, Sept. 29: Mahindra Satyam today crawled out of a 21-month black hole  and unveiled a status report on in its true financial health after an army of forensic auditors pored over 2 million transactions dating back to 2002 to understand the ramifications of the countrys worst corporate fraud.        
	The accounting restatement completed in a little over 500 days and touted as one of the fastest ever, beating similar exercises at Enron and other scam-scarred companies in the US  left market analysts and investors astounded by the sheer audacity with which Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju and his cohorts had perpetrated the Rs 7,800-crore fraud.         
	The fraud was perpetrated over 8, 10 or 12 years  take your pick, Mahindra Satyam chairman Vineet Nayyar told reporters soon after the board of directors adopted the restated accounts. We hit a wall in 2002; we couldnt access the figures beyond that date.         
	We had to go trawl 279,000 files, 2 million emails, scrutinise over 200 bank accounts and over 7,000 contracts, Nayyar said to highlight the magnitude of the task.        
	The audit revealed all the shenanigans of the fallen software czar: fictitious transactions, tax fiddles, fake employees and salary payments, overstated accounts, fudged bank balances, dodgy debts, and a dollar diddle.        
	What emerged from the mangled wreck didnt look pretty: Satyam, which once ranked as Indias fourth largest software exporter, is now a loss-making company. It reported a net loss of Rs 123.9 crore for the year ended March 31, 2010, on a revenue of Rs 5481 crore.         
	However, the Mahindra Satyam management drew some comfort from the fact that it was able to pare its losses from the level of Rs 8,176.8 crore in the year ended March 2009. It reported revenues of Rs 8,812.6 crore in the 2008-09. The dip in the revenues in the latest year was attributed to the downsizing of the company.        
	After the restatement of two years of accounts, the company will come out with the results for the first two quarters of 2010-11 by the middle of November. Once that exercise is completed, the company will mull a merger with group company Tech Mahindra.         
	It will be at least a year before we can start looking at a full recovery. Satyam was a patient that was in intensive care for close to six months till mid-May 2009 when we took over; right now, it is still convalescing, Nayyar said.        
	I had promised the associates in the company that we would turn it around in three years. In the first one and a half years, we have cleared the fog and also earned the confidence of both the associates and the clients. In the next one and a half years, we will become profitable, he said.        
	Mahindra Satyam has a head count of 27,000 today, down from 44,000 in early 2009. The company, which had more than 500 active clients at one time, now has around 350. But we have managed to win back business from several Fortune 500 companies and also added 44 new clients in the last few months, Nayyar added.         
	The company said its forensic audit revealed that there had been fictitious transactions during the entire period from April 1, 2002, to September 30, 2008.         
	Nayyar said the audit had shown that there was a dodgy opening cash balance of Rs 1,122 crore in 2002  but hadnt been able to trace it further as it then used a different accounting software.        
	The company found that 37 companies linked to Raju had been clamouring for repayments worth Rs 1,230.4 crore but there was no record of these temporary advances. Mahindra Satyam has received legal notices from these firms and plans to contest them.        
	Officials also said a sum of $ 41 million appeared to have been diverted out of the proceeds from Satyams American Depositary Receipts (ADR) flotation in May 2001.

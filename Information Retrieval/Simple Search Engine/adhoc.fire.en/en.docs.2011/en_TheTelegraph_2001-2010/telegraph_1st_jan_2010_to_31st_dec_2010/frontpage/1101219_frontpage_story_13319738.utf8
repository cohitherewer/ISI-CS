	Yeonpyeong (South Korea,) Dec. 18 (Reuters): Bad weather today appeared likely to delay a live-fire drill by South Korean marines that drew North Korean threats of another military attack and renewed calls for restraint by China.        
	The South Korean military had planned the exercise for December 18-21 off the small island of Yeonpyeong, hit by a North Korean bombardment last month.        
	However, military officials quoted by Yonhap news agency said the drills were likely to be delayed by fog and wind.        
	Analysts were sceptical the North would carry out the threat it issued yesterday, which rattled financial markets and brought a vow by the South to retaliate against any attack by Pyongyang.        
	But tensions on the peninsula remained high, with a US troubleshooter, Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico, calling the situation a tinderbox and urging the North to let the rival South conduct exercises.        
	China, the Norths main backer, urged both nations to refrain from acts that would inflame an already extremely precarious situation.        
	The serious tension on the peninsula must not be allowed to escalate, Chinese vice-foreign minister Zhang Zhijun said today. China is firmly against any behaviour that may result in the situation deteriorating or damaging regional stability.        
	Yeonpyeong is a usually sleepy place. But the island is also only a short distance from the Northern Line Limit (NLL)  the sea border declared at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War but still disputed by the North.        
	Many of the 1,600 residents, who live alongside 1,000 military personnel, are uneasy about the prospect of a new barrage and have chosen to leave for the mainland for a while.        
	A marine corps officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the military would only announce plans for the drills a few hours in advance, and only to media on the island.        
	North Korea said yesterday it would retaliate against the drills with a stronger strike than last months bombardment, in which it rained 170 rounds of artillery down on Yeonpyeong, killing four people. South Korea hit back with 80 rounds.        
	Today, the Norths state media launched a blistering assault on the Souths pledge to cooperate with the US and retaliate in the event of another bombardment. They suggested any such move could trigger a nuclear conflict.        
	It is a suicidal move akin to digging ones own grave for the Souths conservative forces to gang up with outside elements to try to harm compatriots, the official publication of the Norths cabinet, Minju Joson, said in an editorial.        
	The Norths foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by the official KCNA news agency: We will be sure to settle scores with the US for the extreme situation on the Korean peninsula. He added: Our military does not speak empty words.        
	Zhang said Beijing recently summoned the ambassadors of both Koreas to remind them of Chinas position and proposals.        
	Russia called on South Korea to halt plans for the drill, summoning the ambassadors from Seoul and Washington to express extreme concern over the exercise.        
	In Pyongyang, Governor Richardson, on a private mission to cool tensions, told CNN in a telephone interview: Theres enormous potential for miscalculation.        
	He added: Im urging (on the North) extreme restraint ... Lets cool things down. The US state department underscored the US stance that South Korea had every right to conduct the exercises.

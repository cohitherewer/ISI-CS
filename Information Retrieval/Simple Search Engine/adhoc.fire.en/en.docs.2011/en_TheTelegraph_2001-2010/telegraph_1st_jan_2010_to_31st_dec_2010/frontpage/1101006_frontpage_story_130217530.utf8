	New Delhi, Oct 6 (PTI): The Supreme Court today commuted the death sentence of accused Santosh Kumar Singh in the sensational 14-year-old Priyadarshini Mattoo rape and murder case, sparking strong reaction from the family and friends of the victim.
    The apex court bench comprising Justices H S Bedi and C K Prasad upheld the conviction of Singh, then a law college student, for killing and raping Mattoo, his junior, but reduced the death sentence to life imprisonment, saying certain things were in his favour.
    "The conviction is maintained," the Bench said adding however, "To our mind, certain things are in favour of appellant (Singh). We are converting the punishment of death sentence into the life imprisonment."
    Singh, son of former senior IPS officer, had challenged his conviction and death sentence awarded by the Delhi High Court which had set aside his acquittal by the trial court in the case.

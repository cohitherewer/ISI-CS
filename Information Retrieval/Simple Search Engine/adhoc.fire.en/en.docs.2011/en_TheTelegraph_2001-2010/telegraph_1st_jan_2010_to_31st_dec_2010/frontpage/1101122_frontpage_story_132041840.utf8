                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Congress demands dissolution of Karnataka Assembly
				       
	Bangalore, Nov 22 (PTI): Opposition Congress today demanded that Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa should recommend the dissolution of state Assembly, saying his government had lost the moral right to continue in office in the wake of the spate of corruption charges faced by it.  
	 "This government should go. It has lost the trust of people. The government is facing unprecedented scale of corruption (charges). All ministers of the Yeddyruappa government are party to the corruption," Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah told reporters.  
	 If the BJP high command failed to secure Yeddyurappa's resignation, Congress will launch a state-wide agitation against the government, he warned.  
	The administrative machinery has collapsed in the state, he charged as Yeddyurappa came under intense pressure to quit following the allegations of land scam involving his family.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rift in JMM over Hemant 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rift in JMM over Hemant 
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA amp; AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, April 29: Hemant Soren announced that the JMM had no objection in backing the BJP to form a government, indicating he was ready to take on those in the party opposed to such a proposal.        
	The JMMs support to the BJP, announced at a late night press conference, however, came with the rider that the next chief minister should be a tribal, a move that seemed to mar the prospects of deputy chief minister and BJP leader Raghubar Das becoming chief minister.        
	Maintaining that political instability should end immediately, Hemant said Guruji would resign once the BJP took the initiative to form a government. We are with the NDA and accept the BJPs chief minister, he said.         
	It was clear though that the offer to the BJP hadnt gone down well within the JMM with as many as eight MLAs questioning his authority to speak on behalf of the party.        
	We were with the UPA and should remain with the natural alliance. Hemants only qualification is that he is Shibu Sorens son, said Simon Marandi who walked out of a JMM legislature party meet held this morning.         
	Not ready to accept BJP as the leader of the alliance, disgruntled JMM MLAs even explored the possibility of splitting the party.         
	Marandi and Teklal Mahto said they had the support of at least eight of the 18 JMM MLAs and claimed more would join them in the days to come. Others in this group are Nalin Soren, Lobin Hembrom, Bidyut Baran Mahto, Jagannath Mahto, Champai Soren and significantly, Sita Soren, the widow of Sorens elder son, Durga.        
	All of them held a separate close-door meeting at the MLAs guesthouse.        
	The group against Hemant needs the support of at least 12 of the 18 MLAs to split the party and escape disqualification under the anti-defection law.         
	 Asked about the brewing dissent, Hemant feigned ignorance. The JMM is united, he claimed at the press conference.         
	Significantly, he was flanked by JMM youth wing president Vinod Pandey and Sorens press advisor, Shafique Ansari.        
	No party MLA was present.

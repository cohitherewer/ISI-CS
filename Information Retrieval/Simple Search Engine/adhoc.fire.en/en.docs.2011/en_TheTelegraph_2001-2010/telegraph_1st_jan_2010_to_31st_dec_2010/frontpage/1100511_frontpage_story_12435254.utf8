The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Guruji rams through JMM consensus
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Guruji rams through JMM consensus
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                               
	Ranchi, May 10: The pro and anti-BJP camps in the JMM legislature party arrived at a tenuous truce today with chief minister Shibu Soren presiding over a marathon four-hour meeting of MLAs after which his son Hemant claimed they had agreed to be part of a government headed by the national party.        
	As many as four of the 18 JMM MLAs stayed away. They were Sita Soren, Champai Soren, Lobin Hembrom and Paulus Surin, who is in jail.         
	While welfare minister Haji Hussain Ansari joined Hemant to say that the legislature party was intact and had reiterated its decision to support a BJP-led government, known opponents of this line claimed otherwise.        
	Dissident MLA Simon Marandi claimed the JMM was divided into two camps. One group is supporting the BJP, while the other wants Soren to continue as chief minister. So, no consensus could be evolved, he said, adding that Guruji was silent throughout todays meeting.         
	Hemant said all MLAs were briefed about the issues on which the JMM negotiated with the BJP for political stability in the state. Referring to dissidents like Simon and others, he claimed they had been cautioned against pushing the state towards fresh elections.         
	We have backed the BJP to rise above party politics. Now, the BJP should observe coalition dharma and take the initiative to form a stable government, he said.        
	He also asked the BJP parliamentary board to review its decision and agree to the JMMs proposal of running the government on rotation.        
	Earlier in the day, Simon held a meeting with fellow dissidents Teklal Mahto and Nalin Soren. Congress leader Stephen Marandi also joined them for sometime.         
	Though Simon counted Hembrom as one among them, the Borio MLA clarified to The Telegraph that he backed Gurujis decision. I could not attend the meeting as I was busy with a marriage in my constituency, he added.         
	Significantly, Sorens daughter-in-law Sita, who was in Bokaro, said she was not in favour of the JMM supporting a BJP-led government. She, however, said she was with Guruji even if he quit. Samay ke sath chalenge (I will move with the tide), she said.

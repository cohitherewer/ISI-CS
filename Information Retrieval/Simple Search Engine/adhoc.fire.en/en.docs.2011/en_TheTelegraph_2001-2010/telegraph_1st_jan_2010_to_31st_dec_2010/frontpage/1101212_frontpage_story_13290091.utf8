          ADAM NAGOURNEY                            Nixon: Layer of complexity                                  
	Yorba Linda (California), Dec. 11: Richard M. Nixon made disparaging remarks about Jews, blacks, Italian-Americans and Irish-Americans in a series of extended conversations with top aides and his personal secretary, recorded in the Oval Office 16 months before he resigned as President.        
	The remarks were contained in 265 hours of recordings, captured by the secret taping system Nixon had installed in the White House and released this week by the Nixon Presidential Library.        
	While previous recordings have detailed Nixons animosity toward Jews, including those who served in his administration like Henry A. Kissinger, his national security adviser, these tapes suggest an added layer of complexity to Nixons feeling. He and his aides seem to make a distinction between Israeli Jews, whom Nixon admired, and American Jews.        
	In a conversation on February 13, 1973, with Charles W. Colson, a senior adviser who had just told Nixon that he had always had a little prejudice, Nixon said he was not prejudiced but continued: Ive just recognised that, you know, all people have certain traits.        
	The Jews have certain traits, he said. The Irish have certain  for example, the Irish cant drink. What you always have to remember with the Irish is they get mean. Virtually every Irish Ive known gets mean when he drinks. Particularly the real Irish.        
	Nixon continued: The Italians, of course, those people course dont have their heads screwed on tight. They are wonderful people, but, and his voice trailed off.        
	A moment later, Nixon returned to Jews: The Jews are just a very aggressive and abrasive and obnoxious personality. At another point, in a long and wandering conversation with Rose Mary Woods, his personal secretary, that veered from whom to invite to a state dinner to whether Woods should get her hair done, Nixon offered sharp scepticism at the views of William P. Rogers, his secretary of state, about the future of black Africans.        
	Bill Rogers has got  to his credit its a decent feeling  but somewhat sort of a blind spot on the black thing because hes been in New York, Nixon said. He says well, They are coming along, and that after all they are going to strengthen our country in the end because they are strong physically and some of them are smart.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | One more steel plant for Bokaro
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                One more steel plant for Bokaro
          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                            Virbhadra Singh in Bokaro on Friday. (Pankaj Singh)                                  
	Bokaro, Jan. 29: Bokaro will soon boast a second steel plant.        
	Announcing this today at the end of his two-day visit to Bokaro, Union minister for steel Virbhadra Singh said Bokaro had 44,000 acres to spare and that would be used to set up a new plant in joint venture with a global player like Posco or some other reputed steel maker. A new power plant was also in the pipeline.         
	 The new steel plant will be exclusive of the existing one that is being modernised to increase its capacity from the present 4.5 million tonnes to 7.44 million tonnes in the next two years, the Union steel minister said. He added that those displaced because of the expansion would be provided employment.        
	Speaking about Chiria mines, which has been a bone of contention between Jharkhand and SAIL, the minister said the state government had agreed to give 1,000 million tonnes of iron ore from Chiria mines to the Bokaro plant. However, SAIL, keeping in mind its ongoing expansion drive, has demanded 2,000 million tonnes.         
	Expressing concern over the absence of institutes of higher education in the region, the steel minister invited big universities with experience in technical education to help set up engineering and professional colleges.         
	Singh said SAILs ongoing modernisation and expansion drive would cost Rs 72,000 crore and would enhance production to the tune of 124 million tonnes after the first phase. To increase production further, the minister said money would be borrowed from the market through an IPO or similar means.        
	Speaking on behalf of SAIL, chairman S.K. Rungta said the steel behemoth was contemplating taking over the closed Sindri fertilizer factory to set up another steel unit at the spot.         
	Asking the displaced to support the expansion that will benefit them in the future, Singh promised more civic facilities in the township, including a new bridge to connect Bokaro with Chas.

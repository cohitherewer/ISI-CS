                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Soren, son spat over CMs chair
  - Party wants Torpa MLA to stay on           SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                     
	Ranchi, April 25: Chief minister Shibu Soren made it clear that he was not ready to give up his chair, even for his son, and that he would fight the bypolls to get himself elected to the Assembly, bringing out into the open for the first time the power struggle known to have been simmering within the family.        
	Sorens assertion came at a crucial JMM legislature party meeting, called to discuss the possible constituency Guruji would opt for. Though the chief minister would not announce where he would contest from, he did rule out Torpa and Ghatshila.        
	Dumka MP Soren was sworn in as chief minister on December 30. He has to get elected to the Assembly before June 29 to continue in office.         
	According to JMM spokesman Simon Marandi, at the meeting, the chief ministers son and Dumka MLA Hemant tried to put it across that his father was not well and should thus rest, only to have his suggestion rejected outright by Guruji who said he would fight the elections and continue in office.        
	Of the 18 JMM MLAs, four  Sita Soren, Vishnu Bhaiya, Teklal Mahto and Paulus Surin (in jail)  were not present at the meeting.        
	Earlier, Soren, accompanied by HRD minister Hemlal Murmu, welfare minister Haji Hussain Ansari and Hemant, informally met Speaker C.P. Singh and requested him not to accept Paulus Surins resignation.        
	The speaker had rushed special secretary Samrendra Pandey and additional secretary Vinay Kumar Singh to Simdega jail to verify whether the resignation letter sent by Surin was genuine and whether it had been submitted under pressure.        
	Surin, according to sources, told Assembly officials that he was under pressure from people close to the chief minister to withdraw his resignation and that he would do so.        
	JMM spokesperson Marandi said a few party MLAs expressed the opinion that Hemant should be allowed to take over the baton from Guruji. But Guruji was not ready for it and declared that he would contest the elections. He will announce the seat tomorrow, the Littipara MLA said, adding that Guruji was the consensus leader of the JMM and his decision was final.        
	The JMM central executive committee later also endorsed Soren to take decisions in the interest of the state as well as the party. Former land reforms and revenue minister Dulal Bhuiyan said Soren was free to select the constituency out of the 18 seats held by the JMM to contest the elections. The party is solidly behind him, he maintained.

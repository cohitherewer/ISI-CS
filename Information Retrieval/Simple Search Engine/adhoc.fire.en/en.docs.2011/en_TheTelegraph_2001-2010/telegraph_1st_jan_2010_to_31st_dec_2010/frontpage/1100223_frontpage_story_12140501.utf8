  - Indias most expensive car with promise of protection against bullets and shrapnel           OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 22: Money cant buy happiness but a few crores can try keeping you safe on the road in this age of terror.        
	The most expensive car in India was launched today with a price tag of Rs 6 crore, promising not just a feel-good dreamboat but also a feel-safe fortress. The armour can apparently withstand high-intensity blasts.        
	Mercedes-Benzs S-Guard offers protection from large-calibre revolver ammunition, rifle-launched projectiles and shrapnel from three hand grenades at a time  once seen in movies and in Iraq but no longer inconceivable in clusters of everyday life.        
	The limousine also flaunts James Bond-style features: it can run on flat tyres, its fuel tank seals on its own to avert explosions and it has a fire-extinguishing system. The vehicle has infra-red head-lamps and night-view assistance systems.        
	Built on the platform of the S-600, the S-Guard outprices the Maybach, also from the Mercedes-Benz stable, which comes at a starting rate of Rs 5.5 crore.        
	The S-Guard was showcased at the recently held auto expo in New Delhi and was launched today in the country.        
	This car is basically targeted at corporate and industry leaders, government officials and celebrities. We want to tap the growing market for armoured and protective vehicles in India, said Suhas Kadlaskar, a member of the board of management of Mercedes-Benz India.        
	The company is promoting the car as a total mobile security concept. We have received enquiries from interested customers for the S-Guard. The exact price of the car will depend on specifications sought by individuals and import duty, said Kadlaskar.                          
	The S-Guard will come as completely built unit from the companys plant in Germany.        
	Asked about the sales target, Kadlaskar said: Rather than figures, we want to provide quality security to our customers.        
	Some Indian industrialists have shown a preference for the Merc. Mukesh Ambani has an S-600 while brother Anil has S-500 and Ratan Tata an E-320.        
	Among politicians, the Prime Minister has a Merc among his official fleet while Sonia Gandhi uses a Tata Safari. Narendra Modi uses a bullet-proof Scorpio and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee a bullet-proof Ambassador.

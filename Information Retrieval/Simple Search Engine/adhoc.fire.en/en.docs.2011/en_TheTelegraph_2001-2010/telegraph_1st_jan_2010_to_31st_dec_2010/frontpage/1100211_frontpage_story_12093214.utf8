The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | If not Sena, then love-killer cameras 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                If not Sena, then love-killer cameras 
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 10: If Mumbai movie halls accept the Maharashtra governments advice on how to screen My Name is Khan, director Karan Johars most enduring contribution yet to the world of make-believe  its all about love  could be the first casualty.        
	Correction: the second casualty. The first will be the three rows of seats from the front.        
	The government has suggested measures such as empty front rows and CCTV cameras with night vision  the prying eyes of which, some hall owners feel, will keep off romantic couples in the Valentines Day week  as part of its efforts to take on the Shiv Sena which has threatened to disrupt the screening of My Name is Khan. The film is set to be released on Friday.         
	But most theatres in Mumbai refused to begin advance bookings for the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer as they were not convinced by the governments promise of security.        
	The decision followed an attack by suspected Sena activists on Broadway, a single-screen theatre in suburban Kandivili. Yesterday, three cinemas had been targeted. Reports of similar aggressive protests by the Sena came from other parts of the city, including Kanjurmarg, Bandra and Khar.        
	Police went into overdrive to convince theatre owners of the security arrangements. The police said at least 1,600 Sena supporters had been taken into preventive custody along with 59 branch-level leaders.         
	The Sena stuck to its stand that only an apology from Shah Rukh for backing Pakistani cricketers ignored for the Indian Premier League would end the standoff.         
	We have stopped advance bookings for the film as of now. It may open, but nothing is certain, said Girish Wankhede, deputy general manager (corporate communications) of Cinemax.        
	PVR, Cinemax, Anil Ambanis Big Cinemas and Fun Cinemas kept advance booking counters closed. Only INOX, which has two plexes  at Nariman Point and Santa Cruz, neither of them Sena strongholds  resumed advance sales.         
	On an average, the Mumbai circle accounts for nearly 35-45 per cent of a Bollywood films worldwide revenues. Aamir Khans 3 Idiots has so far earned Rs 150 crore from the Mumbai circle out of its global collections of about Rs 382 crore.         
	The state government, which has been sending out strongly worded sound bites, chose to leave some room for compromise.         
	Chief minister Ashok Chavan, who had threatened to withdraw security cover for Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray, said in the evening the row should be resolved through mutual understanding.        
	Theatre owners also scoffed at the guideline asking them to keep the front three rows empty during the screening.         
	Who will bear the cost? They have told us they will post just two uniformed security personnel inside every theatre along with a couple of plainclothesmen. How will that help in case of trouble? asked Manohar Desai, who owns G-7 theatres in the Bandra area.        
	The other sore point is the missive that theatres install CCTVs with night-vision, which would later help the police identify troublemakers.        
	This means they have decided they wont be able to take action during any act of vandalism, but do an investigation later. Besides, couples, wishing to celebrate Valentines Day, will not come if they know CCTV cameras are watching them, said the vice-president (sales) of a multiplex chain.        
	The third guideline asks theatre owners to station private security guards near screens.

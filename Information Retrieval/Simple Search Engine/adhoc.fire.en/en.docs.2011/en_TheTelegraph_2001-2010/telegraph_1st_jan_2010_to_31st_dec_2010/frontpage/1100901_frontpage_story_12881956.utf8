The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Taint bars Pak trio from nets 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Taint bars Pak trio from nets 
                            
	Aug. 31 (Agencies): Pakistan Test skipper Salman Butt and pacers Mohammed Aamir and Mohammed Asif were today barred from nets and summoned to London tomorrow for a meeting with the Pakistan high commissioner and board chief to discuss the fixing allegations against them.        
	The debarment came amid speculation that the Pakistan Cricket Board could suspend the trio under pressure from its English counterpart, though the PCB said it would not act till it received a final inquiry report by Thursday.        
	As of now, the three players are part of the squad for the ODI and T20 series against England starting Sunday.        
	Reports said customs authorities had arrested Mazhar Majeed, the bookie and player agent at the heart of the scandal, along with his wife and his brother Azhar in connection with money-laundering related to the fixing charges but later released them. Majeed was earlier arrested by police and freed on bail.         
	Pakistan team manager Yawar Saeed said Salman, Asif and Aamir did not have nets because they were preparing for tomorrows meeting at the Pakistan mission, where a British legal expert would be present along with PCB chairman Ijaz Butt.        
	The PCB chief and the high commissioner will talk to the players in front of the legal expert and decide the future course of action, a team source said.        
	The source said the practice bar was meant to keep the media glare off the trio. The rest of the team held a closed training session ahead of Thursdays practice game at Taunton, Somerset.         
	Unconfirmed reports said a three-member team from Pakistans Federal Investigation Agency had arrived to join the investigation by Scotland Yard, which could question the players again.        
	UK tabloid News of the World had videotaped Majeed claiming he had bribed seven Pakistani cricketers to ensure Aamir and Asif would bowl three no-balls at predetermined points during the just-ended Lords Test.         
	A report claimed the police had last weekend seized 50,000 in cash from Salmans hotel room, the player claiming it was meant for his sisters trousseau. Asif has reportedly told investigators that it was Salman who introduced Majeed to the players.        
	Asif could now lose his chance to act in a Malayalam film. Lyricist Kaithapram Damodaran Namboodiri, who had drafted the pacer for his directorial debut Mazhavillinnattamvare, said: I will wait for a few more days. If the allegation is true he will be dropped on moral grounds.        
	Australian cricketer Shane Watson has said a suspected Mumbai gangster approached him during last years tour of England.

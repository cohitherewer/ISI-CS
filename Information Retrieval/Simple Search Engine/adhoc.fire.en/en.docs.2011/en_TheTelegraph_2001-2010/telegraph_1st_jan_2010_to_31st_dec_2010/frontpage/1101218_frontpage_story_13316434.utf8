  - Tired party finds weapon   after campus clashes        OUR BUREAU                      The poster                                      
	Calcutta, Dec. 17: The confrontation at Hazra crossing yesterday revealed a Marxist frontline devoid of the usual grey eminence: that vacuum was filled by jeans-wearing and backpack-carrying foot soldiers barely out of their teens.        
	Campus violence has handed the CPM, which is scraping the barrel to come up with a big idea to stem the steady slide, a chance to unleash on the Trinamul Congress its youth brigade.        
	 At this juncture, the youth have to come forward, CPM state secretary Biman Bose said today, referring to the death of Swapan Koley, a BCom student from Howrah, and the possibly irreparable damage to the eye of another student, Souvik Hazra, from Behala.        
	Those squatting at Hazra on Thursday, marching towards Mamata Banerjees home or voicing the Left stand in television studios were not the usual faces. They were also smart and fleet-footed enough to click their bleeding friend on a cellphone camera, blow up the picture, take colour printouts and use them on placards -- all within an hour.        
	Technology has vastly advanced. our youths took advantage. The digitised photograph proves the escalating violence let loose by Trinamul on the (Asutosh College) campus, said Bose, who, unlike the mobile-savvy Mamata Banerjee, is not seen as too tech-friendly.        
	Trinamul seemed to have sensed the shift. The CPM has realised its present leadership is no longer inspiring people. It is unacceptable. That is why it is using the students front against Mamata Banerjee, said Sudip Bandopadhyay, Trinamul MP and chief whip in the Lok Sabha.        
	If Bandopadhyay gave a spiel that suits his politics, what about the marketing spin?        
	Tired brands often get new brand ambassadors or change their logo to renew the interest. The CPM may well have taken a leaf out of a marketing strategists book. Catch them young is a good strategy for any political party. Majority of the voters are below 25, said market research veteran Shiloo Chattopadhyay.         
	Is putting the students in the frontline going to be the strategy here on in? This protest is all about students. Trinamul is unleashing violence on campuses. So, students have to react, said a relatively younger CPM senior leader.        
	Those familiar with the CPMs political organisation said yesterdays incident gave the leadership a chance to channel spontaneity.         
	Not that the young channelled their anger all by themselves. CPM insiders said the young guns on the road had been guided by elders in the party, though they did not take the name of he chief minister, who was directly blamed by Mamata yesterday.        
	Members of the CPMs South Bhowanipore local committee and senior SFI leaders swung into action after Souvik got hit. They decided on the procession with Souviks blood-splattered image.        
	The beleaguered older brigade took over the baton today. From chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and CPM state secretary Bose to ministers Gautam Deb and Manab Mukherjee and senior leaders Mohammad Salim and Sujan Chakraborty, the leadership was out in full strength on Friday to grieve for the students.         
	The violence prompted Governor M.K. Narayanan to issue a statement saying he was greatly worried and deeply grieved. The governor appealed to students to refrain from violence with a reminder that campus clashes need to be put down with a firm hand.        
	History will not forgive us if we condone the violence being unleashed within, and outside, the universities and even schools, he said.        
	Little on Friday suggested the governors call would be heeded. Bose bluntly stated: A mere protest will not do. Resist them at any cost. Self-defence is a right.        
	Mamata Banerjee retorted that the CPM was behaving like a cry baby. It appears that we are in power and they are in the Opposition.         
	Four Trinamul Chhatra Parishad supporters have been arrested  one in Andul and three in Calcutta. Two of those held in Calcutta are Asutosh College students and the other an alumnus.        
	Located in a Trinamul bastion less than a kilometre from Mamatas house, Asutosh College is what the village Armorica is to the Gauls. Many CPM student leaders, including SFI state president Kaustav Chatterjee, have learnt their ropes there.         
	Besides students like Koley and Hazra, the campus violence has an obvious victim  education. Very often we are asked by the police to leave before 8pm. Classes are forcibly shut. We dont want this to go on, said Ushasie Chakraborty, economics teacher at Shyamaprasad College, which runs from the Asutosh College building at night.

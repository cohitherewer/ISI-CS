The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Landmark plays with fire 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Landmark plays with fire

	They were built by the same person and bear his name. If steps are not taken, they could share the same fate too. Sundays fire at Stephen House was put out quickly but the insides of the BBD Bag building warn of a disaster on the scale of the one at Stephen Court on Park Street in March. Metro walks through Stephen House and decodes the danger signals.         
	The building        
	About 1,000 employees work in the six-storeyed Stephen House in the heart of the citys business district. About 200 offices  some so small that they   
	can accommodate only one person  have their addresses in the landmark building, which is over 80 years old. The ground floor houses bank branches, bookstores and mobile service shops.   
	Stephen House has two entry points  one facing Dalhousie Square and the other RN Mukherjee Road. The two portions of the building have two staircases each. Above the fourth floor, illegal constructions have severed the link between the two parts. Alterations to the original building plan have over the years narrowed the stairs and corridors.         
	There used to be four to five toilets on all the floors. Those were gradually converted into offices and sold off, said an employee of a government office in the building.        
	The horror unfolds as one goes up the building. The narrow winding stairs lead to narrower corridors encroached by furniture, makeshift kitchens and merchandise.        
	Many occupants have built false ceilings as well as mezzanine floors, said an employee of an office on the third floor.         
	Electrical wiring        
	The outer walls of the building are covered by mesh of electrical wires hanging from windows and air conditioners. To make the offices attractive, their occupants have shoved the wires outside. As a result, you can see thousands of metres of wires hanging outside, said a customer care executive of a share trading firm pointing to the maze outside the canteen of his first-floor office.        
	According to those who work in the building, sparks and smoke are seen almost every week in some part of the building. But luckily there has been no Stephen Court here. But there is no guarantee that it would not happen, said another employee of the share brokering firm.         
	Air-conditioners        
	There is no official estimate of the number of air-conditioners keeping offices in Stephen House cool.        
	There are nearly 250 air-conditioners installed in Stephen House. There is no official policy on installing and operating air-conditioners. Anyone can install an air-conditioner or upgrade an old one by bribing the caretaker of the building. As a result, some offices have installed more than five air-conditioners, exerting severe load on the system, said the manager of a godown on the fourth floor.         
	Fire-safety measures        
	Firemen who rushed to douse the flames that were spotted on the ground floor of Stephen House on Sunday did not find a single extinguisher or water reservoir.        
	The building has no fire fighting arrangement. It is flouting all fire safety norms. Thankfully, the fire broke out on the ground floor and on a Sunday. Had it been any other floor and any other day, the loss could have been huge, said a fireman.         
	Voices        
	A disaster is waiting to happen at Stephen House. The fire department had carried out several inspections and warned the building authorities but no action has been taken, said divisional fire officer Tapan Das.         
	Building caretaker Ravinder Singh was reluctant to speak on the matter. All the allegations are baseless because till now nobody was even injured in any of the fires that broke out here, he said.

  - Upset over JD-U backstab, BJP talks of reviewing alliance          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                             Shibu Soren blesses KD Singh in Ranchi on Thursday. (Prashant Mitra)                                        
	Ranchi, June 17: JMM and Congress nominees sailed through to the Rajya Sabha from Jharkhand today with substantially more votes than required, embarrassing the BJP that was forced to eat humble pie by its cross-voting ally, the JD(U).        
	The JMM nominee, Alchemist Group chairman Kanwar Deep Singh, won with 32 votes  he needed only 28  with the support of Lalu Prasads RJD and Ajsu, while the Congress-JVM nominee, Dheeraj Prasad Sahu, bagged 28 votes  he would have got the two more votes that were declared invalid.         
	BJP nominee Ajay Maroo, though never a front runner, bagged only 17 of the 20 votes he was expected to get.         
	The controversial JMM nominee bagged the votes of MLAs belonging to JMM (18), Ajsu (5) and RJD (5), two Independents  Chamra Linda and Videsh Singh. The two extra votes came from the JD(U).         
	The Congresss Sahu bagged 28 votes including those of Bandhu Tirkey, Geeta Koda, Arup Chatterjee (MCC) and possibly Hari Narayan Rai and Anosh Ekka, the two tainted MLAs.         
	In all, 79 of the 81 votes were cast of which two were declared invalid.         
	The BJPs Kanke MLA Ram Chandra Baitha did not turn up saying he had a puja to perform even after party general secretary Arjun Munda met him personally.        
	CPI(ML) MLA Vinod Singh kept his promise of boycotting the elections.         
	If K.D. Singh was ecstatic at his victory, the BJP was left fuming. We were in the fray to keep the flock together. It should have been the duty of the JD(U) central leadership to maintain the alliance, said Munda.        
	State JD(U) chief Jaleshwar Mahto ducked for cover by promising to complain about their two defiant MLAs to the party leadership.         
	A jubilant K.D. Singh, however, had to defend his victory. We were short by three votes, but got 32. So, why should we buy that many votes. In fact, the extra votes I got came from secular parties like Lalu Prasads RJD, he said to counter allegations that he had lured MLAs with financial rewards.        
	Now that he had won, K D Singh said he would fulfil his promise to set two super-speciality hospitals in Silli and Dumka within six months.         
	Later, there was considerable confusion over the two invalid votes. While BJPs Maroo, who was inside the polling station, said two votes belonged to Phoolchand Mandal (JVM) and Arup Chatterjee (MCC), Congress leader Rajendra Prasad Singh and JVM general secretary Pravin Singh denied it vehemently.         
	The JVM leader claimed the two JD(U) votes of Raja Peter and Sudha Chaudhary were declared invalid, while the Congress leader asserted that the jailed tainted MLAs did not vote for its nominee.         
	Significantly, five RJD legislators also voted for Singh during the dying minutes of the election around 3 pm. RJD legislature party leader Annapurna Devi said they voted for the Chandigarh-based business tycoon after an okay from Lalu Prasad.         
	State BJP president Raghubar Das was incommunicado. But Munda said, Baitha will face action for his defiance. Maroo explained that the numbers were never in his favour. But it was unfortunate the JD(U) did not vote for us. The central leadership should take a call on it and review the alliance with the party, he demanded, making it clear that the two JD(U) MLAs, Raja Peter and Sudha Chaudhury, were allowed a free run.         
	Moreover, he said, the election had exposed the shady character of state MLAs. Thailishah yahan se 32 votes lekar jeet jatey hain. (A moneybag is able to take away 32 votes and win), he said, adding, It has defamed Jharkhand.         
	JMM chief Shibu Soren said the poll outcome had proved the his MLAs could not be distracted by baseless charges. In a statement, he said,There was a bid to create outsider-insider divide. But, I believe that all those who help Jharkhand develop are Jharkhandis.

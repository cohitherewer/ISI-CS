The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rush on parallel school bill
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rush on parallel school bill
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Calcutta, July 28: The Left Front government has fast-tracked the creation of a parallel school education system under the panchayat and rural development department, ignoring opposition from both within and outside the coalition.         
	The government is pitching the bill as a tool to bring more students to schools, but has stoked fears that a system under the panchayat and rural development department  which does not have the expertise to run an education system  will expose students in rural Bengal to inferior standards.         
	Instead of scrutinising the provisions of the bill, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government introduced the West Bengal Panchayat Board of Education Bill, 2010, in the Assembly yesterday.         
	A section of veteran CPM teacher-leaders had met the party leadership yesterday and urged a rethink on the bill, a source in the party headquarters said. However, according to the source, the government did not want to spend time analysing the costs and benefits of the bill.         
	The bruised government is banking heavily on the job creation potential  more than 56,000 teachers apart from other employees  of the bill to court voters before the elections next year.        
	Deputy Speaker Bhaktipada Ghosh today referred the bill to the Assembly standing committee on panchayat and rural development. Anisur Rahman, the minister in charge of the department, said the bill would be referred back to the Assembly the day after tomorrow to get the seal of approval of the House.         
	The bill does not feature on the list of business of the House for the remaining two days of this session. But the government can get the bill tabled for its approval, a mere formality for the Left Front government given its numbers.         
	Such a rushed approach to get a bill passed on the floor of the Assembly is rare. It seems the government is desperate to pass it and claim credit before the Assembly polls, said a CPM insider opposed to the provisions.        
	The bill aims at setting up the West Bengal Board of Panchayat Education, which will affiliate 16,108 sishu siksha kendras that hold classes from I to IV and 1,900 Madhyamik siksha kendras (MSKs) that run classes from V to VIII. It has provisions to extend the MSKs till Class X and conduct the Class X-level school-leaving examination.         
	Creating proper syllabi, recruiting teachers for schools, maintaining their standards and ensuring smooth transition of the students to the next level require a lot of planning. I am afraid, all these things have been overlooked, said the leader of a CPM-backed teachers union.         
	We will fight tooth and nail to stop the government from setting up a parallel school education board under the panchayat and rural development department, said Manik Bhattacharya, the chairman of the West Bengal Trinamul Congress Education Cell.

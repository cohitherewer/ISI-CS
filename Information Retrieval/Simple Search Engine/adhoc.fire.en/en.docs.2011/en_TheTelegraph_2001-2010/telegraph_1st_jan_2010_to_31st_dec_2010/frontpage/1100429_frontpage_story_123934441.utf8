	Bangalore, April 29 (PTI): The ISRO today said it has rescheduled the May 9 launch of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C15), that was to put into space the country's advanced, high-resolution remote-sensing spacecraft Cartosat-2B and four other satellites.  
	"A marginal drop in the pressure in the second stage of the vehicle was noticed during mandatory checks carried out on the PSLV-C15 vehicle," the Bangalore-headquartered Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said in a statement here.  
	"The new date for the launch of PSLV-C15 mission will be decided after preliminary results of the analysis are obtained," it said.  
	The launch was slated for May 9 at 9.23 am from Sriharikota spaceport in Andhra Pradesh.  
	Apart from Cartosat-2B, PSLV-C15 is planned to launch an Algerian satellite ALSAT-2A, two nano satellites NLS 6.1 and NLS 6.

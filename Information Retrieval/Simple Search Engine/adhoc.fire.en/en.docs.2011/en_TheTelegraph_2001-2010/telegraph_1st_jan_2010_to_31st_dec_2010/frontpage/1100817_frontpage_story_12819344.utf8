  - Security and scandals put   difficult decision on lips         IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: New Zealand is keeping its options open on participating in the Commonwealth Games, formally saying a time may come when a difficult decision may have to be taken following security concerns and shoddy preparations.        
	We believe it is premature to make a decision at this stage although we acknowledge that ultimately, there may come a time when a difficult decision may have to be made by NZOC (the New Zealand Olympics Committee) or the games organisers, the chief of the New Zealand Federation of Athletes, Robert Nichol, has written to The Telegraph.        
	Nichol was responding to the specific question: What are your views on participating in the Commonwealth Games?        
	The Indian government is certain to launch efforts to remove the misgivings but the lack of an unequivocal commitment by New Zealand less than 50 days before the October 3 launch of the event in Delhi is a stunning statement on the impact of the scandals across the border.        
	If New Zealand remains unconvinced, the reservations could trigger a domino effect. Concerns have been raised in Australia and Canada, too, though there is no official statement from the two countries.        
	The Telegraph emailed a questionnaire to Nichol after a source in Delhi police said New Zealand had asked for details of the security arrangements and safety procedures for its athletes.        
	The paper asked Nichol if he had written to the organisers for updates on arrangements and safety concerns, whether he had been in touch with Delhi police and if New Zealands decision would depend on the feedback from its representative who is expected to be in Delhi next month to review the preparations.        
	We have not been provided with a copy of the Delhi police security plan. It would certainly help if either ourselves or our security experts were able to be provided with confidential access to it.         
	That way we would be able to not just consider what specific security and safety measures will be put in place but also ensure what is promised can and will be delivered on, and that is crucial, Nichol has written.        
	The Indian government, Organising Committee and Delhi police are asking us to trust them when it comes to the security and safety of the athletes. Hearing of these allegations and witnessing the controversy makes this more difficult, Nichol added.        
	Seventy other countries are expected to participate in the Games.         
	International concern over the preparations for the Games may have been one of the factors that prompted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to step in on Saturday and make Suresh Kalmadi and the organising committee more accountable.        
	It is important that we remain calm, not be alarmist and focus on a very thorough process of assessing the security risk and plans, Nichol wrote.        
	Authorities in New Zealand, he said, were following reports on the Games. The issues that have appeared around the organising committee, facilities and Games themselves are of concern, although it is hard to know what has substance and what does not, Nichol said.        
	Representatives of a few countries had phoned the Central Vigilance Commissions office to enquire how safe the venues were after disclosures on poor construction.        
	Nichol said that his Athletes Federation, through the New Zealand Olympic Committee, had asked for copies of risk assessment reports.        
	We have also tabled with them areas we are concerned about, he wrote. There are several areas that we have been able to isolate where we feel improvements can be made and we are pushing for those.         
	A senior officer of Delhi police said officials from the New Zealand Olympic Committee and some other countries had pressed for more security personnel with the teams as they were not satisfied with the security system. They are extremely concerned about the safety and security of the players. In September, officials from participating countries will arrive to take a closer look, the officer said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Thank you, Maam, please come again and keep roads rally-free

          KINSUK BASU                                              
	Question: Who will be the most popular person in Calcutta on Wednesday?        
	Answer: Patil.        
	Question: Patil, who?        
	Answer: President Pratibha Patil.        
	Calcutta police have barred at least three organisations from holding demonstrations on Rani Rashmoni Avenue on Wednesday and Thursday so that President Pratibha Patil has a smooth ride.        
	It means other people, who are denied the right to movement on many days in the heart of Calcutta, can also expect fewer impediments on the road.        
	Efforts are on to persuade an organisation of teachers to shift its demonstration from Metro Channel on both days, though it has promised a small gathering with little disruption potential.        
	The President is scheduled to leave on Thursday morning but the police have not allowed any rally the entire day so that they are not left red in the face in the event of a change of her plan.        
	Rani Rashmoni Avenue goes west towards the All India Radio office from the intersection of Jawaharlal Nehru Road and SN Banerjee Road. That is where the SUCI strangled commuters with envy-evoking success on Monday.         
	Patil would have taken almost an hour to cross Esplanade from Park Street on Monday afternoon if she were not the First Citizen.        
	Her trip to the Oberoi Grand from Raj Bhavan on Wednesday evening for the All India Management Associations convention has necessitated the clampdown, police sources said.         
	Many dignitaries have stayed at Raj Bhavan but few, according to police sources, had to make the kilometre-long trip from the governors house to the hotel in the recent past.        
	We could not have taken chances, knowing how clogged the arteries become once the heart of the city is choked, a police officer said, oblivious to the irony that the law-enforcers have rarely lifted a finger to come to the aid of countless ordinary Calcuttans who suffer the daily ordeal in silence.        
	On record, there is nothing to suggest that any demonstration has been barred because all rallies blocking roads in the area are illegal. Weekday rallies are banned from everywhere except the base of the Shahid Minar.         
	But what plays out every day is a farce with political outfits and organisations keeping the police posted before going about the business of crippling traffic.        
	There were several applicants who wanted to hold demonstrations on RR Avenue on Wednesday and Thursday but we told them this would not be possible since it comes in the way of the Presidents route, a senior officer said at Lalbazar.         
	The officer refused to name the organisations that had been told to put off their programmes. Its not too often when we can turn down such applications, he added.        
	There will not be any rally on RR Avenue. Lets not get into why there wont be any, a senior traffic police officer said.        
	The police are still struggling to dissuade the Nikhil Banga Prathamik Sikshak Samiti from holding a sit-in at the Metro Channel on Wednesday and Thursday. It may be coincidental, but the organisation is CPM-backed.        
	The samitis leaders have told the Lalbazar brass they had booked the venue a month ago and had not been told about the Presidents visit then.        
	They will sit on a stage from Wednesday noon to Thursday evening. They have told us it will not be a big affair, said a senior officer of the traffic police. Besides, the President is not scheduled to go past Metro Channel on any of her trips from Raj Bhavan.         
	Many Calcuttans trapped in long snarls at Chowringhee on Monday expressed the wish that the President came to the city more often and stayed longer. The President should stay in the city at least for a few days every month to spare us from the horror of these rallies, said stock market analyst Anuj Khatwani.

          K.P. NAYAR                            External affairs minister SM Krishna speaks at the UN General Assembly in New York on Wednesday. (PTI)                                   
	New York, Sept. 29: Weeklong efforts to take an Indo-Pak thaw forward through a meeting of their foreign ministers in New York collapsed yesterday after Islamabads top diplomat Shah Mehmood Qureshi told the UN General Assembly that we strongly condemn this brutality in Kashmir.        
	He also urged the international community to persuade India to end its repression in Kashmir.        
	In a swift retort within less than two hours, external affairs minister S.M. Krishna told Qureshi to attend to his problems at home instead of offering gratuitous advice to India.        
	In response to a question at the Asia Society here, Krishna said: Pakistan is a country that has enormous and serious challenges confronting it. Such unsolicited and untenable remarks will not, and indeed cannot, divert attention from the multiple problems Pakistan needs to tackle for the common good of its people, and indeed of the entire region.        
	The Indian delegation to the General Assembly had come to New York ready to hold talks with Qureshi: foreign secretary Nirupama Rao remained with Krishna during his entire stay here and as prospects of talks with Pakistan mounted, Yash Sinha, South Blocks senior official in charge of Pakistan, arrived in New York yesterday to join any bilateral discussions.         
	But by raising Kashmir at the UN, Qureshi broke a six-year informal understanding between India and Pakistan not to make matters worse between them by attacking each other on the festering dispute in their General Assembly speeches.         
	It left Krishna with few options. Today, in his address to the General Assembly, the Indian minister responded to what Qureshi had told the general debate yesterday.         
	Many countries have deep-rooted concerns about the growth and consolidation of militancy and terrorism in Pakistan, he told the UN. We share these concerns, particularly because Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of India, is the target of such Pakistan-sponsored militancy and terrorism.        
	In cutting remarks similar to the ones at the Asia Society, Krishna added: Pakistan cannot impart lessons to us on democracy and human rights. If, however, Pakistan were to live up to its commitment not to allow use of its soil by terrorists acting against India, this would significantly help reduce the trust deficit that impedes the development of better bilateral relations between our two countries.         
	Expressing genuine disappointment over Qureshis remarks and responding to his demand for a plebiscite in Kashmir under UN auspices, Krishna had argued yesterday that state elections that are held there every five years were a kind of plebiscite.         
	Nobody has ever questioned the elections in Kashmir as fake.         
	Like many Pakistani leaders before him, Qureshi appeared to have overplayed his hand in New York, mistaking Indias resilience for weakness and misjudging that New Delhis back was to the wall over the domestic situation in Kashmir.         
	Reporters and analysts here watching the two delegations had suspected all along that Qureshi did not come to New York with any sincere desire to have talks with Krishna.        
	Instead, his hopes were to wrest concessions directly from New Delhi by hoping to mount pressure on India on Kashmir at the UN, influential think tanks here, the international media, and most of all, the Barack Obama administration.         
	He raised Kashmir at every possible forum and vitiated the atmosphere to an extent where Krishna could not have sat down with him and held cordial talks.         
	Besides, unlike the Indian side, the Pakistanis did not bring their foreign secretary to New York. Unlike Sinha, who joined Krishnas delegation, Qureshis team did not include their point person for India.        
	Qureshis actions and demeanour suggested that the Pakistanis behaved in New York on an assessment that India would do anything and bend over backwards for a round of bilateral talks notwithstanding all the charges and criticism levelled against New Delhi on Kashmir.        
	But Krishna made it clear yesterday that neither he nor Prime Minister Manmohan Singh could be pushed around.        
	At the same time, Krishna is returning home tomorrow, leaving the door open for continuing the dialogue with Pakistan as desired by the Prime Minister. He repeatedly invoked Singhs vision of a peaceful and prosperous South Asia and the Prime Ministers hopes for peace with neighbours in his speeches here.         
	And in a clever diplomatic initiative after it became clear that the two foreign ministers would not meet here, Krishna last night said he would welcome Qureshi in New Delhi if he were to visit the city during the Commonwealth Games.        
	We will be delighted to have foreign ministers. And foreign minister Qureshi is most welcome to witness the games, and there again give us a chance to have, to continue the dialogue, Krishna said.        
	The proposal is seen as having enabled India to maintain the high ground on a rapprochement with Pakistan.         
	Krishna also said yesterday that his invitation to Qureshi, extended earlier, stood and that he would work through diplomatic channels to fix dates for such a visit.

          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Kokrajhar/Guwahati, April 13: The Hagrama Mohilary-led Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF) won the mandate to rule the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) for a second straight term of five years, having bagged 31 of the 40 seats in a landmark victory today.         
	Assam election commissioner Biren Dutta told The Telegraph in Guwahati that the Congress  which was engaged in a friendly fight with the BPF, its ally at Dispur, won three seats and Independents 6, including BPPF president Rabiram Narzary and UDPF (1). (Bodoland Peoples Progressive Front and UDPF candidates are treated as Independents as the parties are not recognised officially).        
	Mohilary said his party would form the council in alliance with the Congress and strive towards development. I congratulate the people for the victory. Our victory has proved peoples support to us. We will carry on the good work for the development of the region, he told reporters at the party office in Kokrajhar after the victory.         
	Mohilary won from Debargaon by a margin of 28,329 votes against BPPFs Subrah Narzary. He polled 32,433 votes while Narzary got 4,829 votes.        
	The president of the rival BPPF group, Rabiram Narzary, won from Porbotjhora by 1,859 votes. He polled 17,481 votes to defeat the BPFs Hemchandra Brahma who got 15,622 votes. He, however, lost Salakati, the other constituency that he had contested, to BPFs Derhasat Basumatary who won it by 16,574 votes.         
	Sources said Narzarys victory was a significant development as the BTC Legislative Assembly had been running without any Opposition candidate and there was no one to highlight irregularities. Moreover, the BPPF president might get the support of UDPF candidate Pradip K. Daimary who won from Bairabkhunda constituency. The Congress won three seats from Srirampur (Cristom Tudu), Nonai Serfang (Sontosh Kumar Kujur) and Pasnoi Serfang (Jitu Kisan).

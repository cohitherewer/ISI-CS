  - One Steve topples another										      MIGUEL HELFT AND ASHLEE VANCE                                                    Jobs; Ballmer in Delhi      
	San Francisco, May 27: Wall Street has called the end of an era and the beginning of the next one: the most important technology product no longer sits on your desk but rather fits in your hand.        
	The moment came on Wednesday when Apple, the maker of the iPod, iPhone and the iPad, shot past Microsoft, the software giant, to become the worlds most valuable technology company. The news also broke on a day Microsofts chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, was in New Delhi to tout cloud computing plans. (See Business)        
	This changing of the guard caps one of the most stunning turnarounds in business history for Apple, which had been given up for dead only a decade earlier, and its visionary chief executive, Steven P. Jobs.         
	The rapidly rising value attached to Apple by investors also heralds a cultural shift: consumer tastes have overtaken the needs of business as the leading force shaping technology.        
	Microsoft, with its Windows and Office software franchises, has dominated the relationship most people had with their computers for almost two decades, and that was reflected in its stock market capitalisation. But the click-clack of the keyboard has ceded ground to the swipe of a finger across a smartphones touch screen.        
	Apple is in the right place at the right time. Although it still sells computers, twice as much revenue is coming from hand-held devices and music. Overall, the technology industry sold about 172 million smartphones last year, compared with 306 million PCs, but smartphone sales grew at a pace five times faster.        
	Microsoft depends more on maintaining the status quo, while Apple is in a constant battle to one-up itself and create something new, said Peter A. Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal. Apple is a bet on technology, he said. And Apple beating Microsoft is a very significant thing.        
	As of Wednesday, Wall Street valued Apple at $222.12 billion and Microsoft at $219.18 billion. The only American company valued higher is Exxon Mobil, with a market capitalisation of $278.64 billion.        
	The companies have comparable revenue, with Microsoft at $58.4 billion and Apple at $42.9 billion. But in their most recent fiscal years, Apple had net income of $5.7 billion, while Microsoft earned $14.6 billion.        
	Microsoft has more cash and short-term investments, $39.7 billion, to Apples $23.1 billion, which makes the value assigned by the market to Apple, essentially a bet on its future prospects, all the more remarkable.        
	Ballmer, Microsofts chief executive, shrugged off the shift on Thursday morning. No technology company on the planet is more profitable than we are, he said in New Delhi. On any given day, the stock market is a voting machine, he said, and only in the long run is it weighing machine.        
	Apple declined to comment.        
	Apples climb to the top of the heap cements the reputation of Jobs, who once operated in the shadow of Microsofts co-founder, Bill Gates.        
	It is the single most important turnaround that I have seen in Silicon Valley, said Jim Breyer, a venture capitalist who has invested in some of the most successful technology companies.        
	While Apple is at the top of its game, it faces a new and powerful rival in Google, which is battling Apple in mobile devices with its Android operating system, and mobile advertising.        
	Google, with a market cap of $151.43 billion, also appeared to leap ahead of Apple in a new potentially important area, Internet-connected televisions.        
	 The battle has shifted from Microsoft against Apple to Apple against Google, said Tim Bajarin, a technology analyst. Apple has a significant lead. But Google is going to be a powerful competitor.        
	Apple and Microsoft initiated the personal computing revolution in the late 1970s, but Microsoft quickly outflanked Apple and grew to be one of the most profitable businesses ever created.        
	A little more than a decade ago, Apple, which had pushed out Jobs in 1985, was widely believed to be on the path to extinction.        
	Michael S. Dell, the founder and chief executive of Dell computer, went so far as to suggest that Apple should shut down and return any money to shareholders. (The computer maker is now worth about a tenth of Apple.)         
	Around the same time, Microsofts chief technology officer called Apple already dead.        
	But with the return of Jobs to Apple in 1996  and an investment by Microsoft of $150 million  the company began a slow path to recovery.         
	Apples rebirth began in earnest with the introduction of the iPod music players, and Jobs began to gain a reputation for anticipating what consumers want.         
	Jobs helped create the best desktop computer, the best portable music device, the best smartphone and also now the best tablet, said Steve Perlman, a serial entrepreneur who was an executive at both Apple and Microsoft.        
	As Apple grew increasingly nimble and innovative, Microsoft has struggled to build desirable updates to its main products and to create large new businesses.        
	Ballmer said that while Microsoft has some very good competitors, the company is a very good competitor itself. Yet Ballmer seemed to concede that Microsoft needs improvement in some areas.        
	Windows phone  boom! We have to deliver devices with our partners this Christmas, he said. Feedback so far has been good, he said, but the company still has a lot of work to do.        
	Still, Microsoft is a hugely powerful and profitable company in the tech world. Its Windows software runs 9 out of every 10 computers, while more than 500 million people use its Office software to perform their daily tasks, like writing letters or sending e-mail messages.        
	But Apple has the momentum. Steve saw way early on, and way before Microsoft, that hardware and software needed to be married into something that did not require effort from the user, said Scott G. McNealy, the co-founder and long-time chief executive of Sun Microsystems. Apples products are shrink-wrapped and ready to go.

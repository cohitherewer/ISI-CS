                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bengal ladies star in   dry train drama 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Brinda, Mamata                                
	New Delhi, April 20: Brinda Karat and Mamata Banerjee sparred in Parliament today with the CPM politburo member accusing the inhuman railways of running a train for the disabled without a drop of water and the Trinamul Congress chief screaming dont do this drama.        
	Karat abruptly intervened during a discussion in the Rajya Sabha over the railways plans for the future and need for more funds. A group of disabled people had to travel from Calcutta to Delhi on a special train that did not have a drop of water and ran 12 hours late, she said.        
	There is a very big demonstration of disabled people outside. The railway ministry charged them Rs 17 lakh (for the chartered travel). But there was not a drop of water on the train. We desperately tried to contact everybody. There was nobody available to help them. The train is 12 hours late. And now we are talking about Maha Duronto and what not! This is an inhuman situation.        
	Mamata would not let go after such a jab. She is misleading the House. She is distorting facts. Dont do this drama, she shot back.         
	Amid the din of Left and Trinamul MPs exchanging various charges, Karat, a Rajya Sabha member from Bengal, was heard repeating not a drop of waterand inhuman treatment.         
	Later, Mamata got her deputy, minister of state for railways E. Ahmed, to trash the allegations.         
	The train had a late start from Howrah partly because of late arrival The train was waiting at Mughal Sarai station because, as per the report that I have got, the ladies started taking bath in the toilets and the males came out of the coach and took bath in the open by using the water hydrants, he said.        
	The water apparently got exhausted because of the bathing.        
	Mamata, too, said the same in Hindi interspersed with English. Train aa rahi thi, aapne board karne me late ki. Phir aap raaste me nahai. Aapke nahane se sara paani khatm ho gaya aur train bhi late ho gayee, she said.

                                Walter                            
	Salt Lake City, Feb. 12 (AP): Walter Fredrick Morrison, the man credited with inventing the Frisbee, died at his home in Monroe, Utah.        
	His son, Walt, said yesterday that old age caught up with his father.        
	Morrison sold the manufacturing rights to his Pluto Platter in 1957. The flying disc was later renamed the Frisbee.

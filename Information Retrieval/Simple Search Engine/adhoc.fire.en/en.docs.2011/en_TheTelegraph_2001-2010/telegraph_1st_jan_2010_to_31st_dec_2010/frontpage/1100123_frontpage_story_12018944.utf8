  - Central employee wins fight against quarrelsome tag at tribunal, but not the hearts of his bosses          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                                     
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: The Argumentative Indian has no place in a government office, or, perhaps, any office.        
	Look at the travails of Arvind Prakash, a finance and accounts officer with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), whos paid for his arguments with a transfer  his ninth in nine years.        
	Prakash had moved the central administrative tribunal after being labelled argumentative and quarrelsome in his 2003-04 annual report card, which had, otherwise, found his performance to be satisfactory.        
	He won his quarrel, with the tribunal quashing his annual confidential report. But, as if to prove that all that the Argumentative Indian  the name of Amartya Sens book on the countrys argumentative tradition  deserved was an official swat, the council struck back with another transfer.        
	Arguments ought to be encouraged at a research organisation of all places, one would think, but from the ICARs reaction, it seems Prakash got on his bosses nerves.        
	Although marked satisfactory in analytical abilities and honest in the general assessment category, he was handed a memorandum that said he needed to be more positive and helpful in his work as an officer involved with scientific purchases.         
	The official was also asked to improve his human relationship skills.        
	Praveen Swarup, the counsel for his office, said that since joining in 2001, Prakash had had a long history of being argumentative and quarrelsome with fellow employees. This had led to frequent transfers to different institutes of the organisation.        
	The ICAR counsel, however, added that Prakash had never been issued any advice or caution notice.        
	The tribunal bench chaired by Dharam Pal Sharma said the confidential report was arbitrary and without any factual basis and had no connection with his area of work.        
	Furthermore, on the one hand his ability was adjudged as satisfactory and on the other, it is reported that he needs to be positive; he is said to be honest and a person with potential and simultaneously said to be lacking in (the skills for) human relationships. The two would not ordinarily stand together, Justice Sharma said.        
	Soon after the judgment, Prakash was transferred again  this time from Krishi Anusandhan Bhavan to the ICAR headquarters in Krishi Bhavan, about 10km away.        
	We dont know if hes carried his arguments there. But once an arguer, always an arguer. We all know that  every office usually has one.

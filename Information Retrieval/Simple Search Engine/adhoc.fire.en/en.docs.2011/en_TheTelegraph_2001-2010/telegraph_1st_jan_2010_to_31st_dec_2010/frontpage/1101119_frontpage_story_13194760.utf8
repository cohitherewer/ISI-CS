  - CM writes to railway minister to extend MoU, agree on 50:50 cost-sharing          AMIT GUPTA                                                 
	Ranchi, Nov. 18: Chief minister Arjun Munda has urged Union railway minister Mamata Banerjee to ensure early renewal of an MoU for six pending railway projects in Jharkhand being executed since 2002.         
	In his letter (dated November 11), he has also requested Mamata to agree on a cost-sharing of 50:50 for escalated estimates, which are result of the inordinate delay in execution of projects that were expected to be completed by 2007.         
	So far, the state and railways share had been 66.66 and 33.33 per cent, respectively, for the six projects cumulatively pegged at Rs 1,997 crore in 2002. Now, the cost has soared to Rs 3,292 crore.         
	The pending railway projects are Ranchi-Barkakana-Hazaribagh-Koderma (189km) line, Ranchi-Lohardaga-Tori (113km) line, Koderma-Tilaiya (14km) line, Koderma-Giridih (105km) line, Deoghar-Dumka (60km) line and Dumka-Rampurhat (64km) line. Laying of the total 545km tracks is expected to change the face of passenger and goods transportation via rail in the state.         
	The MoU for the projects expired way back in February 2007.         
	Despite several reminders in the past three years, the agreement was never extended though we continued to share costs incurred in the projects during the time, state transport commissioner Satendra Singh told The Telegraph.         
	Under the existing (66.66 per cent) cost-sharing agreement, the state government ought to pay Rs 1,332 crore. Of this amount, Rs 1,191 crore has already been given to the railways. It needs to give rest Rs 141 crore more based on old estimates. The state budget, however, provides an allocation of Rs 126 crore in the 2010-11 fiscal.        
	Railway figures available with the state government suggest that a sum of Rs 1,714.06 crore has already been spent on the projects. Now, the state wants a cost-sharing ratio of 50:50 for a major chunk of about Rs 1,300 crore, which will be required to complete the projects based on revised estimates.         
	Notably, the Deoghar-Dumka line is almost complete. Tracks linking work of only about half-a-kilometre is pending and is expected to be done by the end of this month. An inspection from the chief of railway security may also facilitate an NOC to start goods and passenger services in the segment in the near future.         
	The Ranchi-Lohardaga-Tori line is complete till Barkichapi. The Koderma-Tilaiya project is pending due to forest-related issues while work on the others are yet to pick up pace.         
	Reasons behind the delay in execution of the projects include problems like land acquisition and law and order, as a major portion of the tracks pass through Naxalite strongholds.

	New Delhi, Nov. 22: Manmohan Singh and B.S. Yeddyurappas paths crossed in Puttaparthi but it almost looked as though their stars were conjoined by a twist of fate.        
	The Prime Minister, under attack from the Opposition, and the Karnataka chief minister, fighting to save his chair, were in the Andhra town to attend a convocation at the Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning that Singh addressed.         
	Yeddyurappa, known as the BJPs most god-fearing person, used the occasion to seek the blessings of Sri Sathya Sai Baba who is based in Puttaparthi.        
	Unlike Yeddyurappa, Singh is not known to keep the company of spiritual advisers and is unlikely to have forgotten that celebrity astrologers had predicted his 2004 government would not last its term. The only time he visited Puttaparthi was in 1995 when he was gently prodded by his political mentor, P.V. Narasimha Rao, a Baba devotee.        
	When he heard that the Prime Minister would be in Puttaparthi, Yeddyurappas political instincts kicked into play. He requested the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) to let him hitch a ride on Singhs special aircraft to Delhi where his BJP bosses eagerly waited to hand him the pink slip.        
	The PMO obliged, while others wondered what signal Yeddyurappa was looking to beam to the BJP headquarters by being seen in the Prime Ministers entourage that also included Punjab governor Shivraj Patil.        
	Yeddyurappa didnt converse with the Prime Minister who was enclosed in a cabin with his family. But the chief ministers presence stumped the BJP leaders. You never know what hell do next, perhaps divert the plane to another destination and then disappear for a few hours, one of them said, referring to the wait-and-watch game unfolding over the past week.        
	In Delhi, BJP chief Nitin Gadkari authorised Rajya Sabha Opposition leader Arun Jaitley to coax a resignation letter out of Yeddyurappa.        
	Gadkari left for Nagpur tonight without meeting Yeddyurappa. A decision on Yeddyurappas immediate future will await his return on Tuesday.         
	Yeddyurappa, who arrived late in the evening with the Prime Minister, took his own time to call on Jaitley.        
	The chief minister went from the airport to Karnataka Bhavan where he was in a huddle with the states MPs.         
	His loyalists are trying to drum up support for him before the BJPs parliamentary party holds its routine meeting on Tuesday morning. Some MPs said they would question the leaders for not consulting them on the proposed leadership change.        
	Earlier in the day, Yeddyurappa had deputed MPs and MLAs loyal to him to plead his case.        
	Bangalore North MP Chandre Gowda, who said he had called on Gadkari and Jaitley, told The Telegraph: Law and order is very good, there is no failure of the constitutional machinery, and people outside Bangalore do not want him to be disturbed. I agree, he made mistakes. But his removal may entail a huge price.

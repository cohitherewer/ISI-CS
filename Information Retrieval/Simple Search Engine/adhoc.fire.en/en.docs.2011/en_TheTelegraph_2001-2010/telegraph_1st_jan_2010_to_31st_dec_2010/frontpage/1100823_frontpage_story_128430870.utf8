	New Delhi, Aug 23 (PTI): A mechanism to provide for speedy resolution of matters relating to disputes in institutions of higher education was cleared by the Union Cabinet here today.
    A meeting of the Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh gave its nod to the Educational Tribunals Bill 2010 which seeks to set up a two-tier structure of Educational Tribunals at the national and state level to adjudicate on the entire gamut of disputes that arise in the higher education system, sources said.
    The tribunals will act as forums for fast-track and speedy resolution of issues in institutions in order to build an effective system of checks and balances in higher education.
    The state tribunals will adjudicate matters concerning teachers, employees and students of institutions in the respective states.

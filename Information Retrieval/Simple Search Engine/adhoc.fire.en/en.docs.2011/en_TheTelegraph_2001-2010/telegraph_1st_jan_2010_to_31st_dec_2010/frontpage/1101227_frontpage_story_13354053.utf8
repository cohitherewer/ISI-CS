          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Shifting gear                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 26: Toyota Kirloskar Auto Parts (TKAP)  a joint venture of Toyota Motor Corporation, Toyota Industries and the Kirloskar group  will invest Rs 500 crore in an engine and transmission plant, which will cater to the Etios and the Liva.         
	This will help Toyota Kirloskar Motors (TKM) to increase the localisation level to 90 per cent from 70 per cent, said Koji Nagata, executive managing co-ordinator and director (marketing) of TKM.         
	The Etios, developed by Toyota for India, is being produced at TKMs second facility at Bidadi, near Bangalore, that has a capacity to manufacture 70,000 vehicles per year.         
	The domestic production of engines and transmission will enable us to provide the best quality product at a competitive price. India plays a vital role in Toyotas global expansion plans and this development marks another step towards the companys growth in India, Nagata said.         
	On whether higher localisation level will bring down the price of the Etios, which costs Rs 5.03 lakh (base model, ex-showroom, Calcutta), he said, Price points will be revisited according to the demand.         
	The engine facility is slated to be operational in 2012 followed by the transmission plant in 2013, he said, adding that the construction of the engine unit has already started.         
	The engine plant will have a capacity of 1 lakh units per year. On whether the facility is going to serve as a hub for the south Asian markets, Nagata said, For now, the plant will cater to domestic consumption.         
	The transmission facility will manufacture 2.4 lakh units per year.         
	The facilities will come up at Bidadi adjacent to the TKAP plant, which produces R-type transmissions for vehicles developed on Toyotas multipurpose vehicle platform that includes the Fortuner SUV and the Lux Vigo pick-up truck, which is marketed in Thailand. The R-type transmissions are exported to Toyota Worldwide. The current plant has a capacity of 1,70,000 units, Nagata said.

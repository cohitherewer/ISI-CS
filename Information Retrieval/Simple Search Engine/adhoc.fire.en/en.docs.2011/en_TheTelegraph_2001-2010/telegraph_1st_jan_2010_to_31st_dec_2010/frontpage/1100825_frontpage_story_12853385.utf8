          OUR BUREAU                            Narayana Murthy and Bhattacharjee at Lalbazar on Tuesday. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Infosys chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy was in town on Tuesday to inaugurate Calcuttas first cyber crime police station and a technologically upgraded control room at Lalbazar along with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.         
	Narayana Murthy said computers can gather data and transform them into information at rapid speed.         
	The computer makes people efficient, conquers distance and improves the quality of life. The new technology will definitely enhance the quality of crime detection in Calcutta, he said.        
	The tech guru spent over an hour at Lalbazar with Bhattacharjee, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, state IT minister Debesh Das and seniors officials.         
	He put forward a number of interesting questions to the officers. His suggestions will help Calcutta police, said Bhattacharjee.         
	Later, when asked if Infosys would invest in Bengal, Bhattacharjee smiled but remained tight-lipped. You will see, was his reply.         
	At the inauguration, the chief minister said the cyber crime police station was a big step towards providing the city with knowledge-based policing and sought the visionary Narayana Murthys invaluable guidance.         
	Ten city cops will be sent to the Mysore campus of Infosys for training in cyber crime policing, said an officer.         
	About the upgraded control room, an officer said: Traffic signal violations will be automatically recorded and we can keep vigil on important buildings.

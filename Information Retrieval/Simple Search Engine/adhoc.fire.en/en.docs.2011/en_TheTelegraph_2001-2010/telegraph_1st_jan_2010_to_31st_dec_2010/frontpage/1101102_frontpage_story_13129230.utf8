	Ranchi, Nov. 1: A three-member team of experts, headed by economist Bibek Debroy, began its job of mapping a growth path of politically unstable Jharkhand today by meeting chief minister Arjun Munda and discussing the contours of a state development report.        
	Working on a three-month time frame, Debroy, who was approached by Munda to take up the assignment, said his meeting with the chief minister was productive.        
	He has given us some thoughts to work upon, he told The Telegraph.        
	Debroy, a professor at Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi, and visiting honorary senior research fellow for Institute for South Asian Studies at National University of Singapore, said their job was to draw up a development model to improve the rate of growth, ensure people did not migrate out of the state, the benefits of growth were evenly distributed and, moreover, development was not perceived as something which hurt people.        
	Our focus will not be industry-chamber (of commerce) centred. Industrialisation is just a tool for development. We want increase in productivity of the people, and their access to health, jobs and education facilities, he pointed out.         
	Debroy clarified that the committee would talk to government officials as well as non-government organisations and members of civil society to get a feedback before coming out with recommendations.        
	Debroy, who has held several important posts in the past, including director, Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies at Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, consultant, department of economic affairs in the Union ministry of finance, said the state government was keen to have a vision document within three months.         
	The state prepares a development report but that is not in the public domain. I think it is the first initiative of the government to have a development report, he pointed out.        
	 The other two members of the committee are Lavees Bhandari, an economist by training and a director at Indicus Analytical, a Delhi-based economics research firm, and Vishal Singh, a management graduate from Oxford University.         
	We are confident the government will implement many of our recommendations, if not all, Debroy said, but refused to comment on the ills plaguing Jharkhand, saying they had to get a feedback first.         
	He, however, added that the major problem in Jharkhand was with administrative delivery. Our primary job is to think of sensible solutions and prescribe action points, he said.        
	 For, the nature of problem, he added, was the same everywhere. The answer has to be changed a little bit for every region, i.e.Chhotanagpur, Palamau, Santhal Pargana and Singhbhum.        
	Maintaining that Jharkhand should have done much better, Bhandari agreed that the state had a lot of potential.         
	The team, which will be here till Thursday, will visit Palamau, Singhbhum and Santhal Pargana in the next two months.

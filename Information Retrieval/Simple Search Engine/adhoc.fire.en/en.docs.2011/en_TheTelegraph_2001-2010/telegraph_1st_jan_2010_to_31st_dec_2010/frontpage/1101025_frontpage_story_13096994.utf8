The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Iran lures top Karzai aide with cash
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Iran lures top Karzai aide with cash
          DEXTER FILKINS                      Hamid Karzai                          
	Kabul, Oct. 24: One evening last August, as President Hamid Karzai wrapped up an official visit to Iran, his personal plane sat on the airport tarmac, waiting for a late-running passenger: Irans ambassador to Afghanistan.         
	The ambassador, Feda Hussein Maliki, finally appeared, taking a seat next to Umar Daudzai, Karzais chief of staff and his most trusted confidant. According to an Afghan official on the plane, Maliki handed Daudzai a large plastic bag bulging with packets of euro notes. A second Afghan official confirmed that Daudzai carried home a large bag of cash.         
	This is the Iranian money, said an Afghan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Many of us noticed this.         
	The bag of money is part of a secret, steady stream of Iranian cash intended to buy the loyalty of Daudzai and promote Irans interests in the presidential palace, according to Afghan and Western officials here. Iran uses its influence to help drive a wedge between the Afghans and their American and Nato benefactors, they say.         
	The payments, which officials say total millions of dollars, form an off-the-books fund that Daudzai and Karzai have used to pay Afghan lawmakers, tribal elders and even Taliban commanders to secure their loyalty, the officials said.         
	The Western and Afghan officials interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the delicacy of discussing the financial dealings of Karzai and his aide. The sources said they were motivated by a concern that Daudzai was helping to poison relations between Karzai and the US. Daudzai and Karzai both declined to respond to written questions about their relationship with Iran. An aide to Daudzai dismissed the allegations as rubbish.

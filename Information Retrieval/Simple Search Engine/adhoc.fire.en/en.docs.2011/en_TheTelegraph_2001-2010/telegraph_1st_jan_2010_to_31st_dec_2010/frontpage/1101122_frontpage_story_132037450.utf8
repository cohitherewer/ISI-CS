                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                India 510 for five at tea against NZ
										      
	Nagpur, Nov 22 (PTI): India were 510 for five in their first innings at tea on the third day of the third and final Test against New Zealand here today. India lead New Zealand by 317 runs.  
	Rahul Dravid notched up his 31st Test century while captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni smashed his way to an unbeaten 95 as India reached a mammoth 510 for five at tea, final Test match against New Zealand here today.
    With a huge lead of 317, Dhoni and company will definitely try to go for the kill with two days still to go in the match.
    Dravid (166 batting, 364 balls, 18x4), who has had an indifferent time before the start of this Test series now has two centuries to show for his effort having scored another in the first Test at Ahmebabad.
    However, it was not one of his smoothest of efforts as it was more about patience and intense concentration.
    Brief Score:
    New Zealand 1st Innings: 193 all out
    India 1st Innings: 386/5 in 115 overs (Rahul Dravid 166 batting, Mahendra Singh Dhoni 95 batting, Sachin Tendulkar 61; Daniel Vettori 2/155).

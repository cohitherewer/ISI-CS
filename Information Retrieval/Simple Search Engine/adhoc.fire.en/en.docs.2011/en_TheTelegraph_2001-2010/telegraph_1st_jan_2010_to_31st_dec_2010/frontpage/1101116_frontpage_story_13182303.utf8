          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Ratan Tata being greeted by former Uttarakhand chief minister N.D. Tiwari   in Dehra Dun on Monday. (PTI)        
	Mumbai, Nov. 15: Ratan Tata today said he had grounded plans to float a domestic airline because of a suggestion by a fellow industrialist to pay a bribe of Rs 15 crore to a minister to secure approvals.        
	I happened to be on a flight once. A fellow industrialist sitting next to me said: You know, I dont understand; you people are very stupid. You know that the minister wants Rs 15 crore. Why dont you just pay? You want the airlines. I said you will never understand this; I just want to go to bed at night knowing that I havent got the airline by paying for it, Tata said while recounting the incident to reporters in Dehra Dun today.        
	The Tata group chieftains comment brought into sharp focus a 13-year-old episode in which Bombay House -- the headquarters of the Tata group -- was thwarted while attempting to claw its way back into the aviation business that the group had pioneered in the country in 1932 has never been fully .        
	Tata did not disclose the identity of the industrialist or the minister in question.        
	Late in the evening, the Tata public relations issued a clarification stating that no minister (had) ever asked Mr Tata for a bribe.        
	In a statement, the group said: The fellow industrialist (had) expressed his personal viewpoint that some minister was asking for a bribe. Mr Tata was in no way in agreement to the fact that he had been asked to pay a bribe by any minister.        
	But the clarification did little to stop the buzz of speculation over the identity of the minister or the government that he represented.        
	One theory doing the rounds is that Tata was referring to the way that his plan -- originally floated in 1995 -- was scuttled during the H.D. Deve Gowda government.         
	In 1997, then civil aviation minister C.M. Ibrahim had refused to clear the Tata-SIA plan on the ground that the rules did not allow the participation of a foreign airline in the aviation sector. The Tata plan, however, had the support of then industry minister Murasoli Maran.         
	The Tatas had managed to secure approvals from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) for a Rs 2,800-crore project to create an airline with 88 planes -- which would have made it the largest in Indian skies.        
	Ibrahim had piloted a civil aviation policy through the cabinet in April 1997 -- virtually in his last days as minister in the Deve Gowda government -- that barred any foreign airline or airport authority from entering the domestic aviation sector, effectively nixing the Tata plan.        
	Late tonight, Ibrahim challenged Tata to name the minister. He has not named (the minister). I insist upon it and I am writing to the Prime Minister. Let the PM conduct a CBI inquiry, Ibrahim told a television channel.        
	Later on another channel, he said: It is left to him (Tata) whether he wanted to name the minister. I had told Ratan Tataji that you can come on your own but do not bring any foreign collaborator. With that policy, I have saved thousands of crores to the country, Ibrahim said.        
	Patriarch JRD Tata -- the first Indian to qualify as a pilot -- flew the inaugural flight of Tata Airlines from Karachi to Bombay on October 15, 1932. Later, in 1948, the airline became a joint sector venture -- under the name Air India International -- before it was eventually nationalised in 1953.        
	The move to nationalise the airline had upset JRD Tata, who at that time was the chairman of the airline. It will be a wrench for me to see the end of Air India as a valued part of the House of the Tatas, JRD had written in a letter to the traffic manager of the airline in April that year.        
	In 1992, the Congress government under P.V. Narasimha Rao adopted an open-sky policy and permitted private airlines to start operations in the country. The first licences were handed down to Naresh Goyal of Jet Airways, Takiyuddin Wahid of East West Airlines and Pervez Damania of Damania Airlines. Of them, only Jet Airways is still operating as a scheduled airline.        
	By 1996, several other players, including the Tatas, were seeking licences to start their airlines. The Tatas had roped in Singapore International Airlines (SIA) as its partner to create a world-class airline, sparking fear among the existing players, including the state-owned Indian Airlines.        
	In 2000, the group once again tried to enter the aviation sector by partnering with Singapore Airlines to bid for a 40 per cent stake in national carrier Air India. This plan also came to naught. In 2001, Singapore Airlines dropped out of the race for Air India as it faced political opposition.         
	A statement issued by Singapore Airline in September 2001 said it was surprised by the intensity of opposition to the privatisation of Air India. In such an adverse climate, Singapore Airlines is not confident that it can play a useful and effective role, the statement added.

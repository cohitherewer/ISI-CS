          OUR BUREAU                              
	Raipur/New Delhi, Dec. 24: Chhattisgarh-based rights activist Binayak Sen was today convicted of colluding with Maoists to fight the state and handed a life term in a judgment condemned by rights bodies as a blow to Indian democracy.        
	The Raipur court also awarded life sentences to the 58-year-old paediatricians co-accused  CPI (Maoist) leader Narayan Sanyal, 80, and Calcutta-based businessmen Piyush Guha, 30  declaring all three guilty of sedition and conspiracy.        
	Sen, a public health specialist who has received many awards for his three-decade-long work among Chhattisgarhs impoverished tribals, was arrested in Bilaspur on May 14, 2007. He was charged with passing messages and letters from the imprisoned Sanyal to Guha and other alleged Maoists.        
	Former Delhi High Court Chief Justice Rajinder Sachar said the Peoples Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), of which Sen was national vice-president, would challenge the verdict as well as the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act under which Sen was found guilty. Sachar described the UAP Act as unconstitutional.        
	Sens younger brother Dipankar broke down after the verdict. Sens wife Ilina sat down on the courts stairs in disbelief and said: There is no evidence against him. We will go to the high court.        
	Rights activists said Sen had been victimised for exposing the atrocities committed on tribals by the Salwa Judum, the anti-Maoist vigilante group formed by the Chhattisgarh government.        
	In June 2007, US thinker Noam Chomsky and 22 Nobel laureates had appealed to the Centre to free Sen, saying his imprisonment was an attempt to intimidate... democratic voices... speaking out against human rights violations in the state. But Sen, a heart patient, had to wait two years for bail, which was granted by the Supreme Court in May 2009. In 2008, he spent a month in solitary confinement.        
	Sen had been arrested after Guha was picked up on May 6, 2007, from Raipur railway station. The police claimed Guha was carrying three letters from Sanyal that Sen had passed on to him.        
	After his conviction, he was taken into police custody. The sentence was pronounced in the afternoon.

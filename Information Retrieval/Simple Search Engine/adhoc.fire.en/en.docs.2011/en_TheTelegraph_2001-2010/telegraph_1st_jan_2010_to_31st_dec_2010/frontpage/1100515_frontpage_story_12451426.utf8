  - Gadkari holds late night discussions with Rajnath, Advani; plans to meet Bhagwat in Nagpur today        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                    
	New Delhi, May 14: The RSS is expected to finally step in and sort out the BJPs sticking points that have thwarted a resolution to the Jharkhand impasse, a final decision on which is likely by Saturday or Sunday.        
	BJP president Nitin Gadkari will be in Nagpur  the RSSs headquarters  on Saturday and will meet sarsanghachalak Mohanrao Bhagwat and his aides to thrash out the problems. It will be communicated to New Delhi after which a formal announcement is likely.        
	The BJP president was back in New Delhi late this evening from a three-day visit in Punjab and went into a meeting of party general secretaries to sort out organisational matters. Late tonight, he held a meeting with Rajnath Singh and L.K. Advani on the Jharkhand impasse.        
	Gadkari was spending his last few hours in New Delhi because after his Nagpur stopover he would proceed to Mumbai and fly to Europe on a vacation. He will be back on May 27.         
	But if the RSS made up its mind and by implication the BJPs, the announcement could be made by Rajnath or another central leader.        
	Among the outstanding issues were Advani and Sushma Swarajs opposition to the JMMs demand for a 28-28 arrangement that essentially entailed sharing the chief ministers post for those many months between the BJP and the JMM.         
	Since other leaders were inclined to accepting the formula, the RSS might decide to disregard Advani and Sushmas objections and go with the majority view.        
	This apart, the JMM hasnt complied with any of the BJPs primary demands. Soren and Co is yet to issue a comprehensive letter of support to a BJP-led government. The letter would have to be signed by all its 18 MLAs so that the BJP was certain there was no split in the party.        
	The BJP also sought Shibu Sorens resignation letter simultaneously. So far, there has been no sign of that.         
	Lastly, the BJP, too, hasnt been able to firm up its chief ministerial candidate.        
	Arjun Munda, the projected front-runner, is camping in New Delhi, having enlisted the patronage of a Mumbai-based corporate house with mining interests in Jharkhand. Friends of this industrial house, it is reliably learnt, have been meeting MLAs and some central leaders to push for Munda, a former chief minister and now MP from Jamshedpur.         
	Munda, who refused to take calls today, is backed by Rajnath Singh, M.Venkaiah Naidu and Ananth Kumar.         
	To scuttle Mundas chances, a couple of central leaders opposed to Rajnath, floated former Union minister Yashwant Sinhas candidacy, resting their case on the point that Jharkhand needed good governance and he had the experience and skills for providing it.        
	Sinha, who hasnt been on the best of terms with any of those leaders, was baffled when his name cropped up and has since made himself incommunicado for fear of falling foul of the RSS that might suspect him of leveraging his perceived image.        
	Gadkari and BJP general secretary in charge of the organisation Ramlal have favoured the deputy chief minister Raghubar Das. Their clout with the Sangh  Ramlal is the designated pointsperson dealing with the RSS  might boost Dass chances but for the fact he was a non-tribal.

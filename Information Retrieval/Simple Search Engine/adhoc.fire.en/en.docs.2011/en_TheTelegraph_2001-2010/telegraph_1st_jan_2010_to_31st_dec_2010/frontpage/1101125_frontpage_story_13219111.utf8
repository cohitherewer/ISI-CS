The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rabri loses seats, gains peace
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rabri loses seats, gains peace

	Patna, Nov. 24: Exit, Rabri Devi the reluctant politician. Re-enter, Rabri Devi the full-time homemaker.        
	Defeat in both Raghopur and Sonepur may have finally pushed the former Bihar chief minister and leader of the Opposition back to where she feels most comfortable: her kitchen.         
	Rabri Devi, dragged into politics following the arrest of Lalu Prasad in the Rs 950-crore fodder scam in 1997, has at best been a shadow of her husband throughout her political career. Even when she was chief minister, there was little to suggest that she preferred to be anything other than a wife to Lalu Prasad and mother to their nine children.         
	That she allegedly did not bother visiting her constituency Raghopur even once during the past five years was proof as much of her lack of interest in politics as of the Rashtriya Janata Dals complacency.        
	She was conspicuous by her absence in the Assembly even in July, when the House was convened for the last time before the elections.                   Rabri Devi with family members at her residence in Patna on Tuesday. (PTI)      
	But while Rabri Devi could even be feeling unburdened now, RJD supporters who had tried everything they could to ensure her victory seem unable to digest her losing both in Raghopur and Sonepur.        
	She did seem to have an emotional connect with female voters in both constituencies, but it didnt translate into votes. The Muslim-Yadav factor did not work either. Her defeat in both seats is unbelievable, said Santosh Kumar, an RJD supporter.         
	Although Rabri Devi had represented Raghopur in the Assembly thrice before, the RJD apparently decided to field her in Sonepur as well after negative reports from her home constituency. The buzz before the polls was that even the RJD faithful in Raghopur were somewhat disillusioned with her, although not even the partys rivals could see such a big defeat coming.        
	Rabri Devis defeat is a huge setback to the RJD, bigger than being routed by the ruling JD(U)-BJP alliance, said Prem Kumar, a BJP supporter.

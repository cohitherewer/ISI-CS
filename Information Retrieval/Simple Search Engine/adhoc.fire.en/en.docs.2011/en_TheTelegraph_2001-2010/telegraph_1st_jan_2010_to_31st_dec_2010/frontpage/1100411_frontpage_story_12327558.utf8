	Dibrugarh, April 10: Over 50 people, including students, were injured when police caned a mob that was protesting the death of a Class X student in a hit-and-run case this morning. The condition of four students injured in the police action was said to be critical.        
	Rubul Das, 15, a Class X student of St Marys School, Dibrugarh, was on his way to school on his bicycle around 6.50 this morning when he was crushed by a speeding dumper (registration number AS06A-7745) at Gabharupathar tri-junction in the heart of this town. Rubul, a local boy, had set out early to attend a private tuition and was run over just 400 metres from his school. He died on the spot. A case has been registered at Dibrugarh Sadar police station.        
	The tri-junction witnesses a major traffic flow during the morning and evening hours with numerous schools, a railway workshop and the AMCH located in and around the area.         
	A crowd gathered soon after and blocked the tri-junction. What agitated the people more was that the driver of the vehicle sped away after killing the student. Some of them tried to give a chase but failed to catch up, Prabir Dey, a local tailor, said.         
	The incident took place almost in front of Gabharupathar police outpost, which immediately informed Lahowal police who intercepted the vehicle in their area, 11km from the accident spot.         
	The driver, Upendra Kosua, was arrested and the vehicle seized.         
	In the meantime, angry residents and students of various schools, who had blocked the tri-junction, refused to withdraw the blockade despite a heavy downpour.        
	Sensing trouble, the Dibrugarh district administration sent magistrate Sarangapani Sarmah and a huge contingent of police and CRPF personnel, led by additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Debasish Sarmah, and additional superintendent of police (security) Raj Mohan Roy, to the spot.         
	We had to use force when the protesters refused to clear the area and started throwing stones at the security forces. Some of our policemen were also injured in the incident, Sarmah said.        
	Four students, including a Class X youth, Jafsin Ahmed, also of St Marys School, Dibrugarh, were injured critically in the police action.         
	They were admitted to the Assam Medical College and Hospital here. Around 50 other students and people, including the secretary of the All Assam Muttock Yuba Chatra Sanmelan, Mintu Borpatra, and the vice-president of the Jatiyatabadi Yuba Parishad, Assam, Udayan Gogoi, were injured.        
	Various organisations criticised the district administration and the police for the baton charge on students and demanded a high-level inquiry into the incident. The students were just organising the protest in a democratic way. Nobody hurled stones on the security forces, Borpatra said.

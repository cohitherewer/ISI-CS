          SANJAY K. JHA                                       
	New Delhi, April 27: The UPA government today easily defeated the cut motions but the wide margin masked the extent of its dependence on Mayavati who offered support in public hours before the trial of strength in the Lok Sabha.        
	The Oppositions disarray was in evidence with the cut motions garnering only 201 votes in favour and the government polling 289. Shibu Soren, who runs the Jharkhand government with the BJPs support, broke ranks and voted for the government.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party and Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal, which together account for 26 MPs, implicitly helped the government by walking out, saying they did not want to help communal forces. Mayavati cited the same reason to offer support to the UPA but other political calculations were behind the move.        
	But the governments cushion is not as comfortable as it appears from the cut-motion vote. The UPA tally of 289 is only 17 votes above the half-way mark of 272, which means the government could have been in trouble without the support of Mayavatis 21 MPs if all its rivals had voted together.        
	This suggests the government is precariously placed in terms of numbers, although the Opposition is not in a position to sew up an alternative primarily because of the antipathy some parties have towards the BJP.         
	Although the success in persuading the SP and the RJD to break away from the BJP-Left strategy is being seen as a significant achievement by Congress managers, many senior leaders, including a few ministers, privately expressed concern at the tally.        
	A cabinet minister said: The BSP has 21 members and they voted for us. That means we had less than 272 on our own and that is a cause for concern. It is as close as it can get.         
	Sources said the UPA, which has 271 members after the exit of Deve Gowdas JD-S which was absent today, polled 268 votes as three members  one each from Trinamul, NCP and the Congress  could not reach Delhi.         
	The Congress managers had expected nine members from smaller parties, including Jaswant Singh, to vote against the cut motions but that didnt happen. Many in the party initially thought it was not wise to strike a deal with the BSP as that would attract charges of a quid pro quo but it turned out that the governments majority would have come in doubt without Mayavatis support.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee was visibly elated after the outcome and described it as impressive approval. Several other Congress leaders, too, were satisfied as they thought breaking the much-hyped Opposition unity was not a mean achievement.        
	One Congress leader said: They almost held the nation hostage for over a month by threatening cut motions and tried to inject a sense of instability. Now we have a wonderful spectacle of the BJP and the Left standing together in one group and the rest of the Opposition lying scattered.         
	Sources said Congress leaders found the obstinacy of the BJP and the Left disturbing as this was the first time in the history of independent India that the Opposition had insisted on a division on cut motions.         
	Passing the demands for grants is a constitutional requirement and the BJP-Left tried to block that. It is a shame for Indian democracy. We should be deeply concerned about the future of democracy if such a confrontational attitude is shown by the Opposition parties, a senior minister said.         
	The parliamentary precedent so far has been that the cut motions on demands which are to be guillotined are not allowed to be moved. But Speaker Meira Kumar said no rule barred cut motions from being moved.         
	The Speakers contention that the constitutional rights of a member are more important than norms was welcomed by both the government and the Opposition. But the government felt that the Opposition had behaved irresponsibly in this matter. The Parliament secretariat cut a sorry figure as the electronic voting system collapsed, compelling the Speaker to fall back on slips. All the cut motions moved by members of the BJP, JD-U, Akali Dal, BJD, CPI, CPM, ADMK and the TDP were rejected by voice vote after one division by slips.        
	Many foreign dignitaries who had come to the visitors gallery to watch the voting left midway as the electronic system failed.         
	During the vote, most Congress managers were running to members to explain the voting system.        
	Mukherjee was the centre of attraction and even Sonia Gandhi took a keen interest. Allies Mamata Banerjee and Sharad Pawar were actively engaged in floor management.         
	Amid the din and bustle, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sat unperturbed, betraying no emotion. He didnt have to vote either, as he is a member of the Rajya Sabha.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tied to India before the knot
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tied to India before the knot
  - Passport taken, Shoaib to stay on          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                                    
	Hyderabad, April 5: Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik, Sania Mirzas husband-in-waiting, today declared he would leave India only after clearing his name in the murky saga of his alleged phone wedding with Ayesha, the city girl who claims her given name is Maha Siddiqui.        
	Police have ensured the former Pakistan captain cannot leave India by taking away his passport this morning following a complaint filed by Ayesha.         
	Sania by his side, Shoaib made an appearance in front of his fiances upscale Jubilee Hills bungalow for the second time since he set foot on Hyderabad last week, ahead of the proposed wedding on April 15, a date the tennis ace said still stood.         
	Shoaib, 28, said he would leave India only after the wedding and the police investigations were over.         
	Im here for the marriage and to clear my name. Im not leaving the country. Inshallah, Ill clear my name, Shoaib said.              
	I have no objections (to police taking the passport) and Im cooperating with the police and (the) Indian government. I have got respect for the authorities and I will do everything to clear my name. Im ready to face any type of questions. Ill get my passport in the evening, Shoaib added.        
	The police, however, said the passport would be returned after inquiries were over.        
	Following a complaint by Ayesha, the police have lodged an FIR under IPC sections 498-A (cruelty and dowry harassment), 420 (cheating and dishonesty) and 506 (criminal intimidation). If proved guilty, Shoaib could be jailed for seven to 12 years.        
	The city was abuzz with speculation that Shoaib could be arrested anytime after a police team visited the Mirza residence and questioned the cricketer for over an hour. The team then went to Ayeshas home in Banjara Hills and quizzed her for a similar duration. The police went back to her residence again in the afternoon for more documents.         
	At the news meet, Shoaib reiterated he had never met Ayesha but only the person known as Maha apa (elder sister) during his several visits to Hyderabad since 2002.         
	I have not done anything wrong. I will not apologise to Ayesha. I repeat that I have met Maha apa 20 times but never Ayesha. I want the media to leave the issue to the courts and the police.        
	The cricketer dared Ayesha to make a public appearance. Why is Ayesha making all these statements now and why cant she come before the camera and disclose her identity? Shoaib asked.        
	Everyone will know the age difference between us when they see her and surmise how could our wedding take place in 2002 and with whom?        
	Shoaib, however, admitted that his signature on the nikaahnama released by the Siddiquis was genuine. It is my signature, he said, but added that he had been cheated. Better leave the issue to the courts, he added.        
	The controversy revolves around the issue of the telephone nikaah between Ayesha and Shoaib on June 3, 2002. The cricketer said that to this day he had not met the girl whose photographs were sent to him by the Siddiqui family, who claimed they were of Ayesha. You can also ask Reema and Mona, both from Hyderabad, who are known to me and also Ayesha and Maha apa, he said.         
	A bleary-eyed Sania kept up a brave face. There is no question of any postponement of my wedding with Shoaib. Our wedding will take place on April 15. We are keen that Shoaib clears his name.         
	Sania said she was not favouring an out-of-court settlement, either. Let the truth come out. After all, it is my (future) husbands good name that is being sullied by this woman, she said.        
	Ayesha, in her complaint, has claimed that Shoaib has sent her an intimidating SMS threatening her with dire consequences and also offered her a bribe of Rs 5 crore to withdraw the complaint.         
	He said he had placed hitmen all along the road of her home in (the) right place to eliminate me and my family, she said in a televised audio interview later in the day.        
	Pak help        
	Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said the government would extend all assistance to Shoaib, whom he described as one of our renowned players.        
	I have asked the high commissioner to India to contact Indias foreign ministry and get information about the nature of the FIR and what is in it, Qureshi said in Islamabad.        
	Till this evening, the Pakistan mission in Delhi had not contacted the Indian government on the matter.

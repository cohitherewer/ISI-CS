          A STAFF REPORTER                     Tarun Gogoi                          
	Guwahati, April 1: Dispur today announced plans to set up an elementary education council to mark the coming into effect of the revolutionary legislation that provides for free and compulsory education to children in the age group of six to 14.        
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi made the announcement to reaffirm Dispurs commitment to implement the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, which came into effect from today across the nation, except in Jammu and Kashmir.         
	Under the legislation, states and local bodies are obliged to ensure that children between 6 and 14 get the benefits of education as envisaged under the law.         
	Gogoi did not give details of the proposed council, except that it would focus exclusively on improving the elementary education sector so that our educational base became strong.         
	CMO sources, however, said the council would be over and above the state advisory council to be set up according to the act. The proposed council/commission would be something similar to that of the Assam Higher Secondary Education Council that looks exclusively after Plus II level in the state, they said.         
	Recalling how he had touched upon the issue of free education in the seventies, Gogoi said, Our responsibility has increased manifold from today. Education has become a fundamental right today. It is a revolutionary step. I am pleased to say that my government has been according top priority to education and health since taking over in 2001. I am also particularly happy to share with you all that I had raised on the issue, including 25 per cent reservation for meritorious but poor students in private schools, during my first speech in Parliament on June 30, 1971.         
	In his speech, a copy of which was made available by the CMO, Gogoi stated: There are also thousands of children who do not have shelter and food, and do not get adequate education and other help. It is the duty of the government to see to it that all children get due care and protection. The children are the assets and future of our country and it is their fundamental right to get food and shelter and proper education.         
	Implementing the law will be easier said than done, the government admitted. Therefore, it will soon begin mapping existing infrastructure.         
	According to norms, there has to be a lower primary school every 1km and an upper primary school every 3km, among others.         
	Government estimates suggested that it would require Rs 4,000 crore in the next five years, over 20,700 lower primary, 5,000 upper primary teachers, 40,000 additional classrooms, 30,500 girls toilets and 20,000 general toilets to reach the intended target.         
	Of the estimated population of 60 lakh children in the 6-14 age group in the state, nearly 60,000 are out of school.         
	Gogoi appealed to all sections of society to help make the right to education, as well as Census 2011, which got under way today in the state, a success. It is important that everyone co-operates with the enumerators as this would help us plan better for the future. I have also asked districts bordering Bangladesh to be extra cautious while carrying out the massive census exercise given the problem of influx there, he said.

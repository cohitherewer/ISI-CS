The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dance baby dance: Sheila steps on Munni toes
                                                                                                                                                                           Dance baby dance: Sheila steps on Munni toes
          POULOMI BANERJEE                            Katrina Kaif in Sheila ki jawani from Tees Maar Khan                                  
	Saloni Agarwal was all set with the sangeet preparations for her friends wedding. We were ready with a medley of shaadi and masti songs and Munni badnaam hui was, of course, our show-stealer, said the fashion student.         
	Then she saw Katrina Kaif gyrating to Sheila ki jawani in the Tees Maar Khan promos and her best-laid plans fell apart. We just had to have that track in the sangeet. The dance CD had to be re-recorded, we had to stay up nights to match steps and even our costumes had to be reworked. But the blast we had with Sheila ki jawani was worth the last-minute changes, smiled Saloni.         
	Move over Munni, Sheila is here to steal your crown.        
	Bold and racy, the Vishal-Shekhar track seems to have caught the fancy of the city getting into festive mood.        
	If naughty Munni (of the Salman Khan superhit Dabangg) saw women break into jhatkas and matkas at plexes and parties, Sheila from Farah Khans December 24 release is getting the ladies to shake it like never before.        
	DJs agree that the song in Sunidhi Chauhans husky voice is almost a rage. Sheila ki jawani has just hit the popularity charts and I think it will become a bigger hit once the movie releases, says DJ Harish, who is playing the track at every private party. And hes betting big on Sheila keeping Calcutta on its toes through the last weeks of the year.        
	I think Sheila will be one of the hit tracks at year-end parties. And its a great wedding track too. More than the sangeet, which is a family affair, I think Sheila ki jawani is perfect for a bachelors party, says the DJ.        
	Bachelors bash or not, the women love Sheila... too, what with lyrics (by Vishal Dadlani) like Im too sexy for you/ main tere haath na aani (you wont get me).        
	Chandan Verma, who choreographs wedding functions, is all praise for Sheila... Some conservative families dont want Munni for the sangeet but have no such qualms about Sheila.... I have included the song in at least four sangeets, he says.        
	We hardly play originals. DJs always do their own mix. Munni... has a higher pitch so it is easier to mix, points out DJ Vishal of Tantra. Sheila... has a very urban feel whereas Munni... is more folk. Both are here to stay, adds DJ Girish D of Shisha Reincarnated.        
	Quirky lyrics and catchy beats aside, the songs USP is Katrina. Thats definitely a huge positive for the song. Even if it is a little raunchy, no one minds the lyrics and moves just because it has Katrina, smiles Harish.        
	People are writing about the track on Facebook and Twitter. I have started playing it on weekends and it has really caught on. It is the main track now, as popular as Munni..., says DJ Kunal of Venom.        
	Agrees DJ Girish D of Shisha. I am getting requests for it every night.        
	But with Munni... still going strong in the nightclub circuit, it remains to be seen whether the almost-Khan bahu nudges the long-time Khan bahu as the No. 1 scorcher on the dance floor.         
	Malaika Arora Khans Munni... will continue to do well in the year-end parties, but Katrinas Sheila... will be one of the top five tracks, predicts Harish.

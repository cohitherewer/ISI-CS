          SATISH NANDGAONKAR AND TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                                        Fahim Ansari      
	May 3: The acquittal of the two Indians may offer solace to those troubled by suggestions of a home-grown factor in the 26/11 attacks but the prosecution and Mumbai police stood shamed in the court today on this count.        
	The special court tore into the case against Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed, who were fished out of a prison in Uttar Pradesh and paraded as a big catch by the crime branch in the immediate aftermath of the 26/11 attacks.        
	The most embarrassing and damning  observation came when the court referred to a map allegedly drawn by Mumbai resident Fahim and handed over to Lashkar-e-Toiba handlers by Bihar-born Sabauddin.        
	Judge M.L. Tahaliyani said the prosecution had submitted that the map was recovered from the right pocket of the trousers of Abu Ismail, the Ajmal Kasab associate gunned down in an encounter at Girgaum Chowpatty on the night of 26/11.         
	I have examined the trouser. There was a cut in the pocket, but the map was intact. They (the gunmen) have travelled for days (by sea), but the map was in good condition and no wrinkles were seen. Moreover, the pocket had blood all over it, but no stain was seen on the map, the judge said, terming the claims highly doubtful.         
	Pointing out that the Pakistani gunmen and their handlers had used sophisticated equipment and sources like GPS, VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol phone) and Google Earth to plan the conspiracy, the judge wondered why they would use hand-drawn maps to identify the targets.        
	When such advanced technology is available, why should (hand-drawn) map be used? Google and Wikimapia give excellent print of maps, the judge said.         
	He also rejected the prosecution claim that Kasab and Ismail had originally planned to travel from the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) to Malabar Hill, which houses the bungalows of the chief minister and other ministers.        
	The map theory does not fit into the scheme. They were never destined to go towards Girgaum Chowpatty. They were asked to stay inside CST, but took the foot overbridge towards Cama Hospital, the judge said.        
	He gave Fahim and Sabauddin the benefit of doubt and acquitted them.        
	Fahim and Sabauddin are not out of the woods yet: the case for which they were originally arrested  an attack on a CRPF camp in Uttar Pradeshs Rampur in 2007 in which eight people were killed  is still pending in Lucknow. Sabauddin is also linked to an attack on the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore in 2005.        
	Uttar Pradesh police insisted tonight they had clinching evidence against the two in the CRPF camp case.        
	Judge Tahaliyani today punched more holes into the credibility of the evidence against the two in the Mumbai case.              
	Prosecution evidence against Ansari and Ahmed is unreliable... your evidence falls short and cannot be accepted, Tahaliyani said.        
	Deposing as a prosecution witness, Naruddin Mehboob Shaikh, a Goregaon resident, had identified Fahim as his childhood friend who lived in the same locality. He had also identified Sabauddin as Fahims friend whom the witness had met in Kathmandu at the house of one Bharat Thakur. The witness said he had seen Fahim hand over to Sabauddin a paper that looked like a map.        
	Rejecting Naruddins testimony, Tahaliyani said: He is a witness who is neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable.         
	The judge said the police could prove neither that the witness had visited Nepal nor that a map was handed to Sabauddin. Naruddin said he saw Fahim hand over a paper which looked like a map, the judge said. The police also did not produce Bharat Thakur before the court, though it may not have been difficult to do so.         
	The court also rejected the police claim that Fahim had enrolled in a computer course at an academy near the Bombay Stock Exchange. Two counterfoils of receipts from the computer institute were shown to the court. There was no book or register produced to prove that he had enrolled for the course, the court said.         
	The judge also appeared unconvinced by another claim that Fahim had rented a flat owned by a Bhosale family at Badhwar Park, the area where the Pakistani gunmen first landed in an inflatable dinghy on the night of 26/11. The Bhosales have deposed before me but both the witnesses have failed to inspire confidence, the judge said.         
	The court pointed out that the prosecution had not produced a reliable copy of the agreement Fahim is alleged to have signed with Bhosale after paying Rs 60,000 as deposit. Neither did the police produce the real estate agent who had allegedly arranged the accommodation.        
	Although the judge did not refer to David Headleys confession before a Chicago court that he had conducted the recce of the 26/11 targets, the development had weakened the prosecution case against Fahim and Sabauddin.         
	Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam appeared stunned by the acquittals but tried to put up a brave front outside the court.         
	It is not a complete acquittal, but they were given the benefit of doubt by the court. But I will recommend to the government to file an appeal against the acquittal. Whatever circumstances the court has not accepted, we will produce more evidence to prove the conspiracy charges, Nikam said.

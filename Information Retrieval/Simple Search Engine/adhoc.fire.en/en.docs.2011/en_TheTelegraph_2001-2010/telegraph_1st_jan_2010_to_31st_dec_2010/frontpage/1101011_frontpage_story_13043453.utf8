	Guwahati, Oct. 10: Twenty-one essential commodities will find space in Assams fair price shops besides the usual rice, sugar, salt and kerosene allotted under the public distribution system as part of Dispurs efforts to tame spiralling prices.         
	The state food and civil supplies department came up with the plan after consultations with stakeholders over the past fortnight.         
	Fair price shops, 34,536 in all, are run by individuals appointed by the government and sell PDS items to those holding ration cards. Currently, these shops sell only four items  rice, sugar, salt and kerosene.         
	According to the draft roadmap, 10,000 of these outlets will now be well-stocked with onions, potatoes, mustard oil, refined oil, soya oil, dal, atta, suji, maida, soap, milk, toothpaste, toothbrush and hair oil, to be made available at company/wholesale rates for all sections of consumers.         
	The goods will be retailed at rates fixed by the government, which will be significantly less than those in the open market as well as shopping malls known for their discounts on food items.        
	Economics suggests that short-listed suppliers will get ready access to these outlets, helping them increase their market share which would inevitably drive down prices.         
	The outlets, too, will earn a reasonable profit, the rates of which will be determined by Dispur.         
	The roadmap also plans to turn these shops into popular retail brands with a distinct name and logo.        
	Deputy commissioners will shortlist the outlets on the basis of the owners creditworthiness, integrity and the shops location.        
	Amar Dukan, Kam Dam, Grahak Mitra, Anna Suraksha Bhandar, Amar Dukam, Amar Bazar, Jugaad, Raijor Dukan and Aahar are some of the names being considered for the outlets, though Amar Dukan remains a favourite.         
	Companies that have been tapped to be part of the initiative so far include Tata Salt, Anupam Oil, Gokul, Fortune and Amul.         
	Shyam Lal Mewara, the principal secretary of the department, said Dispur was exploring all possible options to provide relief to all sections of consumers through fair price shops.         
	It is going to be a long-term arrangement, to be launched before the Pujas. It is a first such initiative in the country. Our role will be that of facilitator, removing the intermediaries to bring down prices, he said.                     
	A source said Dispur was pinning its hopes on this plan. With its earlier measures to check prices not showing the desired results and the Opposition making price rise an issue, Dispur has to do something fast on the price front, he said.         
	However, it is easier said than done.         
	Most fair price shops do not have an inspiring track record. Moreover, intermediaries who lose out will try their best to sabotage the move. Therefore, effective implementation and monitoring is needed, the source said.

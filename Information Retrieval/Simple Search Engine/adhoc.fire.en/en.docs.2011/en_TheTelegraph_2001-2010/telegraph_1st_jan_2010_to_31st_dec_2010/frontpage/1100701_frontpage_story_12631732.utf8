The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mutilation label on Maoists
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mutilation label on Maoists
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, June 30: Denied the weapons of their victims, the Maoists took their anger out on the dead CRPF men.        
	Officials said the Maoists mutilated some of the bodies after the surviving jawans had fought back and saved the weapons of their 26 slain colleagues from falling into rebel hands during yesterdays ambush in Dhaurai, Chhattisgarh.        
	About 10 bodies were badly damaged. The rebels had chopped off the hands and legs of these jawans, beheaded a few and cut off their vital organs, CRPF deputy commandant P.K. Singh said today.        
	If the brutality left the force seething in anger, the only consolation was it had been able to hit back.        
	I myself saw three Maoists killed, said 37-year-old Parmanand, who kept firing despite taking four bullets in his legs.        
	Chhattisgarh additional director-general of police (anti-Naxalite operations) Ramniwas said over 15 rebels had been killed.        
	None of the bodies has, however, been found. Maoists are known to take away with them bodies of comrades killed in encounters with security forces.        
	At a hospital in state capital Raipur, sombre CRPF jawans stood guard at the morgue where bodies of the 26 jawans were brought this morning.        
	The daylight attack, barely 3km from Dhaurai police station, had left the force stunned.        
	I am shocked, not because seeing the huge casualty but because of what is going on, constable R.K. Chaturvedi told The Telegraph. They (the Maoists) are not allowing the force to even raise its head.        
	Yesterdays attack came less than three months after the April 6 ambush in Dantewada that killed 75 CRPF jawans.        
	A police official said the jawans, who had passed through the ambush spot a few hours ago, had ignored the standard operating procedure by taking the same route back. When they passed through the road earlier, the rebels were watching their movement, the official said. Anticipating that the force would return by the same route, they laid the ambush and succeeded.        
	An expert on jungle warfare said jawans tend to become confident and callous when they near a police station, one reason for the heavy casualties.         
	In the Dantewada ambush, the rebels struck hardly 4-5km from a police station.        
	CRPF officials said lack of co-ordination between state police and the paramilitary force was also creating a problem in anti-Maoist operations. The issue came up at a high-level meeting chaired by chief minister Raman Singh this afternoon.         
	Among those present were CRPF director-general Vikram Sriwastava and Chhattisgarh police chief Vishwa Ranjan.        
	We are designing a change in strategy, additional DGP Ramniwas said. He, however, ruled out any co-ordination problem between the forces.         
	At a private hospital in Raipur, Parmanand couldnt get over the pain of abandoning the bodies of his dead colleagues.        
	We were left with no other option but to retreat, he said. We had to evacuate the injured jawans, protect the weapons and prevent further casualties.

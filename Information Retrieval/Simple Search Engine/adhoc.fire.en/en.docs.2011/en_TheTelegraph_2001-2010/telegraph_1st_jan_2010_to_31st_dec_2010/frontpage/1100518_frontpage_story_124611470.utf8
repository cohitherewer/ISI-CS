				                         Demonstration in protest against the alleged murder of journalist Nirupama Pathak in New Delhi. A Telegraph file picture.                                
	Koderma, May 18, (PTI): A local court extended the judicial custody of the mother of Nirupama Pathak for 14 days. Extending the judicial custody of Sudha, Chief Judicial Magistrate N K Agarwal allowed the police to interrogate her in judicial custody.  
	The preliminary report submitted by the Jharkhand State Forensic Science Laboratory to the state director general of police and additional director general (crime investigation) has concluded that the Delhi-based journalist Nirupama Pathak was murdered.  
	 The court had on May 15 rejected her bail petition. 	Meanwhile, Director General of Police Neyaz Ahmed said handwriting experts had sent their report on the suicide note, which had been purportedly left behind by the 22-year-old journalist who died on April 29. 	He, however, refused to divulge the contents of the report.							   
	According to state police sources forensic lab report has raised two important points, which showed Nirupama might have been murdered. Primarily the fan used to commit suicide was in perfect shape, which created anomaly as per the forensic teams investigation, police said. Secondly, the report says in case of suicide the ligature marks around the neck would be vertical. While with Nirupama, the marks were horizontal.							   
	Nirupama died under ambiguous circumstances at her family home in Koderma district of Jharkhand on April 29. She was in love with Priyabhanshu Ranjan, a Delhi-based journalist. But her family opposed the match as the boy was from a `lower' caste. Though her family members claim that the three-month pregnant journalist committed suicide the postmortem report prepared by doctors at a local hospital said she was murdered. However, experts at AIIMS Delhi raised doubts over the postmortem report, mentioning it had many flaws.  
	 The forensic report, however, does not mention other evidence collected by the police from Delhi and Koderma, which were also forwarded, to the laboratory for examination.							   
	The police besides investigating into suspicions of honour killing have also filed a case of rape and abetment to suicide against Nirupama's boyfriend Priyabhanshu Ranjan on the direction of the local court.  
	Priyabhanshu and other students and the journalsit fraternity have seeked CBI investigation in the death of Nirupama Pathak.

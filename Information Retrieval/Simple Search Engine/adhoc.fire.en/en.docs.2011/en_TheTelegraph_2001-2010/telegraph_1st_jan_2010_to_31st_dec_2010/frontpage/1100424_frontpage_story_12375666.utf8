          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 23: India is likely to receive a near-normal 98 per cent monsoon rainfall this year, the India Meteorological Department said today in its first forecast for the four-month season that begins on June 1.         
	The rainfall is likely to be 98 per cent of the long-period average rainfall of 89cm, the weather agency said, issuing a widely awaited forecast after the severe drought of 2009 that had depressed the yields of several crops.         
	The forecast is based on a statistical technique that uses five distant weather parameters as predictors of monsoon behaviour. But the department has also taken into account experimental forecasts from other institutions in India, the UK and the US.         
	A senior scientist told The Telegraph that two of the five parameters were favourable for the 2010 monsoon, two were neutral, and one was unfavourable.         
	At this point, the forecast for 2010 looks good for agriculture, said Laxman Singh Rathore, head of agrometeological services at the department. Last years monsoon deficit of 22 per cent had reduced Indias yields of pulses, soyabean, maize and groundnut.         
	India gets about 70 to 90 per cent of its annual rainfall during the four-month monsoon season.         
	The departments own forecasting technique as well as virtually all other forecasts from domestic and international weather researchers had failed to predict the drought of 2009. Predicting the monsoon is a challenge for everyone  all international models had predicted normal or excess rain last year, a scientist said. No model has been able to predict extreme deviations from normal.         
	The department will follow up todays forecast with an update in June that will include quantified forecasts for July and August  months crucial for crops  as well as regional forecasts for four zones  northwest, central, east and peninsular India.         
	The forecast of 98 per cent comes with an error margin of five per cent, which means the full range of forecast rainfall is 93 per cent to 102 per cent.         
	A slight warming of the sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean  a phenomenon called El Nino, which at times has been linked to a poor monsoon  is expected to persist until the early part of the season and weaken in the subsequent months, the department said. Some forecasts suggest that the Pacific Ocean temperatures will reduce by July-August.         
	Last seasons drought combined with other factors to push up food price inflation to alarming levels. In the second week of this month, food inflation accelerated to 17.65 per cent.

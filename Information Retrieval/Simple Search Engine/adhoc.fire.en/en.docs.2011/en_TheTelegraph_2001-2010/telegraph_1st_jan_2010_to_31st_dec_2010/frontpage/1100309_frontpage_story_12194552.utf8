	The chief minister had written to them personally to become members and they all had given their consent in writing, Bordoloi said.         
	It is for the first time in the history of the state that such top industrialists will visit together. Even in the country there has not been such a meeting of industrialists at one time, he said at a press conference.

	Bordoloi said the underlying objective of the board would be to speed up economic development in the state.         
	When the rest of the country is surging ahead and when there is stability in the state, can Assam lag behind, the minister said.        
	He said largescale investments were required to raise the income levels in the rural areas and generate jobs.

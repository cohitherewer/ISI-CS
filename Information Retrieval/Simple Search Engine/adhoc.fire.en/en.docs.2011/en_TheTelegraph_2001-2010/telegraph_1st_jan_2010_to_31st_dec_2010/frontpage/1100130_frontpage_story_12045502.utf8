          STEPHEN ADAMS                            Salinger: Recluse				                                 
	London, Jan. 29: The death of J.D. Salinger, the author of The Catcher in the Rye, has prompted rumours that a cache of unseen novels could at last be published.        
	Salinger, who became almost as famous for being a recluse as creating the disaffected teenager in Catcher, Holden Caulfield, is thought to have laboured for decades on works that he never wanted anyone else to read.        
	But his death aged 91 throws into question whether those manuscripts  said to number as many as 10 novels  could now see the light of day.        
	 He is thought to have written them in a concrete bunker in the grounds of his remote home in Cornish, New Hampshire.        
	Salinger bought it soon after Catcher, his most well-known and highly regarded work, was published in 1951. The book has sold more than 65 million copies worldwide.        
	The novel followed the exploits of Holden, a rebellious teenager who rails against the adult world after being chucked out of his fourth school.        
	Catchers literary and commercial success only served to disillusion Jerome David Salinger when it was published.        
	Moving to the 90-acre property in Cornish in 1953, he quickly gained a reputation as a recluse, refusing interviews and instructing his agent not to send on any fan mail. A rare photograph of the author, said to have been taken from a car window in 1988, gained notoriety due to the look of anger and alarm on his face as he is caught off guard by the unwelcome intrusion.        
	He did publish more books, including the collection For Esm  With Love and Squalor, the novel Franny and Zooey, and the novellas Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour  An Introduction. However, none reached the pitch of Catcher.

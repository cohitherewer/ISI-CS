	Sreejit Karmakars final journey home stretched 36 hours from Sunday morning with traffic snarls and his teachers decision not to return to the city delaying the progress of the ambulance carrying his body.         
	The Class IX student, who died after falling off a moving train in Sonepur on Friday night while returning from a school excursion, was cremated at Keoratola on Monday afternoon.        
	Two teachers of Sreejits school and two of his relatives were with his father Jayanta in a car that trailed the ambulance as it started the 600km journey from Sonepur to the city.        
	There was a massive traffic snarl on National Highway 83 near Chhapra, Bihar, where we were stuck for over four hours, said Jayanta.        
	Then at Kulgaria near Burdwan, on National Highway 2, the two teachers tried to get off the ambulance. We tried to convince them to accompany us to the city but they kept saying that they had done their duty, added Jayanta.        
	According to him, cops allowed the teachers to walk away after they spent nearly three hours at a police station.         
	In the city, the ambulance was first taken to the home of Sreejits aunt and then to a club in Manton, Behala, where the boys mother Rajyasree, who is separated from Jayanta, was waiting.         
	When the boys body was taken to his school, El-Bethel, neighbours and bystanders went berserk. Some of them blocked the road outside, while others forced their way into the school, which was closed on Monday to mourn Sreejits death, and damaged everything in sight        
	Furniture, computers, doors, windows and electrical fittings bore the brunt of their fury. A science teacher present on the premises was attacked and had to be rescued by cops.        
	Jayanta tried to stop the mob from damaging school property but few listened to him. The mob dispersed as the hearse headed for the boys home in Fakirpara.        
	Lets not waste any more time. Please let us free him, cried Rajyasree after placing a packet of chocolates and a photograph of the boy at his feet. The hearse soon left for the crematorium.        
	Shamik Debnath, the other boy who had fallen off the train, was operated on at a city nursing home on Monday. Four fingers in his right hand were amputated. He would need more surgeries.

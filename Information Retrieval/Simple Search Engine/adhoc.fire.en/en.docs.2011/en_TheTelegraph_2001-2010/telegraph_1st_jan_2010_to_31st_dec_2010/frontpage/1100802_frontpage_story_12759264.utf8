          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Itanagar, Aug. 1: The Indian Forest Service official of the Maharashtra cadre, V.S. Bardekar, who was abducted from a village in Arunachal Pradesh by the anti-talks faction of the NDFB, was released at Dhekiajuli in Assam this evening.        
	Militants snatched Bardekar from Daimara village of West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh, bordering Assams Sonitpur district, on May 12. The Pune-based Bardekar was on a private visit to photograph butterflies in a wildlife sanctuary.         
	Sources said the abductors released him after a Rs 1.4crore ransom which was scaled down from Rs 5 crore.         
	The director-general of police of Arunachal Pradesh, Kanwaljit Deol, confirmed Bardekars release late this evening but did not mention the ransom.        
	Bardekar was released this evening by his abductors from their hideout at Dhekiajuli. More than two and half months of relentless effort by both the Assam and Arunachal governments ensured his safe return. I have this much to say as detailed information is awaited. His physical condition is said to be stable and he will be flown to Pune tomorrow, Deol said.        
	Officials from both states had been trying to negotiate the safe return of the IFS official for more than one month now.         
	The forces initially zeroed in on Dhekiajuli after getting information on the location of an NDFB hideout but refrained from storming it lest the official was harmed.        
	Bardekar, a cadre of the 1984 batch, who was posted in Pune as joint director, directorate of social forestry, was a butterfly enthusiast and had gone to Daimara village, which falls within the Eagle Nest wildlife sanctuary, known for its butterfly variety, on the evening of May 12.        
	He was abducted by 11 youths, armed with automatic rifles and grenades, who arrived at the residence of former panchayat member Lama Norbu, where Bardekar was putting up, around 8pm.        
	They beat up a casual worker of the Arunachal Pradesh forest department, Payao Magaji, and a guide, Gombu Tsering, who were accompanying Bardekar, and whisked the official away.

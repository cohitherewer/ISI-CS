	Mumbai, Nov. 26: Sabira Khan, 42, was not at the Taj or the Trident on 26/11, but the terror that struck Mumbai that night has left her bedridden and her family struggling for survival two years on.         
	The teacher and wife of a port labourer was returning home to Mazgaons Bombay Port Trust Colony  a world away from the five-star hotels that were the defining targets of 26/11  after giving tuitions when a taxi blew up.         
	The blast was so massive that my mother was flung 30 feet away and spent the next year and a half getting surgeries in different city hospitals, said Habib, 25, the eldest of Sabiras seven children, who was standing across the road and received shrapnel injuries in the head.         
	Worried that his mother was late, Habib had been waiting for her at the entrance of the colony when he spotted her trying to the cross the road around 9.30pm. Seconds later, the explosion blew the taxi to bits.         
	RDX bombs had exploded in taxis in Mazgaon and Vile Parle and 166 people were massacred at seven locations that night, a large number of them ordinary Mumbaikars like Sabira making their way home from work. Many were left with permanent disabilities and a dark future.         
	I really dont know how my family will survive, said Habib. The Khans received Rs 1.5 lakh in compensation from the government and Rs 5,000 a month from a Tata trust for a year. But medical expenses alone cost them over Rs 6 lakh, Habib said.         
	Although disbursal of compensation for 26/11 victims has been much smoother than in previous terror cases, victims are hurt that the government has washed its hands of them after handing the cheques.         
	Sonia Gandhi, who visited Mumbai to meet the victims, told my mother at JJ Hospital that the government will provide compensation for her, foot the medical bills, and also give a job to a family member. We did receive the compensation, but there is no sign of anything more, said Habib, claiming he had to sell off his small cloth shop in Mumbra and the family had to mortgage a tenement it owned to raise money for his mothers treatment.         
	A two-month hospitality training that he received from the Taj hotel last year has not fetched him a job either.         
	Though the government said the medical treatment would be free, we had to pay from our pocket. I have sent the bills to the government agencies, but they keep giving excuses, he said.         
	Vishweshwar Pacharne, 24, a home guard who helped several commuters at CST escape and suffered bullet injuries himself, said: When I enquired with the railway authorities, they said jobs had been given only to the kin of those martyred in the carnage. I received Rs 1.45 lakh compensation from the Railway Claims Tribunal, but money cannot insure your future the way a permanent government job can.         
	Jagan Bokade, a 35-year-old Mira Road resident, was one of the first victims of Ajmal Kasab and Abu Ismail when the gunmen entered CST. The clearing agent had gone to the station to pick up a consignment. An AK-56 bullet fractured Bokades hip bones and after six surgeries and nine months in hospital, he resumed work in July this year. But he can only do a desk job now that earns him Rs 6,000.         
	It still pains a lot, but I had to resume work to keep the household expenses running. I travel by train from Mira Road to my office in JB Nagar, Andheri. I have received Rs 4.65 lakh in compensation, including Rs 1.65 lakh from the Railway Claims Tribunal. But I need to get another surgery done. My only demand is that the government should give my wife Archana a permanent job, he said.        
	Commerce graduate Ramzan Shariff, who suffered two bullet injuries and lost his grandfather in the CST attack, did get a railway job but as a peon. I have worked with ICICI Prudential, Axis Bank and Spanco Call Centre before the attacks, but I have no choice but to accept a peons job, said Ramzan, who works with the Central Railway headquarters at CST.

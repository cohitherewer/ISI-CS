                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cabinet on October 8, promises Munda
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Deputy CM Hemant Soren arrives in Ranchi from Delhi on Tuesday. (Prashant Mitra)                                  
	Ranchi, Sept. 28: Chief minister Arjun Munda will announce his council of ministers on October 8, a day after Mahalaya, amid indications that the tricky question of which ally gets how many berths was yet to be sorted out.        
	Amid pressure from Opposition Congress and JVM, representatives of which met Governor M..H. Farook today to seek the dismissal of the BJP-JMM-Ajsu government, Munda sent a letter to Raj Bhavan confirming the date.        
	I will submit a list of ministers on October 7, Munda wrote in his letter without citing reasons for the delay.         
	Delegations of the Congress, led by state party chief Pradeep Balmuchu, and JVM, led by Pradeep Yadav, met Farook today and presented a memorandum citing Article 164 (1-A) of the Constitution, which states that the number of ministers, including the chief minister, will not be less than 12.         
	But, the memorandum added, there are only three members in the Arjun Munda cabinet, which is against the provisions of Article 164 (1-A).         
	Munda, however, dismissed the demand, saying there was no illegality involved. We decided to delay cabinet expansion till the inauspicious phase of pitri paksha ends on October 7. The state is already passing through a bad phase and we did not want to add to the trouble, he maintained.        
	If Munda sticks to his October 8 date, it would mean that he needed 28 days to finalise his council of ministers since his swearing-in on September 11  the longest time taken by a Jharkhand chief minister. If the states first chief minister, Babulal Marandi, took about a fortnight in 2000 to finalise his team, Munda took seven and 17 days to expand his cabinet in 2003 and 2005, respectively.         
	Madhu Koda, the Independent MLA sworn in along with three ministers, took six days to expand his cabinet in 2006, while Shibu Soren took 10 days to expand his cabinet in 2009-2010.         
	Today, Munda claimed his alliance partners were in agreement over the cabinet expansion. But Hemant Soren, who returned from Delhi along with Sudesh Mahto today, did not sound happy at all.        
	We wanted him to expand the cabinet sooner than later. But everybody has his own line of thinking, he said.         
	Although Munda claimed otherwise, party sources admitted there was no agreement on the number as well as choice of portfolios to be allotted to coalition partners.         
	According to sources, a formula of giving five berths to JMM, four to BJP, two to Ajsu and one to the JD(U) had emerged. But, the BJP is now trying to leave out JD(U) and keep five berths, including the chief ministers, a source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | New loyalty test: the louder, the better
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                New loyalty test: the louder, the better
  - Kasab sentenced to death, streets erupt in jubilation
          OUR BUREAU                      Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam outside the court after the death sentence was delivered on Thursday. (PTI)                          
	May 6: Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam was asked outside court this afternoon: Sir, whats your score?        
	Nikam figured out the question in a split second, beamed like a gladiator and replied with a chilling echo of Ab Tak Chhappan: Thirty-eight death penalties and over 600 life terms.        
	Clap, clap, clap.        
	The crowd, not entirely made of journalists, could not resist the temptation to celebrate.                
	Crackers were burst, drums beaten, cheers whooped, effigies hanged and mock funerals held in an outbreak of exultation. Death to Kasab! Hang him! Hang him! they cried; Nikam waved heroically and flashed more Vs  the prize fighter whod delivered the knockout punch for India.        
	The rapturous scenes played themselves out in several pockets in Mumbai after Ajmal Kasab was sentenced to death today.         
	A handful of celebrations, suitably tagged to announce their political affiliations, were for the benefit of television cameras but some offered an outlet to let off lynch steam.        
	For others, displaying placards proclaiming retribution for Kasab was part of efforts to distance themselves from stereotypes and, perhaps, pre-empt a backlash by lumpen elements on the lookout to exploit inflammable opportunities.        
	At least one placard, carried by a fez-wearing boy who could not have been more than 10, wanted Kasab to be hanged at Bhendi Bazaar, a Mumbai locality once known for applause when Pakistan defeated India in cricket matches.        
	Cricket no longer carries the same raw edge. The Butcher of Bombay appears to have become the latest Tebbit test barometer, the loyalty measure named after the UK politician who argued that whether ethnic minorities were truly British could be gauged by their support for the England cricket team.        
	Mohammed Saeed Noori, the general secretary of Raza Academy that organised the celebrations in Bhendi Bazaar, told The Telegraph: Our member Maulana Khalool Rehman has offered to hang Kasab at Bhendi Bazaar junction if the government doesnt find a hangman.         
	Another organisation, called the National Institute of Jehad Against Atrocities and Terrorism (Nijaat), distributed sweets and burst crackers near Mumbai Central railway station.         
	The death sentence  subject to at least two more layers of judicial ratification and the option of approaching the President  had been propelled hard by mostly television-generated public opinion in the run-up.         
	Minutes after the pronouncement, sections of the citizenry appeared to resort to coarse festivity rather than sombre reflection on the legal course of the nations most watched terror-trial.         
	Some were eye-for-an-eye mobs, which would probably have resorted to vandalism had the special court not endorsed the sentence they had already pronounced on the streets and in television studios.        
	Referring specifically to the mob frenzy, some behavioural scientists and sociologists said they were not surprised by such a response. Quick vigilante justice has become a passion with the Indian middle class, said sociologist Ashis Nandy.        
	Rajat Mitra, a consultant psychologist in Delhi, said: This unrestrained show of emotions is not a sign of a mature society  people are reacting almost as if a fear has been exorcised, a witch has been burnt, theres no more danger to them.        
	Maturity would have shown up as calmness and dignity, Mitra said. Indians have forgotten to be satisfied without being vulgar and crude, added Nandy.                   A man dances after lighting crackers to celebrate   the death sentence. (Reuters)    
	It appears that people want vengeance  not justice, said sociologist Andre Beteille. But the medias role is crucial in whipping up passions. Im not really surprised, he said.         
	Psychologists say the medias coverage of 26/11, too, would have contributed to a high level of emotional engagement among the public. Its then easier to emotionally identify with the event, said Vivek Benegal, a psychologist at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences. When youre part of a mob behaviour, you lose your frontal lobe, Benegal said.        
	The frontal lobe is the zone of the brain that allows humans to use judgement and distinguish right from wrong. Its the brake that resides in the brain, he said. Rational people can behave differently in a mob  the mob thinks for you.

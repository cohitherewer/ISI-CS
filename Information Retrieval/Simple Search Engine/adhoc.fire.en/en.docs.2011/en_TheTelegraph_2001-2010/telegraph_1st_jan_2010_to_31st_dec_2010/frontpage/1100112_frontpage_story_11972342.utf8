          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                             JMM party workers present a fresh radish to chief minister Shibu Soren on his 66th birthday at his residence at Morabadi in Ranchi on Monday. Picture by Manik Bose nBirthday blues for Soren, Marandi, P15                                  
	Ranchi, Jan. 11: Chief minister Shibu Soren is getting a taste of coalition politics with deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto of the Ajsu proving to be a hard bargainer, holding up a promised announcement of ministerial portfolios today and keeping the state machinery in limbo.        
	Soren, who was busy celebrating his birthday, had inducted nine ministers in his cabinet on Saturday and had promised to allocate portfolios today. But, by the end of the day, it was clear he was finding it difficult to finalise names, at one stage forcing Raj Bhavan to call up his office for a timeframe.        
	The chief minister held a one-on-one with another of his deputies, BJP leader Raghubar Das, but sources agreed Ajsu was proving to be difficult to satisfy. Both the JMM and the BJP had reconciled to giving the home department to Mahto, but now, it seemed, he was also asking for industries and water resources.        
	This apart, the JMM was concerned about the relative inexperience of its ministers  at least six of the 11 were first timers. And given the cap on the strength of the cabinet, each minister would end up getting two to three departments.        
	They are still brainstorming over portfolios within the party. They are under immense pressure to perform in the next 100 days, said a JMM leader.        
	 Moreover, the immediate task before the state government was to prepare a paper to be presented at a meeting of state finance ministers convened by the Centre on January 13 in New Delhi.         
	Das, who was likely to get the finance portfolio, would probably be attending.        
	Publicly, Das and Mahto, the primary players in the behind-the-scenes dramatics of the day, claimed there were no differences of opinion on portfolios.        
	According to a tentative plan, the BJP was set to get finance, commercial taxes, energy, urban development, health, revenue amp; land reforms, transport, food amp; civil supplies and co-operatives.         
	The lone JD(U) minister was likely to get welfare and labour departments.        
	The Ajsu was likely to get home, roads, building, sports, forest amp; environment, water resources and drinking water and sanitation.        
	The JMMs three ministers were likely to be allocated rural development, human resources development and agriculture with Soren keeping the rest of the departments, including mining and personnel.        
	With Governor K. Sankaranarayanan scheduled to visit his home state of Kerala for Pongal on January 15, even Raj Bhavan, sources agreed, was getting anxious.         
	There was no indication from the chief ministers office till evening, said a Raj Bhavan official.

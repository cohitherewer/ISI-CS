                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Thai red curry, to please Calcutta bride Sakshi

	Dehra Dun, July 5: Sakshi Singh Rawat carried more from Calcutta to her wedding here yesterday than the lehenga designed by Sabyasachi Mukherjee.        
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis wife also brought her fondness for Thai cuisine, the taste for which she acquired while working as a hotel management intern in Calcutta.        
	Sources close to her family said the wedding menu was a mix of Indian, Thai, Chinese and Italian, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. That included Thai red curry, said to be Sakshis favourite. The main course had 25 items, along with 15 varieties of snacks.        
	Sakshi grew fond of Thai cuisine while working in Calcutta, said one of her friends from Dehra Duns Welham Girls School.         
	The wedding, Kumaon style, took over four hours. The couple exchanged garlands  jaimalas 3.5ft-long and made with 10kg of rajinigandha and 8kg of roses from Delhi Flower Decorators  around 9.30pm. A local DJ, Kingsey, handled the music, playing soft Hindi and English numbers, in synch with the couples choice, the sources said.        
	A key element was the confidentiality pact with the venue, Vishranti Resorts and Spa, owned by BJP leader and former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, and managed by former Ranji player Michael Dalvi.        
	A Bengal link emerged in the resort, too. The farmhouse, all of whose eight bedrooms and cottages had been booked, has rooms with paintings by artists from the Shantiniketan school.         
	The room tariffs range from Rs 7,000 to Rs 14,000. Resort officials refused to divulge how much they had been paid.        
	According to government officials in Dehra Dun, the wedding could be held in almost complete secrecy also because Sakshis elder sister, Abhilasha Bisht, is an IPS officer, now on deputation to the UN. There were murmurs among some bureaucrats and top cops, though, about being left out of what appeared like the towns biggest event in recent months.        
	Dalvi, who runs Vishranti and was at the wedding, told The Telegraph: Sakshis family had booked the resort some eight months back. The condition was to keep it very confidential.        
	The only local resident on the small guest list of 50 to 60 was Sudhir Windlass, owner of Windlass Steelcrafts.         
	Dhoni is the brand ambassador of the firm, which makes swords and khukhris for the Indian Army. The India skipper had visited the Uttarakhand capital last month for an event related to Windlass and the sources said it was around that time he and Sakshi gave the final touches to their wedding plans.        
	While most of Sakshis Welham classmates were taken by surprise, some claimed they had got wind of her wedding plans after she and Dhoni visited Mussoorie this February along with cricketer R.P. Singh.         
	Dalvi said the couple flew to Delhi early this morning, a couple of hours after their midnight pheras.

  - Security teams battle Ulfa in two districts          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Dibrugarh/Guwahati, April 11: A policeman was killed and another seriously injured in an encounter with Ulfa militants at Kochgaon Tinthengia in Dibrugarh district this evening while three others gave a joint team of police and the army the slip around 8 tonight in another encounter in Tinsukia.         
	The twin encounters came within hours of a group of citizens launching a fresh initiative to get Ulfa and the government to the negotiating table.        
	The police said the dead cop was Sisuram Das of 19 IRB. The injured jawan, Dulumoni Bora, is from the same battalion. Bora has been shifted to Assam Medical College Hospital in a critical condition.         
	None of the militants died.        
	Home department sources said it was an operation based on source information and handled by district police. Dibrugarh deputy commissioner G.D. Tripathy said the operation was based on reliable actionable information.        
	Additional director-general of police (special branch) Khagen Sarma said the police team launched an operation in the area this afternoon on the basis of information provided by three arrested Ulfa cadres that a team of about five hardcore rebels, led by Ratul Bora, was camping in the area. The trio were arrested while trying to extort money from a brick kiln in the area.        
	He said the team from Moran and Khowang police stations went to the specific area around 5pm when they were met by indiscriminate firing from a cluster of huts in the village leading to the casualty. Though the police team fired back, the rebels fled.         
	Asked if the encounters reflect the regrouping of the rebel outfit, Sarma said: They are trying to but have not been successful.        
	In the other encounter, the rebels, one of whom is identified as Bhadia Bhumij, escaped after a brief encounter with securitymen at Kulapathar along the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border in Tinsukia district. A team of Rupai-based 8 Garwal Rifles and Assam police cordoned off the house where the rebels were hiding from two sides. But the Ulfa cadres escaped in the darkness.                                 
	made good use of darkness after firing a few rounds through the back door into an adjoining jungle.              
	Police sources said based on intelligence inputs that the militants were taking shelter in the village, a team of Rupai-based 8 Garwal Rifles and Assam police personnel raided the village and even managed to cordon off the house where the rebels were hiding from two sides. However, the Ulfa cadres made good use of darkness after firing a few rounds through the back door into an adjoining jungle.        
	A combing operation has been launched.

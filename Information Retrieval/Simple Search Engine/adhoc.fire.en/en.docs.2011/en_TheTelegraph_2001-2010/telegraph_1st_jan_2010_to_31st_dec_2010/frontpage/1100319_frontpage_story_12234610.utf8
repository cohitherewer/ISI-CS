The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | The toast of steel majors
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                The toast of steel majors
          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                                        Bokaro steel plant      
	Bokaro, March 18: With ArcelorMittal waiting in the wings, Posco couldnt have been far behind.        
	So, when a three-member team from Posco visited Bokaro steel plant on Tuesday, it was the fifth time in the last two months that representatives of the South Koeran steel major were doing so.         
	Only, the last visit  the South Koreans were accompanied by Bokaro plant director V. K. Srivastava  came after a momentous dinner meeting in New Delhi the previous day where an in-principle deal was clinched to opt for a joint venture with state-owned SAIL to set up a half a million tonne steel plant in Bokaro with an investment of around Rs 15,000 crore.        
	Though nothing has been signed as yet, senior officials in Bokaro claimed the deal was done.         
	Good news for Bokaro that is already being eyed by ArcelorMittal which has zeroed in on Petarwar and Kasmar blocks of the district after having given up plans to set up its 6MTPA plant at Torpa and Kamdara blocks of Khunti and Gumla districts in the face of local resistance.         
	This apart, Bokaro Steel City  so christened by the PSU steel giant  is also playing host to yet another steel firm, Electrosteel Castings Ltd, a Calcutta-based company that is using Chinese technology and workforce to build a 3.2MT steel plant at Siyaljori, 34 km from here.        
	For Posco, the Bokaro understanding seems to have come at a good time, what with its 12MT Orissa project unable to get off the drawing board due to land hurdles, forcing the South Korean company to explore options in Karnataka and Maharashtra.         
	For Bokaro Steel, apart from the obvious gains that a tie-up with a multinational would accrue, the PSUs keenness in pursuing a joint venture was due to Poscos foray into the latest FINEX technology.         
	Till the third quarter of 2009-10 (ie April 09 till December 09) Bokaro Steels profit touched Rs 1,512 crore. But, 2007-08 was as one of the best years for the plant, as its profitability reached Rs 2,830 crore. The very next financial year (2008-09) it came down to Rs 1,292 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Himanta twist to missing diaries 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Himanta twist to missing diaries 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, July 13: Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma today alleged that a coterie, led by former chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, had hatched a conspiracy to launch a tirade against him through Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader Akhil Gogoi.        
	In a twist to the missing diaries case, Sarma said one of the diaries of the case registered against him at Panbazar police station never went missing. Samiti leader Gogoi had last week produced two files, claiming them to be the two missing case diaries.         
	If the original case diary  which is in the custody of the designated court  was not missing, then how could he find it? Sarma asked.        
	The minister said the diary of the case registered at Chandmari police station is missing. But in that case too, the diary was reconstructed by the police through a judicial order since 80 per cent of the original documents were available. Moreover, I was cleared by the court in that case, Sarma said.        
	Sarma claimed that a coterie of his rivals, including Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and a PWD contractor, has used Akhil Gogoi to make baseless charges against him in a bid to finish his political career.        
	He also said he had reasons to suspect that the missing case diary was with former DIG A.K. Roy, who might have sold it to Mahanta who subsequently gave it to Gogoi.        
	I have evidence that last Friday Mahanta met Akhil Gogoi, he claimed.         
	Sarma also said Mahantas son Shyamanta Kashyap had prior knowledge about what allegations Akhil Gogoi was going to bring against him, which proved that Mahanta was behind the conspiracy.        
	 On the one hand Mahanta is using Gogoi to malign me and on the other, he tried to use me to finish his rivals in his own party. He is playing nasty politics, he said.         
	Sarma claimed that Mahanta met him in Delhi on June 19 and gave him a CD containing evidence against some AGP leaders.         
	Mahanta, however, denied the allegations levelled by Sarma against him, saying that the minister was unnecessarily dragging his name into the controversy.         
	Convening a press conference within hours of Sarmas, Gogoi said he had met Mahanta only once and by linking him with the former chief minister, the health minister tried to discredit the KMSS.         
	 Gogoi accused Sarma of having stolen the two case diaries himself. He said Sarma had kept the two diaries with a friend and it was from there that the KMSS had got hold of the two files.         
	Gogoi also questioned Sarmas contention that the Panbazar police station case diary had never gone missing. If it had not gone missing, why did the high court ask the police to reconstruct the case diaries, he asked.

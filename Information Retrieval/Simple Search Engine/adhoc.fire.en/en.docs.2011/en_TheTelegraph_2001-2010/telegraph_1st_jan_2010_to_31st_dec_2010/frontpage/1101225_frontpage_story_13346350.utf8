          SUMIR KARMAKAR                              
	Guwahati, Dec. 24: The HIV-positive orphan girl, who was abandoned by her family members in Nalbari, will stay at a city-based community care centre for a few more weeks before the Assam State AIDS Control Society takes a decision on accepting the offer from organisations eager to take permanent care of the four-year-old.        
	The community care centre at Beharbari is run by Bharukha Public Welfare Trust, an NGO. The Assam State AIDS Control Society will seek permission from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to extend her stay at the community care centre at the Beharbari area in Guwahati where she is being taken care of.         
	Hem Chandra Barman, the joint director (care, support and treatment) of the society, said, Though three organisations have contacted us offering to take care of the girl, we are not in favour of taking a hasty decision to send her outside the state. Her condition is improving and today she was seen playing with dolls, greeting people and taking food. We want to keep her here for a few more weeks before we decide. We will extend her stay and if necessary we will seek permission from NACO.         
	According to NACO guidelines, an HIV-positive child can stay at a community care centre for only 15 days. The girl from Nalbari has already spent 12 days. This is a special case. Till a permanent centre is decided on, we can allow extension of her stay at the community care centre, NACOs team leader (in-charge) in Guwahati Huidrom Rosemara said.

          ANUSUA MUKHERJEE                            Gender Shadow: Playing with Possibilities to Create Change staged at Studio 21. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha                                  
	On the day of Holi, with Rang barse playing loudly in the background, a doting mother cajoles her reluctant son to join the family celebrations. There are whispers in the boys memory  of an uncle who had used the occasion to get uncomfortably close once, twice, perhaps several times in the past.        
	But the boy must put away his fears, because participating unquestioningly in every family occasion is a part of growing up. And to maintain the sanctity of the family, every awkward incident must be hushed up. The boy gives in         
	A young girl speaks on her cellphone while standing in a crowded bus. She talks about her unwillingness to go out with her girlfriend, who will be accompanied by her boyfriend. You know I dont like men, she says.        
	A seated co-passenger keeps on making passes at the girl, then touches her, at which she shouts. A figure wearing a mask with a long nose, reminiscent of ultra-violent Alex in the murder scene from Stanley Kubricks A Clockwork Orange, silently makes his way through the scene as the girl screams.        
	These and some other similar scenes of oppression made up Gender Shadow: Playing with Possibilities to Create Change, presented by students from Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology in Bangalore at Studio 21 on Monday.        
	It was evident from this invitation to interrupt injustice that it was theatre with a difference. Indeed, this was not theatre in the traditional sense of the term at all, but a forum, which blurred the distinction between actors and audience by asking one to merge into the other. So instead of actors and spectators as distinct entities, there were spect-actors, members of the audience or performers from within the drama itself, who could intervene in a given scene and thus change the course of the play.        
	In a long modernist tradition that perhaps goes back to Brechts idea of theatre as collective experiment, Shristis Gender Shadow did away with the assumption of the audiences passivity as it invited viewers to evaluate, improvise, and actively alter the reality they were being presented with.        
	Arzu Mistry, a visual artist and arts educator who conceptualised the set pieces along with the students of Srishti, says that this is Theatre of the Oppressed, which was made popular in Brazil by Augusto Boal in the 1970s and later spread to other countries of Europe and Asia.        
	All the characters were developed by the students from their ideas and experience of the ways in which different stereotypes operate in society. That way, even the script is as fluid as the performance, without a definite sense of closure, containing unresolved tensions, which must be sorted out by the spect-actors according to their individual ideas of justice.        
	Most members of the audience at Studio 21 were particularly keen to change the scene in the bus. As the scene was played out again, a viewer got into the role of the girl being harassed to hit the molester with her bag, while another tried to beat the abuser at his own game by getting into the spirit of the obscenities being spewed.        
	For those eager to play with further possibilities, there are two more shows of Gender Shadow coming up at The Basement (in Samilton hotel) and at Womens Christian College (in Kalighat) later this week.

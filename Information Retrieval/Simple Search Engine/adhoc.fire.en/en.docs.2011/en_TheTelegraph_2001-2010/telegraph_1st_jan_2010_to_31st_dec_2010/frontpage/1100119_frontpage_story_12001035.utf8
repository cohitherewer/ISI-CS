  - Sankaranarayanan leaves tomorrow        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                             NO REGRETS: Governor K. Sankaranarayanan in Ranchi on Monday. Picture by Manik Bose                                        
	Ranchi, Jan. 18: Governor K. Sankaranarayanan, who spent around six months here to bring in a semblance of governance in politically turbulent Jharkhand, is now leaving the state, having installed a coalition government headed by a regional party, but unchanged in his views about the limited abilities of such local outfits.        
	I still hold the view that regional parties cannot undertake wholesome development of the state, he said, reiterating earlier statements that invited criticism from the Shibu Soren-led JMM that went on to win 18 seats in the Assembly elections and become the pivot around which a new government was formed.        
	Regional parties cannot have the whole state in their hand as they have presence in a few districts only. So, their contribution cannot be very high, the governor said when asked about his views on the state government that was sworn in on December 30, 2009, after the BJP offered support to the JMM, which was also backed by the Sudesh Mahto-led Ajsu.        
	On the other hand, national parties have an ideology. Regional parties have no national, economic or foreign policy. Their ambition is too small, just to get power, Sankaranarayanan maintained, days before he was scheduled to leave the state for his next assignment as Maharashtra governor.         
	Yet he maintained he had no regrets about his short, yet eventful stint in Jharkhand, having been able to restore peoples faith in the administration that was going through a rough patch due to his predecessor, Syed Sibtey Razis controversial tenure.        
	Satisfaction is always relative. I got 85 days to perform. By the time I settled, elections were declared bringing the model code into force. So, I got a little time for the people, said Sankaranarayanan in an exclusive interview to The Telegraph.        
	He is scheduled to bid goodbye to Jharkhand on Wednesday and take oath in Maharashtra on Friday. His successor, governor-designate M..H. Farook, will be coming here on Thursday to take the oath of office, also on Friday.        
	Taking over the reigns of the troubled state on July 26, 2009, the Congress wanted Sankaranarayanan to bring the administration back on track.         
	In the short time he has been here, Sankaranarayanan did his best to revive the public distribution system. Sugar was made available in ration shops after a long time, and his decision to distribute 35kg foodfgrain free to the poor was lauded by the needy.        
	Also, it was during his tenure that state vigilance bureau was able to tighten its noose around corrupt former ministers, including Madhu Koda, Anosh Ekka, Harinarayan Rai, and bureaucrats and government engineers.         
	I knew my tenure was short. My task was cut out. I was to hold elections and I am happy the elections were held smoothly under Presidents rule, he said.        
	For all the political overtones in his appointment, Sankaranarayanan made sure of staying away from controversy. I did not play politics here. I had already declared that had I wanted to play politics I would prefer to go to Kerala. When I came as governor I was a full-time governor, he said, reiterating what he had told The Telegraph in an earlier interview.                                            
	Despite his well-known views on regional outfits, Sankaranarayanan did not delay a moment in inviting Soren to form a government once he said he had a majority.         
	Moreover, he informed me that he wanted to expand his cabinet at 5pm on January 9 and I was ready to administer the oath to the ministers by 6.30pm that day, he pointed out.        
	I have always believed in democracy and transparency and stressed the need for an elected government. I did not take up the issue of mining leases or land for industries, Sankaranarayanan said, explaining that he believed such contentious decisions were best left for an elected government.        
	On Soren, the governor said the JMM chief was an experienced and able man. I would have supported him had I been here, he said.
